Sure, let's solve this problem step by step using a mathematical approach to find the smallest \( k \) such that crises will never happen.

Given:
- The length of the regular roll is \( \ell \) centimetres.
- Nick uses \( n \) centimetres of loo roll each time he visits the toilet.
- Nick uses a backup roll system with \( k \) layers of rolls, where each layer can be used sequentially.

The goal is to find the smallest \( k \) such that no crises occur, which means the total amount of paper used from all rolls must be sufficient to cover \( n \) centimetres each time.

Let's derive the solution:
1. The total amount of paper used each time is \( n \) centimetres.
2. If the first roll runs out, Nick will take paper from the second roll, and so on until the \( k \)-th roll.
3. Therefore, if any roll runs out before Nick needs to use \( n \) centimetres again, it means the total amount of paper used from all rolls must be sufficient to cover \( n \) centimetres.
4. The total amount of paper used from all rolls must be \( k \times n \) centimetres to ensure no crises occur.
5. Since the rolls are replenished after each use, the total amount of paper used from all rolls must be less than or equal to \( \ell \) centimetres.
6. Therefore, we need \( k \times n \leq \ell \) to ensure no crises occur.
7. To find the smallest \( k \), we solve for \( k \) in the inequality \( k \times n \leq \ell \).

The smallest \( k \) is given by:
\[ k = \left\lceil \frac{\ell}{n} \right\rceil \]

Let's implement this in Python:

```python
import math

def min_k(ell, n):
    return math.ceil(ell / n)

# Read input from stdin
input_line = input().strip()
ell, n = map(int, input_line.split())

# Output the result
print(min_k(ell, n))
```

This code reads the input values \( \ell \) and \( n \), calculates the smallest \( k \) using `math.ceil` to ensure it is an integer, and outputs the result.
