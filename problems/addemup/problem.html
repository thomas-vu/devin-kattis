<p>Simon is a contestant on the new exciting game show, Add â€™Em
    Up! In this show, contestants are given a set of cards with
    multi-digit numbers on them, and need to select two cards that
    add up to a given sum. However, to make things more
    interesting, the font that the cards are printed in (see below)
    means that certain cards will display different numbers if
    turned upside-down, and it is legal to turn either or both of
    the cards if necessary to generate the sum. Please help Simon
    win the game!</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of cards, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, the desired sum. The
    second line will contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000\, 000$</span> inclusive. You may
    assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 100\,
    000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq s\leq
    200\, 000\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should be a single line consisting of the string
    <tt class="tt">YES</tt> if two cards can be chosen such that
    (in some orientation) they add up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, and the string <tt class="tt">NO</tt> otherwise.</p>
