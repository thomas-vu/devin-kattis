<p>Pelle is building a new advanced underground drill. He wants
    to build the drill out of a new titanium-aluminium-magnesium
    alloy. Such an alloy can be mixed in many ways. If an alloy is
    made with the ratios <span class="tex2jax_process">$x, y,
    z$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$x + y + z =
    1$</span>) of titanium, aluminium and magnesium, the alloy gets
    a hardness of <span class="tex2jax_process">$xy$</span>, and a
    price of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x + y$</span> SEK per
    kilogram.</p>
<p>Pelle only has a fixed amount of money per kilogram that he
    can spend on alloys for his drills. What is the maximum
    hardness he can get on his new alloy?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains a decimal number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le c &lt; 2$</span>, between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> digits after the decimal point) –
    the amount of money in SEK that Pelle can spend per kilogram
    alloy.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single decimal number, the maximum hardness of
    Pelle’s alloy.</p>
<p>Your answer will be considered correct if you have an
    absolute error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">${10}^{-6}$</span>.</p>
