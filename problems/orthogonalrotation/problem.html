<div class="problembody">
<p>You are given two vectors <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_1, v_2$</span> of the same length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. You need to make them
    fit together, which means that they have to be orthogonal to
    one another. Possibly they fit together from the start, but if
    not we can amend this. We can rotate <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_2$</span>, meaning that we can take the
    last value in <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_2$</span> and
    put it at the front.</p>
<p>We can do this again and again to get new versions of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_2$</span>, until we have done
    it <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> times and are back
    where we started.</p>
<p>Note that to check whether <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_1, v_2$</span> are orthogonal we take the
    dot product of the vectors. If this dot product is zero they
    are orthogonal. The dot product is the sum of the product of
    the first values, the product of the second values and so
    on.</p>
<p>For what number of rotations do the vectors fit
    together?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$</span>, the
    number of coordinates the vectors have. The next two lines give
    the two vectors. Each vector is given as a series of space
    separated integers. Each value is from <span class="tex2jax_process">$-100$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print all numbers of rotations that make the vectors fit
    together, that is to say if moving the last value to the front
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> times makes them fit
    together you should print <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (possibly among other values). We
    are only considering values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k
    \geq 0$</span> which are less than the length of the vectors.
    Print the values in ascending order, one number per line. If
    there are no such values, print <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> instead.</p>
