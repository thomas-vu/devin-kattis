<div class="problembody">
<p>You are travelling in a foreign country. Although you are
    also open to eat some regional food, you just cannot resist
    after you have found an Italian restaurant which offers pizza.
    Unfortunately the menu is written in the foreign language, so
    the list of ingredients of the pizzas are incomprehensible to
    you. What will you do?</p>
<p>One thing that you notice is that each pizza has an Italian
    name, which sounds quite familiar to you. You even remember for
    each named pizza what the ingredients of this pizza usually
    are. You want to use that information to figure out what the
    possible meaning of each word on the list of ingredients
    is.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; t \le 20$</span>). The first line of
    each input gives the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> of pizzas on the menu
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 60$</span>). The
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \cdot n$</span>
    lines describe the pizzas on the menu. Each pizza description
    starts with one line containing the name of the pizza. The name
    of the pizza consists of between <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> uppercase and lowercase letters.
    The next line starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_ i$</span>, giving the number of
    ingredients of the pizza on the menu (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m_ i \le 20$</span>). The rest of the
    line contains the <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_ i$</span>
    ingredients separated by spaces. Each ingredient is a word
    consisting of between <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> lowercase
    letters. The third line of each pizza description gives the
    ingredients in your native language in the same format. Note
    that the number of ingredients may differ, because each
    restaurant may use slightly different ingredients for pizzas
    with the same name, so the ingredients you remember for a pizza
    with that name may not match the actual ingredients.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case print all pairs of words (<span class="tex2jax_process">$w_1, w_2$</span>) where <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_1$</span> is an ingredient in the foreign
    language that could be the same ingredient as <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_2$</span> because <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_2$</span> appear on the same set of
    pizzas. Sort the pairs in increasing lexicographical order by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_1$</span>, and in case of a
    tie in increasing lexicographical order by <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_2$</span>. Print a blank line between
    different test cases.</p>
