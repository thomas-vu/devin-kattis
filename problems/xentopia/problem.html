<p>The city of Xentopia has a well-connected railway network.
    The city has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> junctions
    numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. There are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> pairs of railway
    tracks that exist between the junctions. Trains can travel in
    both directions on each track. Each railway track is labelled
    either red, blue, or white in colour.</p>
<p>Tima, a tourist in the city, wants to travel from junction
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> to junction
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> in the minimum
    possible time. She has a map of the railway network that she
    can use to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>Tima, being rather eccentric, has an interesting constraint
    for her travel: She wants to travel via exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_1$</span> red tracks, exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_2$</span> blue tracks, and any number of
    white tracks, in any order. She is fine with using a railway
    track more than once.</p>
<p>Can you tell the minimum time Tima will take to go from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, ensuring that her constraint is
    not violated?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains four space-separated integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 450$</span>); <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq M \leq 1\, 100$</span>); <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_1$</span>; and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_2$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq k_1, k_2 \leq 800$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_1 \cdot k_2 \leq 800$</span>).
    Following are <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines.
    Each line contains four space-separated integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$U~ V~ X~ C$</span>, denoting that a track
    exists between junction <span class="tex2jax_process">$U$</span> and junction <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq U, V \leq N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$U \neq
    V$</span>); the train covers this track in <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> seconds, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq X \leq 10^9$</span>); and the track
    is labelled colour <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>,
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq C \leq 2$</span>). A
    white track is denoted by <span class="tex2jax_process">$C=0$</span>, a red track is denoted by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C=1$</span>, and a blue track is
    denoted by <span class="tex2jax_process">$C=2$</span>.</p>
<p>The last line contains two space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq S \leq N$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq T \leq N$</span>), the source and destination of Timaâ€™s
    journey, respectively. Note: <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> may be equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single integer denoting the total time Tima would
    take. If it is not possible for Tima to reach her destination
    using exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_1$</span> red
    tracks, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_2$</span> blue tracks,
    and any number of white tracks, output <tt class="ttfamily">-1</tt>.</p>
