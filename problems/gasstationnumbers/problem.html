<div class="problembody">
<p>Many gas stations use plastic digits on an illuminated sign
    to indicate prices. When there is an insufficient quantity of a
    particular digit, the attendant may substitute another one
    upside down.</p>
<p>The digit “6” looks much like “9” upside down. The digits
    “0”, “1” and “8” look like themselves. The digit “2” looks a
    bit like a “5” upside down (well, at least enough so that gas
    stations use it).</p>
<p>Due to rapidly increasing prices, a certain gas station has
    used all of its available digits to display the current price.
    Fortunately, this shortage of digits need not prevent the
    attendant from raising prices. She can simply rearrange the
    digits, possibly reversing some of them as described above.</p>
<p>Your job is to compute, given the current price of gas, the
    next highest price that can be displayed using exactly the same
    digits.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several lines, each containing between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> digits (to account for future
    prices) and a decimal point immediately before the last digit.
    There are no useless leading zeroes; that is, there is a
    leading zero only if the price is less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. An input line containing a
    decimal point alone terminates the input. There are at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$250$</span> test cases.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each number in the input, output the next highest price
    that can be displayed using the same digits and the same format
    rules. If the price cannot be raised, print “<tt class="ttfamily">The price cannot be raised</tt>”.</p>
