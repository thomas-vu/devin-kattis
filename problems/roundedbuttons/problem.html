<p>Most styles of graphical user interface make use of lots of
    rectangles. Buttons are rectangular, menus are rectangular and
    windows are rectangular. Some styles of user interface exhibit
    a softer appearance by using rounded rectangles for some
    components. As illustrated below, a rounded rectangle replaces
    the sharp corners of an ordinary rectangle with a smooth
    quarter circles.</p>

<p>Using a coordinate system with the <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> axis pointing to the right and the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> axis pointing down, a
    rounded rectangle is described by giving the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x, y$</span> locations of the left and top
    edges. The width, <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>,
    describes the distance between the left and right edges, and
    the height, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>, describes
    the distance between the top and the bottom edges. The radius
    used for the quarter-circle rounded corners is given by the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> parameter.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100$</span>. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain one
    test case. A test case has a rounded rectangle description and
    mouse click locations. The rectangle is given by <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> real numbers for the parameters
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>. These parameters always describe
    a legal rounded rectangle. In particular, it is guaranteed that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x, y \le 1\, 000$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; w, h \le 1\, 000$</span>,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq 2r \leq \min
    (w,h)$</span>. After the rectangle description is an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le m \le 1\, 000$</span>.
    Following this on the same line are <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> pairs of real numbers, each pair
    representing the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates of a mouse
    click. All mouse clicks are in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x, y \leq 2\, 000$</span>. All real
    numbers given as input have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> digits after the decimal
    point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each mouse click location, output <tt class="ttfamily">inside</tt> if the location is inside the rounded
    rectangle, or <tt class="ttfamily">outside</tt> otherwise. A
    mouse click right on the edge of a rounded rectangle should be
    classified as inside.</p>
