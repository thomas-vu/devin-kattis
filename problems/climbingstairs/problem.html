<p>Your workplace recently announced a staircase cup with some
    fabulous prizes to win. The rules of participation are simple:
    Each day, it is possible to gain one point, and at the end of
    the month, whoever has the most points wins. In order to get a
    point for a specific day, you need to first walk <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> steps (either upwards or
    downwards) in the staircase — thereafter you must register your
    achievement in the registration book at the registration
    desk.</p>
<p>While you would like to participate in the cup (the prizes
    are quite nice) you also don’t like walking on stairs that
    much, and would like to know the minimal number of steps you
    need to walk each day in order to get a point. You also plan to
    spend most of your day in your office, and you will enter and
    leave the building through the only entrance on the ground
    floor. There are no elevators and no underground floors in the
    building.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>One line with three numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq r \leq 1\, 000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq k \leq 1\, 000$</span>), respectively indicating the
    number of steps required before you can register, the number of
    steps from the ground floor to the registration desk, and the
    number of steps from the ground floor to the floor of your
    office.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The minimal number of staircase steps needed to participate
    in the staircase cup each day.</p>
