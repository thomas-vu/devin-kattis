<p>World Wide Flyer (WWF) has landing rights at several
    airports throughout the world. They wish to place their central
    hub at the airport that minimizes the maximum direct flying
    distance from the hub to any other airport in the world.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input file contains several sets of input. Each set consists
    of a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le
    1000$</span>, the number of airports. <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines follow, each giving the
    latitude (between <span class="tex2jax_process">$-90$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$+90$</span> degrees) and
    longitude (between <span class="tex2jax_process">$-180$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$+180$</span> degrees) of an
    airport. The input floating point numbers will not have more
    than two digits after the decimal point. Input is terminated by
    end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each set of input print the latitude and longitude of
    the airport that best serves as a hub in a single line. If
    there is more than one airport that best serves as a hub print
    the one that appears last in the input of the corresponding
    input set. Your output should always contain two digits after
    the decimal point.</p>
