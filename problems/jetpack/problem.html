<p>Little Mirko got a new mobile phone for his birthday! As all
    kids nowadays, he quickly downloaded all of the popular mobile
    games, including Jetpack Joyride.</p>
<p>In the game, the protagonist Barry is running across a field
    consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> rows
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> columns of squares
    of equal size. Initially, Barry is located in the center of the
    square in the lower left corner. Barry is constantly running to
    the right at the speed of one square per second. Additionally,
    he must avoid obstacles that are in his way.</p>
<p>When Mirko presses the phone screen, Barry turns on his
    super-duper special jetpack and starts his ascent at the speed
    of one square per second (still moving to the right, now moving
    diagonally up at an angle of <span class="tex2jax_process">$45^\circ $</span>, until he reaches the
    ceiling, when he will continue moving to the right until Mirko
    releases the screen). When Mirko releases the phone screen,
    Barry starts falling down at the speed of one square per second
    (now moving diagonally again, but this time facing down, until
    he reaches the floor, when he will continue moving to the
    right).</p>
<p>Mirko just started playing the game recently and he’s still
    not good at it. He saw on YouTube that someone managed to
    complete the game by crossing all <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> columns, so he is asking you for
    your help. He will give you the layout of the fields in the
    game, and you must output the moves he has to play in order to
    win.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 10^5$</span>), the size of the field. Each of the
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> lines
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> characters
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’ and ‘<tt class="ttfamily">X</tt>’, the layout of the field in the game. The
    characters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">X</tt>’ denote obstacles, and
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’ walkable fields.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first line of output must contain the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq P \leq 5\cdot 10^4$</span>), the
    number of moves Mirko has to make. In the following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> lines, output any
    series of <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> moves, each
    in its own line, such that it solves Mirko’s problem from the
    task. A move is determined by two <em>integers</em>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> denotes the second in which
    Mirko has to press the screen, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> denotes how long he needs to
    keep the screen pressed.</p>
<p>A series of moves must be sorted in chronological order. In
    other words, it must hold <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i +
    x_ i \leq t_{i+1}$</span>. Also, no move should begin after the
    end of the game, <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>
    &lt; <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. The input data
    will be such that a solution will surely exist.</p>
