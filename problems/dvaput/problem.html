<p>Ivana won the bet (Zvonko hadn’t foreseen this and suspects
    that it is due to outside interference) and now Zvonko is
    waiting for her at the movies. While he is waiting, he is
    observing messages on a screen above him.</p>
<p>As Ivana is running late, Zvonko has been looking at the
    screen for a while and noticed that some messages appeared on
    the screen more than once. Naturally, he’s been writing down
    all messages on a piece of paper. He wants to know the length
    of the longest string that appeared at least twice (appears in
    two different positions on the paper).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$L~ (1 \leq L \leq 200\, 000)$</span>, the
    length of the string Zvonko wrote down.</p>
<p>The second line contains a string of <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> lowercase letter of the English
    alphabet.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the length of the longest string that appears twice
    on a single line. If there is no such string, output zero.</p>
