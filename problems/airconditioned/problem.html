<div class="problembody">
<p>You are the boss of ACM (Air Conditioned Minions), an
    upstanding company with a single goal of world domination.</p>
<p>The company has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    minions. Each minion works evilly from early morning until
    evening inside a super secret bunker in Helsinki. After much
    deliberation, you decided to move your headquarters to
    Singapore. However, unlike Helsinki, Singapore is very hot, so
    the entire complex must be air conditioned. With strenuous
    working hours (under minimum wage too), it is imperative that
    all your minions work under optimal work condition. In
    particular, all minions must like the temperatures of the rooms
    they are in.</p>
<p>You are planning to construct several rooms in your new
    hideout, and assign your minions there. You fix the temperature
    of each room to any value you want (different rooms may have
    different temperatures). After you fix the temperatures, you
    will assign each of your minions to these rooms (a room can
    hold any number of minions). You want all minions to like the
    temperatures of their assigned rooms. Each minion likes an
    interval of temperature, and these preferences will be given to
    you.</p>
<p>Air conditioners are very expensive to maintain. Thus, you
    want to construct as few rooms as possible. What is the minimum
    number of rooms you need to set up such that it would be
    possible to assign minions to rooms as discussed earlier?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a non-negative integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 100$</span>, giving the number
    of minions in your company. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each describe the
    temperature preferences of all your minions. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line consists of two single
    space separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$U$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le L \le U \le 2N$</span>), which denotes that the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th minion likes any
    temperature between <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$U$</span>, inclusively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print an integer denoting the minimum number of rooms you
    need to construct.</p>
<h3>Sample Data Explanation</h3>
<p>In the first example, one of the possible solutions is to
    setup two rooms â€” one with temperature <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and another with temperature
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>. The first two minions
    can be assigned to the first room, while the third minion can
    be assigned to the second room.</p>
