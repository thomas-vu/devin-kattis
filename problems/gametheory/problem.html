      SoCCat the Game Theorist is a very tricky cat. Currently,
      SoCCat is challenging you to beat them in a game!
    </blockquote>
<p>SoCCat challenges you to the following game:</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cells
    arranged in a row, with numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> written on them. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th cell from the left has the
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> written on
    it. SoCCat also has another array <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>Before the game begins, SoCCat will place a token on the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>-th cell. Additionally,
    both of you will keep track of the score of the game, which is
    initially <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. SoCCat aims
    to <em>minimize</em> the score of the game, while you aim to
    <em>maximize</em> the score of the game. Note that the score of
    the game is shared between both of you.</p>
<p>You will then take turns moving the token. You will move the
    token first, and then SoCCat will move the token, and so on
    until the game ends. If the token is currently on the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-th cell, the current
    player performs the following action in order:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>First, increase the score of the game by <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ x$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, choose a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> which is a multiple of
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ x$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$x + k \leq
        n$</span>, move the token from the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-th cell to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x + k)$</span>-th cell. Otherwise, if
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x + k &gt; n$</span>, end
        the game.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, suppose <span class="tex2jax_process">$n =
    5$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p = [2, 1, 5, 3,
    4]$</span>. Before the game begins, SoCCat places the token on
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-st cell. In the
    first turn, you can pick <span class="tex2jax_process">$k \in
    \{ 2, 4, 6, \ldots \} $</span>. If you pick <span class="tex2jax_process">$k = 2$</span>, then the token will move from
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-st cell to the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-rd cell, and the score
    of the game will increase by <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1$</span>. In the second turn, SoCCat can
    pick <span class="tex2jax_process">$k \in \{ 5, 10, 15, \ldots
    \} $</span>. If SoCCat picks <span class="tex2jax_process">$k =
    10$</span>, then the score of the game will increase by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_3$</span>, and the game ends
    since <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 + 10 &gt; 5$</span>. The
    final score of this particular game is <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1 + a_3$</span>.</p>
<p>For each <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, assuming both of you play
    optimally, what is the final score of the game if SoCCat
    initially places the token on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>-th cell?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, denoting the number
    of test cases (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C \leq
    300\, 000$</span>). Each test case has the following
    format.</p>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of cells in the row
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 300\,
    000$</span>). The sum of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> over all test cases does not
    exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$300\, 000$</span>.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1, p_2, \ldots , p_ n$</span>, the
    integers written on the cells (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq p_ i \leq n$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i
    \neq p_ j$</span> if <span class="tex2jax_process">$i \neq
    j$</span>).</p>
<p>The third line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_ n$</span>, the
    integers in the array <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^9 \leq a_ i \leq
    10^9$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space-separated
    integers. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>-th
    integer denotes the final score of the game if SoCCat initially
    places the token on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>-th cell from the left, assuming
    both of you play optimally.</p>
