<div class="problembody">
<p>A growing rectangular spiral is a connected sequence of
    straight-line segments starting at the origin. The first
    segment goes right (positive <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> direction). The next segment goes
    up (positive <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>
    direction). The next segment goes left (negative <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> direction). The next segment goes
    down (negative <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>
    direction) and the sequence of directions repeats. Each segment
    has integer length and each segment is at least one unit longer
    than the previous segment. In the spiral below, the segment
    lengths are <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 9,
    11, 12, 15, 20$</span>.</p>

<p>Write a program to determine the shortest growing
    rectangular spiral (in total length) that ends at a given
    integer point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> in
    the first quadrant or determine that there is no such
    spiral.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 1000$</span>), which is the
    number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be
    processed identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input consisting
    of three space separated decimal integers. The first integer is
    the data set number. The next two integers are the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates of the desired end
    point (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le x \le 10000, 1 \le
    y \le 10000$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is a single line of output. If there
    is no spiral solution, the line consists of the data set
    number, a single space and “<tt class="ttfamily">NO PATH</tt>”
    (without the quotes). If there is a solution, the line consists
    of the data set number, a single space, the number of segments
    in the solution, a single space, followed by the lengths of the
    segments in order, separated by single spaces. The input data
    will be chosen so that no path requires more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$22$</span> segments.</p>
