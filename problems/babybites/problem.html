</div>Arild just turned <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> year old, and is currently
    learning how to count. His favorite thing to count is how many
    mouthfuls he has in a meal: every time he gets a bite, he will
    count it by saying the number out loud.
    <p>Unfortunately, talking while having a mouthful sometimes
    causes Arild to mumble incomprehensibly, making it hard to know
    how far he has counted. Sometimes you even suspect he loses his
    count! You decide to write a program to determine whether
    Arild’s counting makes sense or not.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>), the number of bites Arild receives.
    Then second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space-separated words spoken by
    Arild, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th of which
    is either a non-negative integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le a_ i \le 10\, 000$</span>) or the
    string “<tt class="ttfamily">mumble</tt>”.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If Arild’s counting might make sense, print the string
    “<tt class="ttfamily">makes sense</tt>”. Otherwise, print the
    string “<tt class="ttfamily">something is fishy</tt>”.</p>
