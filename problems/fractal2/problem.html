<p>Fractals are really cool mathematical objects. They have a
    lot of interesting properties, often including:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>fine structure at arbitrarily small scales;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>self-similarity, i.e., magnified it looks like a copy of
        itself;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a simple, recursive definition.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Approximate fractals are found a lot in nature, for example,
    in structures such as clouds, snow flakes, mountain ranges, and
    river networks.</p>

<p>In this problem, we consider fractals generated by the
    following algorithm: we start with a polyline, i.e., a set of
    connected line segments. This is what we call a fractal of
    depth one (see leftmost picture). To obtain a fractal of depth
    two, we replace each line segment with a scaled and rotated
    version of the original polyline (see middle picture). By
    repetitively replacing the line segments with the polyline, we
    obtain fractals of arbitrary depth and very fine structures
    arise. The rightmost picture shows a fractal of depth
    three.</p>
<p>The complexity of an approximate fractal increases quickly
    as its depth increases. We want to know where we end up after
    traversing a certain fraction of its length.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a single number <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \le c \le 200)$</span> on one line, the number of test cases.
    Then each test case starts with one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3\le n\le 100)$</span>, the number of
    points of the polyline. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines with on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th line two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(-1\, 000\le x_ i,y_ i\le 1\, 000)$</span>,
    the consecutive points of the polyline. Next follows one line
    with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\le d\le 10)$</span>, the
    depth of the fractal. Finally, there is one line with a
    floating point number <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$(0\le f\le 1)$</span>, the
    fraction of the length that is traversed.</p>
<p>The length of each line segment of the polyline is smaller
    than the distance between the first point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1,y_1)$</span> and the last point
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ n,y_ n)$</span> of the
    polyline. The length of the complete polyline is smaller than
    twice this distance.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case, the output contains one line with the
    coordinate where we end up. Format it as <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>Â <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, with two floating point numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>. The absolute error in both
    coordinates should be smaller than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
