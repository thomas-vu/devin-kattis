        Mario worlds
      </div>
</div>
<p>Mario and Luigi are speedrunning Super Mario Odyssey to
    determine who is the better speedrunner. In Super Mario
    Odyssey, there is a collection of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> worlds, where world <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> has <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> coins and takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> seconds to clear. If Mario or
    Luigi are the first to enter a world, then they will collect
    all <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> coins from it,
    leaving none for the other. If Mario and Luigi both enter the
    same world at the same time, there is a <span class="tex2jax_process">$50/50$</span> chance for who will receive
    all of the coins (in other words, Mario has a <span class="tex2jax_process">$50 \% $</span> chance of receiving all the
    coins, and Luigi does as well). Note that neither player knows
    which worlds have coins left at any moment. Once they enter a
    world, they must spend <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_
    i$</span> seconds clearing it regardless of whether it has
    coins.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Mario, Luigi’s planning was leaked and the
    ordering of worlds he will enter is known. That is, Luigi will
    begin with the first world on his list, then move to the next
    world, and so on. Knowing this, Mario is asking you for help to
    determine the optimal ordering of worlds to enter. Please
    determine which permutation of worlds to enter to maximize his
    chances of beating Luigi. Mario wins if he has strictly more
    coins than Luigi.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq N \leq 100,000)$</span>, representing the number of
    worlds. The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \dots , a_ N$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq a_ i \leq 10^9)$</span>,
    representing the number of coins in each world. The third line
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1,
    t_2, \dots , t_ N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq t_ i \leq 10^9)$</span>, representing the time it takes to
    clear each world. The fourth line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1, p_2, \dots , p_ N$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq t_ i \leq N)$</span>,
    representing Luigi’s ordering of worlds: Luigi will explore
    world <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1$</span> first, then
    world <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_2$</span>, and so on. It
    is guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is
    a permutation of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line consisting of a single double <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, the maximum chance for Mario to
    win. This probability should not exceed an absolute error of
    more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span>. On
    the next line, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    spaced integers, denoting the optimal permutation. If there is
    more than one correct permutation, then print any of them.</p>
