        A charging creeper! AWWW MANNNNN!
      </div>
</div>
<p>You need a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    different rare materials that can only be found in the deepest
    caves of the rarest biome at very specific times of the year.
    The materials are very important to you, so you want to make
    sure that nothing bad happens. Thus, you want to make a
    plan.<br/></p>
<p>For each material, you’ve picked out a day on which you’ll
    embark on the mining trip. Each day during this season is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> seconds long
    (surprisingly, the length of the days is different for
    different seasons), and the last <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> seconds of each day are dangerous,
    as the sun sets and some evil beings can spawn. Being a
    disciplined and organized person, you’ve also planned out the
    trip: you wake up at the <span class="tex2jax_process">$a^{th}$</span> second of the day (starts
    from 1) and start off the trip, you arrive in the cave and
    start looking for the material at the <span class="tex2jax_process">$b^{th}$</span> second of a day (this may or
    may not be the same day), and it takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> seconds for you to find and
    collect the material. After getting the material, you head back
    home along the same path, taking the same amount of time as
    when you came.<br/></p>
<p>Everything is perfectly planned out, except for one last
    detail to take care of: the last thing you want is to come home
    and accidentally run into a creeper and blow up your precious
    material–or even worse, blow up your house! Under the sun, you
    can see them clearly, so you know how to avoid them, but at
    night, you need to be very vigilant. Can you determine whether
    you’ll arrive home during the day or at night?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> , the number of
    different materials. (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T
    \leq 100\, 000$</span>)<br/>
    Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$2T$</span> lines
    describing the mining trips, with two lines per trip.<br/>
    The first line of each mining trip contains two space-separated
    integers: the number of seconds in a day <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 10^{18}$</span> and the length
    of nighttime <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M &lt; N
    $</span>.<br/>
    The second line of each mining trip contains three
    space-separated integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq a,b,d \leq N$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each mining trip, output one line containing “<tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt>” (without the quotes) if you will return
    during daytime and “<tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt>” (without the
    quotes) otherwise.</p>
