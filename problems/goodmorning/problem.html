<p><em>Good morning! This is your 5am wake-up call! A partly
    cloudy day is expected with light rain coming
    afternoon…</em></p>
<p>You have just woken up. You desperately need coffee… and…
    more coffee… and some cereal. And your clothes. And coffee.</p>
<p>To prepare warm cereal, you put some milk into a microwave,
    trying to heat it for <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    seconds. You must enter <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> on the microwave keyboard:</p>

<p>As you still haven’t had your coffee, your hand (along with
    eyes and brain) keeps falling down. You are only able to enter
    a number if your hand would only move downwards and/or to the
    right. You cannot go back left, nor move your hand up, though
    you can press the same key again. And again…and again…</p>
<p>For example, you can enter the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$180$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$49$</span>, but not <span class="tex2jax_process">$98$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$132$</span>. Enter a number that is as close
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> as possible. If
    there are two solutions, enter any one of them. You are too
    sleepy to actually care. And you need coffee.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the number of test cases
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 200$</span>). The descriptions
    of the test cases follow:</p>
<p>Each test case consists of one line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq 200$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a number that is closest to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> which can be entered
    on the keyboard.</p>
