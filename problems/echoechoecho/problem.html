<div class="problembody">
<p>If you have ever visited a canyon or a cave, you may have
    yelled and heard the echo of your own voice. In this problem,
    you should simulate that effect:</p>
<center>
      Hello! Hello! Hello!
    </center>
<p>Your program will be given as input a single word, and it
    should print out that word three times, separating the words
    with spaces.</p>
<p>As a refresher, here are some ways to read a single word
    from standard input (when the first line of input contains a
    single word), in a few different languages:</p>
<pre>
# Python 3
# input() reads a whole line, and strip() removes trailing whitespace/newline
word = input().strip()

// C++
// make sure to first "#include &lt;iostream&gt;"
std::string word;
std::cin &gt;&gt; word;

// Java
// make sure to first "import java.util.Scanner;"
Scanner s = new Scanner(System.in);
String word = s.next();
</pre>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input is a single line, containing exactly one word. The
    only characters used are upper and/or lowercase letters (aâ€“z).
    The word contains at least one and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the given word three times, separated by spaces.</p>
