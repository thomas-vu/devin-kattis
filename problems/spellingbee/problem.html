        An example of the Daily NY Times Spelling Bee Puzzle
      </div>
</div>
<p>The New York Times publishes a daily puzzle called the
    “Spelling Bee.” In this puzzle, <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> letters are shown in a hexagonal
    arrangement of <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> letters
    around a center letter. The task is to come up with as many
    words as possible that</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>contain only letters that are displayed in the
        hexagon,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>are at least of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>contain the center letter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A letter may be used more than once, and not all letters
    need to be used.</p>
<p>After playing for a while, you get stuck, but then you
    remind yourself that the Linux distribution on your computer
    comes with a machine-readable file of <span class="tex2jax_process">$102\, 305$</span> dictionary words in
    <tt class="ttfamily">/usr/share/dict/words</tt>!</p>
<p>You decide that even if you can’t excel at the Spelling Bee
    you can still excel at programming, so you decide to write a
    program that finds all solutions to a Spelling Bee puzzle from
    your dictionary.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case, which starts with
    a line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> distinct
    lowercase English letters. The first of these letters is the
    center letter. The next line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 102\, 305$</span>), the size of the dictionary. This
    line is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines, each containing a dictionary word of <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> lowercase English letters
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le l \le 24$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the word list matching the Spelling Bee puzzle in the
    order in which they appear in the dictionary. You are
    guaranteed that at least one dictionary entry will match.</p>
