        We assume that this will never happen again in Zürich.
        Photographer: Måns Magnusson
      </div>
</div>You are a very busy person, with a lot of important
    meetings. Today, you have a meeting for which it is insanely
    important to arrive at the agreed time.

    <p>Luckily you live in Zürich, which features a large network
    of extremely punctual trams. Each tram line travels from one
    place to another at regular intervals, always taking the same
    time from departure to arrival. It is very easy to change
    trams, and we assume that it takes no time to change to another
    tram if both are at a stop at the same time. This means that if
    a tram arrives at its destination at exactly time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> and another tram departs from the
    same place at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (or
    later), you will have enough time to change tram.</p>
<p>You are currently working in your hotel room before the
    meeting. Since you are a very busy person, you would like to
    leave your hotel at the latest possible time possible while
    still ariving to the meeting on time. When do you need to leave
    for your meeting?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le n \leq 100\, 000$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \leq 200\,
        000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le s \leq
        10^9$</span>), the number of tram stops, the number of tram
        lines, and the time at which the meeting starts in seconds
        relative to now.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each
        with five integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u, v,
        t_0, p, d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le u
        \not= v &lt; n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
        \le t_0 \le 10^9$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
        \le p, d \le 10^9$</span>). The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th line describes the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th tram line,
        which departs from tram stop <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>, arrives at tram stop
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>, starts its first
        departure <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_0$</span>
        seconds from now, departs every <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> seconds from the first
        departure, and takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> seconds from departure to
        arrival.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The stops are numbered between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n - 1$</span>. Your hotel is located at stop
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, and the meeting is at
    stop <span class="tex2jax_process">$n - 1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the latest time at which you can leave the hotel
    while arriving to your meeting on time, in seconds from now. If
    you can not make it to your meeting on time, output <tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt> instead.</p>
