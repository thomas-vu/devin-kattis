<p>Our favorite Onid Pizza would like to have a commercial
    aired in a radio. Since they are close to KTH, they want to
    attract mainly students. It’s not a good idea to have the
    commercial aired between 8 am and 5 pm, because most of the
    students are in the school and don’t listen to the radio. Onid
    made a survey and now they know how many students listen to the
    radio at each point of the day.</p>
<p>They also know that if each student listens to a commercial,
    he or she will spend one Swedish crown on pizza in expectation.
    Thus if 100 students listen to a commercial, Onid will increase
    their income by 100 crowns on average from selling more
    pizza.</p>
<p>Of course, Onid Pizza has to pay a fixed amount every time
    the commercial is played. The radio has a commercial break
    every 15 minutes. Unfortunately, Onid can choose only one
    continuous sequence of commercial breaks, for example all
    breaks from 5 pm to 8 pm. Help them to choose a continuous
    sequence of commercial breaks such that their profit is
    maximal.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two space separated
    positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N, P$</span> –
    the total number of commercial breaks in a day and the price of
    one commercial break. You can assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \le 100\, 000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$P \le 1\, 000$</span>. On the next line
    there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    space-separated integers – the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th integer denotes how many
    students listen to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th commercial break. There are
    always at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000$</span>
    students listening.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output contains one line with one integer – the biggest
    expected extra profit Onid can get by selecting a continuous
    sequence of commercial breaks.</p>
