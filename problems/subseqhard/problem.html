<p>“<span class="tex2jax_process">$47$</span> is the
    quintessential random number," states the <span class="tex2jax_process">$47$</span> society. And there might be a
    grain of truth in that.</p>
<p>For example, the first ten digits of the Euler’s constant
    are:</p>
<pre>
2 7 1 8 2 8 1 8 2 8
</pre>
<p>And what’s their sum? Of course, it is <span class="tex2jax_process">$47$</span>.</p>
<p>Try walking around with your eyes open. You may be sure that
    soon you will start discovering occurrences of the number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$47$</span> everywhere.</p>
<p>You are given a sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> of integers we saw somewhere in
    the nature. Your task will be to compute how strongly does this
    sequence support the above claims. We will call a continuous
    subsequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>
<em>interesting</em> if the sum of its terms is equal to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$47$</span>.</p>
<p>E.g., consider the sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$S
    = (24, 17, 23, 24, 5, 47)$</span>. Here we have two interesting
    continuous subsequences: the sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$(23, 24)$</span> and the sequence
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(47)$</span>.</p>
<p>Given a sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>,
    find the count of its interesting subsequences.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input file contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> specifying the number
    of test cases. There are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> test cases and each test case is
    preceded by a blank line.</p>
<p>The first line of each test case contains the length of a
    sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \leq 1\, 000\, 000$</span>. The second
    line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    space-separated integers – the elements of the sequence. All
    numbers don’t exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$20\,
    000$</span> in absolute value.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case output a single line containing a single
    integer – the count of interesting subsequences of the given
    sentence.</p>
