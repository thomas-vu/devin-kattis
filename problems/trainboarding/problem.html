<div class="problembody">
<p>Punctual City is well known for the punctuality of its
    citizens and its public transportation system. It is
    particularly famous for its train system. It is always on time,
    and never too late (or even too early). Statistics about train
    boarding is regularly collected to keep things running
    smoothly.</p>
<p>A train has cars numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (from front to back), each of
    length <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> meters. Each
    car has exactly one door for boarding located at the center
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$L/2$</span> meters from each
    end of the car). There are no gaps between cars.</p>
<p>When the train stops at the boarding platform, each
    passenger waiting for the train walks to the door of the car
    which is closest to them, taking the higher numbered car in the
    case of a tie.</p>
<p>Given the location of the passengers relative to the train,
    help the city by reporting the longest distance that any
    passenger has to walk and the maximum number of passengers
    boarding any single car.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 100$</span>), which is the number of cars of the
    train, <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq L \leq 100$</span>), which is the
    length of each car, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq P \leq 1\, 000$</span>), which is the number of passengers
    waiting for the train. It is guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> is an even number.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> lines
    describe the location of the passengers relative to the train.
    Each line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq x \leq 10\, 000$</span>), which is the distance the
    passenger is behind the front-end of the train.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the longest distance that any passenger has to walk
    on one line. On the next line, display the maximum number of
    passengers boarding any single car.</p>
