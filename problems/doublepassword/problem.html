<p>A computer at ICPC headquarters is protected by a four-digit
    password—in order to log in, you normally need to guess the
    four digits exactly. However, the programmer who implemented
    the password check left a backdoor in the computer—there is a
    second four-digit password. If the programmer enters a
    four-digit sequence, and for each digit position the digit
    entered matches at least one of the two passwords in that same
    position, then that four-digit sequence will log the programmer
    into the computer.</p>
<p>Given the two passwords, count the number of distinct
    four-digit sequences that can be entered to log into the
    computer.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of exactly two lines. Each of the two
    lines contains a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$|s|~ =~ 4$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s~ \in ~ \{ \texttt{0-9}\} ^*$</span>).
    These are the two passwords.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the number of distinct
    four-digit sequences that will log the programmer into the
    system.</p>
