<p>Olivia runs a very famous and profitable smoothie stand. On
    any given day, she will always sell out (that is, she will sell
    as many smoothies as she has ingredients to make), regardless
    of what smoothie recipe she offers. Therefore, to simplify
    things, she has decided she will only make one type of smoothie
    per day. Now she has come to you to help her decide which of
    her recipes she should use today, given the ingredients she has
    on hand and the sale price of each type of smoothie.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, separated by a space. The value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is the number of
    different ingredients Olivia uses in her smoothies and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is the number of
    different recipes she makes. You may assume <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq k\leq 100\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq r\leq 100\, 000$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq kr\leq 100\, 000$</span>.
    The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> integers, which represent the
    amount of each ingredient she currently has on hand. This is
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines,
    each of which represents a recipe. On each such line, the first
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> space-separated
    integers represent the amount of each ingredient used in that
    recipe. This is followed by one integer representing the price
    charged for one smoothie of that recipe.</p>
<p>You may assume that all values, except possibly <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, are nonnegative integers less
    than or equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^4$</span>.
    It is guaranteed that each recipe uses at least one
    ingredient.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the largest total sales revenue that can be obtained
    by choosing a single recipe and making as many of that recipe
    as possible.</p>
