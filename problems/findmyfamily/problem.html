<p>You are looking for a particular family photo with you and
    your favorite relatives Alice and Bob. Each family photo
    contains a line-up of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    people. On the photo you’re looking for, you remember that
    Alice, who is taller than you, was somewhere on your left from
    the perspective of the photographer. Also, Bob who is taller
    than both you and Alice, was standing somewhere on your
    right.</p>
<p>Since you have a large number of family photos, you want to
    use your computer to assist in finding the photo. Many of the
    photos are quite blurry, so facial recognition has proven
    ineffective. Luckily, the Batch Apex Photo Classifier, which
    detects each person in a photo and outputs the sequence of
    their (distinct) heights in pixels, has produced excellent
    results. Given this sequence of heights for <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> photos, determine which of these
    photos could potentially be the photo you’re looking for.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq k\leq 1\, 000$</span>, the number
        of photos you have to process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then follow two lines for each photo.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains a single integer
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq n \leq 3\cdot
            10^5$</span>, the number of people on this photo.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> distinct integers
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq h_1, \dots , h_ n
            \leq 10^9$</span>, the heights of the people in the
            photo, from left to right.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is guaranteed that the total number of people in all
    photos is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\cdot
    10^5$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>On the first line, output the number of photos
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> that need further
        investigation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then print <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
        lines each containing a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq a_ i \leq n$</span>, the sorted
        indices of the photos you need to look at.</p>
</li>
