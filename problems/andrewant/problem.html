<p>Andrew the Ant is fascinated by the behavior of his friends.
    Thousands of them are marching their paths on and on. They can
    build highly organized ant-hills. Sometimes, however, they act
    a little bit stupidly.</p>
<p>Recently, Andrew watched his fellow ants marching on top of
    a long piece of wood. He noticed their behavioral pattern is
    very simple: Each ant walks slowly forward with a constant
    speed of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, \mathrm{cm}$</span>
    per second. Whenever it meets another ant, both of them only
    touch with their antennae and immediately turn around and walk
    the opposite direction. If an ant comes to the end of the wood,
    it falls down and does not affect other ants anymore.</p>

<p>Your task is to simulate the movement of ants. For
    simplicity, suppose that the ants have zero size (although the
    picture could suggest something else).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several scenarios, at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>. Each scenario starts
    with a line containing two integer numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, separated by a space.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> is the length of the
    wood in centimetres (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq L
    \leq 99\, 999$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> is the number of ants at the
    beginning of the simulation (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq A \leq L + 1$</span>). Then there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> lines, each containing a
    non-negative integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_
    i$</span>, one space, and an uppercase letter. The number
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq X_ i \leq L$</span>)
    specifies the position of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th ant and the letter its initial
    direction: either “<tt class="ttfamily">L</tt>” for left
    (towards zero) or “<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>” for right. No
    two ants will start at the same position.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each scenario, you should print a single line containing
    the text “<tt class="ttfamily">The last ant will fall down in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> seconds - started at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>.</tt>”, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> is the exact time when
    the last ant (or two) reaches the end of the wood, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is the position where
    that particular ant has originally started in time <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. If two last ants fall down at the
    same time, print “<tt class="ttfamily">started at <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span></tt>”, indicating both of their
    positions, <span class="tex2jax_process">$P &lt; Q$</span>.</p>
