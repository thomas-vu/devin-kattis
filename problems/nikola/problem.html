<div class="problembody">
<p>Against his own will, Nikola has become the main character
    in a game. The game is played on a row of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> squares, numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. Nikola is initially in square
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and can jump to other
    squares. Nikola’s first jump must be to square <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>. Each subsequent jump must satisfy
    two constraints:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If the jump is in the forward direction, it must be one
        square longer than the preceding jump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the jump is in the backward direction, it must be
        exactly the same length as the preceding jump.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, after the first jump (when on square 2), Nikola
    can jump back to square 1 or forwards to square 4. For
    instance, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$N = 6$</span> (see
    first example case below), one possible way to reach
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> would be by using the
    squares 1-2-1-3-6.</p>
<p>Every time he enters a square, Nikola must pay an <b class="bfseries">entry fee</b>. Nikola’s goal is to get from square
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to square <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <b class="bfseries">as cheaply as
    possible</b>. Write a program that determines the smallest
    total cost for Nikola to get to square <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 1000$</span>, the number of squares. Each of the
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contains the entry fee for one square, a positive integer less
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span>. The entry fees
    will be given in order for squares <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the smallest total cost for Nikola to get to square
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
