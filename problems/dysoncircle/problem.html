<div class="problembody">
<p>A Dyson Sphere is a theoretical construction around the sun
    or another star, that captures the entire energy output of the
    star. Science fiction writers have speculated that advanced
    civilizations will eventually build such a sphere, as the
    energy demands of such a society continue to grow without
    bounds. In our three-dimensional space, Dyson spheres are still
    in the realm of fiction. <em>Dy &amp; Son</em>, the
    main energy company of your dimensional neighbours, has tasked
    you with carrying out a feasibility study in the
    two-dimensional world of Flatland.</p>
<p>Dy &amp; Son has developed a modular Dyson Circle.
    It consists of independent square Dyson Units that can chain
    together to form a closed loop that gathers energy. Your task
    is to figure out how many of these Dyson units they actually
    need to enclose the star or stars they are interested in. Note
    that they want a single Dyson Circle, not a separate one for
    each star.</p>
<p>For convenience, both the stars Dy &amp; Son wants
    to enclose and the Dyson Units used for this are modeled as
    squares of exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> <em>Intergalactic
    Unit</em>, aligned to the <em>Intergalactic Coordinate
    System</em>. Your Dyson units connect if they have at least a
    corner in common. See Figure 1 for an example.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: Illustration of Sample Input 1: four
          stars (yellow squares) and an optimal Dyson Circle
          (dashed blue squares) surrounding them, and the remaining
          blackness of space shown in white.

<p>Formally, select some squares in the plane to turn into
    Dyson Units, such that the remaining squares can be split into
    <em>inside</em> and <em>outside</em> squares. All the stars
    must be inside squares. The inside squares must form a
    contiguous region (connected via edges) and not connect to the
    outside squares (via edges). The outside squares form a
    contiguous region stretching off to infinity.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$</span>), the
        number of stars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^6 \leq x, y \leq 10^6$</span>), the
        location of the center of a star.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No two stars are at the same location.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the least number of Dyson units required to capture
    the energy of all stars in the input.</p>
