<p>It is finally Bobbyâ€™s birthday, and all of his
    Acquaintances, Buddies and Colleagues have gathered for a board
    game night. They are going to play a board game which is played
    in up to three big teams. Bobby decided to split his guests
    into groups based on how well he knows them: the Acquaintances
    on team <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, the Buddies
    on team <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, and the
    Colleagues on team <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>.</p>
<p>While Bobby was busy explaining the rules to everyone, all
    his guests already took seats around his large, circular living
    room table. However, for the game it is crucial that all people
    sitting on a team are sitting next to each other. Otherwise,
    members of other teams could easily eavesdrop on their
    planning, ruining the game. So some people may need to change
    seats to avoid this from happening.</p>
<p>Bobby wants to start playing the game as soon as possible,
    so he wants people to switch seats as efficiently as possible.
    Given the current arrangement around the circular table, can
    you figure out the minimal number of people that must switch
    seats so that the teams are lined up correctly?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line of the input contains the integer
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$</span>
        is the number of players (as well as seats).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second line contains a string of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, consisting only of the
        characters in <tt class="ttfamily">ABC</tt>. This indicates
        the teams of the people sitting around the table in
        order.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single integer: the minimal number of people you
    have to ask to move seats to make sure the teams sit
    together.</p>
