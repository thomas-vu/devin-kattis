<div class="problembody">
<p>Princess Perly has been kidnapped by the magical Hydra! The
    kingdom is in chaos. Now only PyPy — the bravest Knight of the
    country — can save the day!</p>
<p>Hydra is a powerful magical creature with <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> heads and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> tails. Hydra can breathe fire from
    each of its heads, and can shoot poison from each of its tails.
    The only way to kill Hydra is to cut off all <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> heads and all <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> tails. Please note that a Hydra
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> heads and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T &gt; 0$</span> tails is still
    alive — in which case it is called a ‘Headless Hydra’.</p>
<p>Knight PyPy is indeed brave, but the Knight is still a
    novice when it comes to fighting magical creatures. Knight PyPy
    only know <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> moves:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>With the first move, Knight PyPy can cut off exactly one
        of Hydra’s heads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the second move, Knight PyPy can cut off exactly
        one of Hydra’s tails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the third move, Knight PyPy can cut off exactly two
        of Hydra’s heads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the fourth move, Knight PyPy can cut off exactly
        two of Hydra’s tails.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please remember that even though Hydra is a magical
    creature, the number of its heads and tails can never be
    negative. Thus PyPy cannot use a move when there are not enough
    heads or tails; e.g. PyPy cannot use the first move on a
    Headless Hydra.</p>
<p>However, Hydra is not so easy to kill. Immediately after
    PyPy’s move,</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If PyPy cuts off exactly one head, a new head grows
        immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If PyPy cuts off exactly one tail, two new tails grow
        immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If PyPy cuts off exactly two tails, a new head grows
        immediately.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If PyPy cuts off exactly two heads, nothing happens.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that if after PyPy’s move Hydra has <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> heads and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> tails, new heads and tails can
    still grow, in which case the Hydra is still alive.</p>
<p>Knight PyPy wants to kill Hydra as soon as possible, so that
    he can save Princess Perly. What is the minimum number of moves
    that PyPy needs to use to kill Hydra?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> test cases. Each test case
    contains exactly one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \le H, T \le 100)$</span>.</p>
<p>The input is terminated by a single line containing two
    zeros.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print exactly one line containing a
    single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If it is impossible to kill Hydra, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S = -1$</span>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is
        the minimum number of moves to kill Hydra.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Explanation of example</h2>
<p>In this test case, Hydra has <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> heads and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> tails initially. Following is a
    possible strategy for PyPy, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> moves:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Use the fourth move. Hydra now has <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> heads and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> tail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the third move. Hydra now has <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> heads and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> tail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the third move. Hydra now has <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> heads and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> tail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the second move. Hydra now has <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> heads and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> tails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the second move. Hydra now has <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> heads and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> tails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the second move. Hydra now has <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> heads and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> tails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the fourth move. Hydra now has <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> head and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> tails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the fourth move. Hydra now has <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> heads and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> tails.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the third move. Hydra now has <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> heads and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> tails. Because PyPy cuts of
        exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> heads, no
        new head nor tail grow, and Hydra is dead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Thus PyPy can kill Hydra with <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> moves. This is also the minimum
    number of moves for this test case.</p>
