<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Your program should take as input a single TSP instance. It
    will be run several times, once for every test case. The time
    limit is per test case.</p>
<p>The first line of standard input contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 1000$</span>, the
    number of points. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each contain a pair of real
    numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x, y$</span> giving the
    coordinates of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    points. All numbers in the input have absolute value bounded by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{6}$</span>.</p>
<p>The distance between two points is computed as the Euclidean
    distance between the two points, <em>rounded to the nearest
    integer</em>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Standard output should consist of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th of which should contain the
    (0-based) index of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th point visited.</p>
<h2>Score</h2>
<p>Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text{Opt}$</span> be the
    length of an optimal tour, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text{Val}$</span> be the length of the tour
    found by your solution, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text{Naive}$</span> be the length of the
    tour found by the algorithm below. Define <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = (\text{Val} - \text{Opt}) /
    (\text{Naive} - \text{Opt})$</span>. (In the special case that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text{Naive} =
    \text{Opt}$</span>, define <span class="tex2jax_process">$x =
    0$</span> if <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text{Val} =
    \text{Opt}$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x =
    \infty $</span> if <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text{Val}
    &gt; \text{Opt}$</span>.)</p>
<p>The score on a test case is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.02^{x}$</span>. Thus, if your tour is
    optimal, you will get <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    point on this test case. If your score is halfway between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text{Naive}$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text{Opt}$</span>, you get
    roughly <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.14$</span> points. The
    total score of your submission is the sum of your score over
    all test cases. There will be a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> test cases. Thus, an
    implementation of the algorithm below should give a score of at
    least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> (it will get
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.02$</span> points on most test
    cases, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1.0$</span> points on
    some easy cases where it manages to find an optimal
    solution).</p>
<p>The algorithm giving the value <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text{Naive}$</span> is as follows:</p>
<pre>
GreedyTour
   tour[0] = 0
   used[0] = true
   for i = 1 to n-1
      best = -1
      for j = 0 to n-1
         if not used[j] and (best = -1 or dist(tour[i-1],j) &lt; dist(tour[i-1],best))
            best = j
      tour[i] = best
      used[best] = true
   return tour
</pre>
<p>The sample output gives the tour found by <tt class="ttfamily">GreedyTour</tt> on the sample input. The length of
    the tour is 323.</p>
