<p>Educators are always coming up with new ways to teach math
    to students. In 2011, an educational software company, All
    Computer Math (ACM), developed an application to display
    products in a traditional grade school math format. ACM is now
    working on an updated version of the software that will display
    results in a lattice format that some students find to be
    easier when multiplying larger numbers.</p>
<p>An example would be when multiplying <span class="tex2jax_process">$345 \cdot 56 = 19320$</span> as given below,
    using a lattice grid with 2 rows and 3 columns, which appears
    inside a surrounding frame:</p>
<pre>
+---------------+
|   3   4   5   |
| +---+---+---+ |
| |1 /|2 /|2 /| |
| | / | / | / |5|
|1|/ 5|/ 0|/ 5| |
| +---+---+---+ |
|/|1 /|2 /|3 /| |
| | / | / | / |6|
|9|/ 8|/ 4|/ 0| |
| +---+---+---+ |
|/ 3 / 2 / 0    |
+---------------+
</pre>
<p>The first operand, 345, is displayed above the top of the
    grid with each digit centered horizontally above its column of
    the grid, and the second operand, 56, is displayed along the
    righthand side with each digit centered vertically at the
    center of its row in the grid. A single cell of the grid, such
    as</p>
<pre>
          +---+
          |3 /|
          | / |
          |/ 0|
          +---+
</pre>
<p>represents the product of the digit of the first operand
    that is above its column and the digit of the second operand
    that is to the right of its row. In our example, this cell
    represents the product 5 times 6 = 30 that results when
    multiplying the 5 in 345 and the 6 in 56. Note that the 10’s
    digit of that product is placed in the upper left portion of
    this cell and the 1’s digit in the lower right.</p>
<p>The overall product is then computed by summing along the
    diagonals in the lattice that represent the same place values
    in the result. For example, in our first problem the product
    19320 was computed as:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" class="tabular">
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>1’s digit</p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>= <b class="bfseries">0</b></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>10’s digit</p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>= 5 + 3 + 4 = 12, thus <b class="bfseries">2</b> with
          a carry of 1</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>100’s digit</p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>= (1 carry) + 2 + 0 + 2 + 8 = 13, thus <b class="bfseries">3</b> with a carry of 1</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>1000’s digit</p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>= (1 carry) + 2 + 5 + 1 = <b class="bfseries">9</b></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>10000’s digit</p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>= <b class="bfseries">1</b></p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The resulting product is placed with the one’s digit below
    the grid at the far right and, depending on its length, with
    the most significant digits wrapped around the left side of the
    grid. Each digit of the final product appears perfectly aligned
    with the corresponding diagonal summands.</p>
<p>To provide an aesthetic view, we use a series of minus
    (<tt class="ttfamily">-</tt>) characters for horizontal lines,
    pipe (<tt class="ttfamily">|</tt>) characters for vertical
    lines, and slash (<tt class="ttfamily">/</tt>) characters for
    diagonal lines. Furthermore, we use a plus (<tt class="ttfamily">+</tt>) character wherever a horizontal and vertical
    line meet. Each multiplication lattice is subsequently "boxed"
    by an outer border. There is a row containing the first operand
    which is between the topmost border and the top line of the
    grid, and a row between the bottom of the grid and the bottom
    border, which contains some portion of the resulting product.
    There is one column between the leading | and the left edge of
    the inner grid, which may contain a portion of the resulting
    product, and one column after the right edge of the inner grid
    but before the rightmost | border, which contains the second
    operand. If the product is not long enough to wrap around the
    bottom-left corner, the column between the left border and the
    left edge of the grid will containing only spaces. (See the
    later example of 3 x 3.)</p>
<p>Leading zeros should be displayed within lattice grid cells,
    but leading zeros should never be displayed in the product, nor
    should there ever be a slash (<tt class="ttfamily">/</tt>)
    character prior to the leading digit of the product. For
    example, consider the product of <span class="tex2jax_process">$12 \cdot 27 = 324$</span> below:</p>
<pre>
+-----------+
|   1   2   |
| +---+---+ |
| |0 /|0 /| |
| | / | / |2|
| |/ 2|/ 4| |
| +---+---+ |
| |0 /|1 /| |
| | / | / |7|
|3|/ 7|/ 4| |
| +---+---+ |
|/ 2 / 4    |
+-----------+
</pre>
<p>Note that in the top-right grid of the lattice, the product
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \cdot 2 = 04$</span> is
    displayed with the zero for the tens digit. However, there is
    no thousands digit displayed in the product 324, nor is there
    any slash displayed above the digit 3 in that product.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is composed of <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leqslant T \leqslant 20$</span>).</p>
<p>Each test contains two positive integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leqslant A \leqslant 9999$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leqslant B \leqslant
    9999$</span>.</p>
<p>The last test case will be followed by a line containing
    <tt class="ttfamily">0 0</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, produce the grid that illustrates how to
    multiply the two numbers using the lattice multiplication
    technique.</p>
