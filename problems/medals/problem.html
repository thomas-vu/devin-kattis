</div>At the Olympic Games, countries are ranked according to
    the number of medals their athletes won. However, there is more
    than one possible way of ranking countries by their medals. In
    Europe, for example, countries are first ranked by the number
    of gold medals their athletes won. Ties are broken by looking
    at silver medals, and then at bronze medals. In Canada,
    however, because Canadian athletes do not win very many gold
    medals, countries are ranked by the overall number of medals
    won, giving the same weight to gold, silver, and bronze medals.

    <p>In general, a ranking scheme can be thought of as a vector
    of positive weights. This vector is multiplied with the vector
    of medals won by each country, and the scalar product of the
    two vectors defines the score of the respective country, which
    is then used to produce the ranking. In this general scheme,
    the European ranking technique corresponds to the weight vector
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(10^{20}, 10^{10}, 1)$</span>,
    whereas the Canadian method corresponds to the vector
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 1, 1)$</span>.</p>
<p>In this problem, you will only need to consider weight
    vectors of the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1/n^ j,
    1/n^ k, 1/n^ l)$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the total number of medals won
    by all athletes in the Olympic Games, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> are integers.</p>
<p>Given a list of countries and the number of gold, silver,
    and bronze medals won by each country, print the line</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<tt class="ttfamily">Canada wins!</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>if there is a weight vector of the above form such that
    Canada ranks first (possibly tied with one or more other
    countries) according to the ranking scheme defined by that
    vector. Print the line</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<tt class="ttfamily">Canada cannot win.</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>if no such vector exists.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains multiple test cases. Each test case
    starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, the number of countries to
    follow. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> lines contains the name of a
    country and three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> â€“ the number of gold, silver, and
    bronze medals won by the country. The last test case has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c = 0$</span> and must not be
    processed. It is guaranteed that each test case contains at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> different
    countries and that the total number of medals smaller than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>. Country names do
    not contain whitespace characters.</p>
