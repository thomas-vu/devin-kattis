<p>To save money, Santa Claus has started hiring other animals
    besides reindeer to pull his sleigh via short term ‘gig’
    contracts. As a result, the actual animals that show up to pull
    his sleigh for any given trip can vary greatly in size.</p>
<p>Last week he had <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    buffalo, <span class="tex2jax_process">$37$</span> voles and a
    schnauzer. Unfortunately, both buffalo were hitched on the left
    side and the entire sleigh flipped over in mid-flight due to
    the weight imbalance.</p>
<p>To prevent such accidents in the future, Santa needs to
    divide the animals for a given trip into two groups such that
    the sum of the weights of all animals in one group equals the
    sum of the weights of all animals in the other. To make the
    hitching process efficient, Santa is seeking an integer target
    weight <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> such that all
    animals that are lighter than <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> go in one group and those heavier
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> go into the
    other. If there are multiple such <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, he wants the smallest one.
    There’s one small wrinkle: what should be done if there some
    animals have weight exactly equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>? Santa solves the problem this
    way: if there are an even number of such animals, he divides
    them equally among the two groups (thus distributing the weight
    evenly). But if there are an odd number of such animals, then
    one of those animals is sent to work with the elves to make
    toys (it is not put in either group), and the remaining (now an
    even number) are divided evenly among the two groups.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input describes a list of animals’ weights. The first line
    contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le m \le 10^5$</span>),
    indicating the number of animals. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each have a positive
    integer. These are the weights of the animals (in ounces).
    Animals weighing more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$20\,
    000$</span> ounces are too big to pull the sleigh so no given
    weight exceeds this maximum.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the smallest integer target weight <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, as described above. It’s
    guaranteed that it is possible to find such an integer.</p>
