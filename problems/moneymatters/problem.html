<div class="problembody">
<p>Our sad tale begins with a tight clique of friends. Together
    they went on a trip to the picturesque country of Molvania.
    During their stay, various events which are too horrible to
    mention occurred. The net result was that the last evening of
    the trip ended with a momentous exchange of “I never want to
    see you again!”s. A quick calculation tells you it may have
    been said almost <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>
    million times!</p>
<p>Back home in Scandinavia, our group of ex-friends realize
    that they haven’t split the costs incurred during the trip
    evenly. Some people may be out several thousand crowns.
    Settling the debts turns out to be a bit more problematic than
    it ought to be, as many in the group no longer wish to speak to
    one another, and even less to give each other money.</p>
<p>Naturally, you want to help out, so you ask each person to
    tell you how much money she owes or is owed, and whom she is
    still friends with. Given this information, you’re sure you can
    figure out if it’s possible for everyone to get even, and with
    money only being given between persons who are still
    friends.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n \leq 10\, 000$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le m \leq 50\, 000$</span>), the number of friends and the
    number of remaining friendships. The friends are named
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0, 1, \ldots , n-1$</span>. Then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines follow, each
    containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$o$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\, 000 \le o \le 10\,
    000)$</span> indicating how much each person owes (or is owed
    if <span class="tex2jax_process">$o &lt;0$</span>). The first
    of those lines gives the balance of person <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, the second line the balance of
    person <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and so on. The
    sum of these values is zero.</p>
<p>After this comes <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines giving the remaining friendships, each line containing
    two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x &lt; y \le n-1$</span>) indicating
    that persons <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> are still friends.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Your output should consist of a single line saying
    “<tt class="ttfamily">POSSIBLE</tt>” or “<tt class="ttfamily">IMPOSSIBLE</tt>”.</p>
