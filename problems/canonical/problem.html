<p>A <em>coin system</em> <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is a finite (nonempty) set of
    distinct positive integers corresponding to coin values, also
    called <em>denominations</em>, in a real or imagined monetary
    system. For example, the coin system in common use in Canada is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1,5,10,25,100,200\} $</span>,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> corresponds to a
    <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-cent</span> coin and <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> corresponds to a <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span>-cent</span> <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>-dollar)</span> coin. For any coin
    system <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, we assume that
    there is an unlimited supply of coins of each denomination, and
    we also assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, since this
    guarantees that any positive integer can be written as a sum of
    (possibly repeated) values in <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>.</p>
<p>Cashiers all over the world face (and solve) the following
    problem: For a given coin system and a positive integer amount
    owed to a customer, what is the smallest number of coins
    required to dispense exactly that amount? For example, suppose
    a cashier in Canada owes a customer <span class="tex2jax_process">$83$</span> cents. One possible solution is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$25+25+10+10+10+1+1+1$</span>,
    i.e., <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> coins, but this
    is not optimal, since the cashier could instead dispense
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$25+25+25+5+1+1+1$</span>, i.e.,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> coins (which
    <em>is</em> optimal in this case). Fortunately, the Canadian
    coin system has the nice property that the <em>greedy
    algorithm</em> always yields an optimal solution, as do the
    coin systems used in most countries. The greedy algorithm
    involves repeatedly choosing a coin of the largest denomination
    that is less than or equal to the amount still owed, until the
    amount owed reaches zero. A coin system for which the greedy
    algorithm is always optimal is called <em>canonical</em>.</p>
<p>Your challenge is this: Given a coin system <span class="tex2jax_process">$S = \{ c_1, c_2, \ldots , c_ n\} $</span>,
    determine whether <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is
    canonical or non-canonical. Note that if <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is non-canonical then there exists
    at least one <em>counterexample</em>, i.e., a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> such that the minimum
    number of coins required to dispense exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is less than the number of coins
    used by the greedy algorithm. An example of a non-canonical
    coin system is <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1,3,4\}
    $</span>, for which <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> is
    a counterexample, since the greedy algorithm yields
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4+1+1$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> coins), but an optimal solution is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3+3$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> coins). A useful fact (due to
    Dexter Kozen and Shmuel Zaks) is that if <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is non-canonical, then the
    smallest counterexample is less than the sum of the two largest
    denominations.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single case. The first line contains an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2 \leq n \leq 100)$</span>, the number of
    denominations in the coin system. The next line contains the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> denominations as
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1 \
    c_2 \ \ldots \ c_ n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1 = 1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1 &lt; c_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; c_ n \leq
    10^6$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “<tt class="ttfamily">canonical</tt>” if the coin
    system is canonical, or “<tt class="ttfamily">non-canonical</tt>” if the coin system is
    non-canonical.</p>
