<p>‘Hunter’: a licensed profession for those who specialize in
    finding rare creatures or secret treasures.</p>
<p>Gon has embarked on a new journey to become a Hunter.
    Yesterday, Gon arrived in Hanoi to participate in the Hunter
    Exam — an annual exam which an applicant must pass, in
    order to become a Hunter.</p>
<p>The Hunter Examination Hall is surrounded by a circular
    road. We can model the road as <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> concentric circles, numbered from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> from the outermost circle to the
    innermost circle. The circles are each divided into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> arcs, numbered from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> in clockwise order. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th arc in the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th circle is denoted
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i, j)$</span>. Gon is
    currently standing at arc <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,
    1)$</span>. The following image contains a circular road with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C = 3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$A = 8$</span>.</p>

</center>
<p>There are motorbikes on the road. There is at most one
    motorbike in each arc, and there is no motorbike in arc
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 1)$</span>. In the above
    image, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    motorbikes, one at arc <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,
    2)$</span> and another at arc <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 7)$</span>.</p>
<p>All the motorbikes are travelling at constant speed of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> arc per second, in
    clockwise direction, without stopping. More precisely, if at
    second <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, a motorbike is
    at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i, j)$</span>, then at
    second <span class="tex2jax_process">$T+1$</span>, the
    motorbike will be at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i, j \bmod
    A + 1)$</span>.</p>
<p>Gon needs to go to the Examination Hall located inside the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>-th circle. At each
    second, Gon can either stay at his current position, or move to
    an adjacent arc. Two arcs are adjacent if they share at least
    two points. From any arcs in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>-th circle, Gon can move to the
    Examination Hall.</p>
<p>Because Gon moves slightly faster than any motorbikes:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If Gon moves from cell <span class="tex2jax_process">$(u, v)$</span> to cell <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span>:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Gon will <b class="bfseries">not</b> be hit by
            motorbikes coming into cell <span class="tex2jax_process">$(u, v)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gon will be hit by motorbikes coming from or into
            cell <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Gon stays at cell <span class="tex2jax_process">$(u,
        v)$</span>, he will be hit by motorbikes coming into cell
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$(u, v)$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, in the above illustration, Gon can move as
    follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>At second <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>: Gon
        moves to arc <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 1)$</span>,
        the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> motorbikes
        move to arc <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 3)$</span>
        and arc <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 8)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At second <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>: Gon
        moves to arc <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3, 1)$</span>,
        the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> motorbikes
        move to arc <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 4)$</span>
        and arc <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 1)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At second <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>: Gon
        moves to Examination Hall, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> motorbikes move to arc
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 5)$</span> and arc
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 2)$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If at second <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>,
        Gon moves to arc <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,
        2)$</span>, he will be hit by the motorbike moving from arc
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 2)$</span> to arc
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 3)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If at second <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>,
        Gon stays at arc <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2,
        1)$</span>, he will also be hit by the motorbike moving
        from arc <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 8)$</span> to
        arc <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 1)$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Hunter Exam is starting soon, and Gon has not figured
    out how to cross the road yet. Please help him.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \le C \cdot A \le 10^5)$</span>.</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> lines follow, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line contains
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> characters
    representing the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    circle. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th
    character in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    line can be either ‘G’, ‘M’ or ‘.’, representing the arc where
    Gon stands, an arc with a motorbike, or an empty arc,
    respectively.</p>
<p>The first character of the first line is always ‘G’, and
    this is the only ‘G’ in the input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print exactly one integer — the minimum time for Gon to
    reach the Examination Hall. If it is impossible for Gon to
    reach the Examination Hall, print <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
