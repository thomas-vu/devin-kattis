</div>As you might know, the memory in current computers
    consists of a sequence of bits and each of these bits can be in
    two possible states. Megan’s company has now developed a great
    new memory unit where every bit has three possible states. This
    would all be great, if it wasn’t for Megan’s boss. The boss
    wants her to write a program for this memory unit for integer
    operations, but instead of using ternary base (i.e., base 3),
    Megan’s boss decided that the bits should be interpreted as a
    binary number, with the exception that the digit 2 is allowed
    as well.

    <p>For example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$201$</span> in
    this strange representation is <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\cdot 2^2+0\cdot 2^1+ 1\cdot 2^0=9$</span>.
    Some numbers are shorter in this representation, but for other
    numbers it doesn’t help at all – for instance, <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1111$</span> in binary and this is the only
    way of writing it in the new representation as well.</p>
<p>It seems that there is nothing else that Megan can do to
    convince her boss. Since she likes math, she started wondering
    about different representations of the same number. For example
    9 has three representations: <span class="tex2jax_process">$201, 121$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1001$</span>. Can you help her figure out
    how many representations a given number has?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of the input contains a string
    consisting of <tt class="tt">’0’</tt> and <tt class="tt">’1’</tt>. The string represents a non-negative integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> in binary. The
    leftmost bit is the most significant one. The number of bits
    will be at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a line giving the number of different binary
    representations of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    that also use <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> as a
    digit. Since this number might be big, output the remainder
    modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\,
    009$</span>.</p>
