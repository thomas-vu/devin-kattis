</div>After sailing the Seven Seas and raiding many ships,
    Cap’n Red and his crew of fellow pirates are finally ready to
    divide their loot. According to ancient traditions, the crew
    stands in a circle ordered by a strict pirate hierarchy. Cap’n
    Red starts by taking a fraction <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> of the loot and passing the
    remainder on to the next pirate. That pirate takes the same
    fraction <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> of the loot
    left over by the previous pirate and passes the remainder on to
    the following pirate. Each pirate behaves in the same way,
    taking a fraction <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> of
    what is left and passing on the rest. The last pirate in the
    hierarchy passes the remainder on to Cap’n Red, who starts
    another round of this “fair” division, and so on, indefinitely.
    <p>Fortunately, pirates in the 21st century can use a computer
    to avoid this lengthy process and constant nitpicking when the
    fraction <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> does not
    exactly divide the loot at some step. You have been captured by
    the pirates and asked to come up with a suitable fraction
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>. As an incentive,
    Cap’n Red has promised to leave you alive if you succeed.</p>
<p>The fraction <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> needs
    to be a rational number strictly between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. It is not necessary that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> exactly divides the
    loot remaining at any step of the round-robin process described
    above. However, the total loot that would be assigned to each
    pirate by carrying out this process infinitely needs to be an
    integer.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains one line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$6
    \leq n \leq 10^6$</span>) is the number of pirates including
    Cap’n Red and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 10^{18}$</span>)
    is the total value of their loot.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with two positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$f = \frac{p}{q}$</span> as specified above.
    If there are multiple suitable fractions, choose one with the
    smallest <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>. Among
    multiple suitable fractions with the same smallest <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> choose the one with the smallest
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>. If there is no
    suitable fraction, output <tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>
    instead and hope for mercy.</p>
