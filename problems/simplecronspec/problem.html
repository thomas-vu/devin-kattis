<div class="problembody">
<p>A <em>Cron Spec</em> is used by Linux to specify when to
    repeatedly execute a certain job. For this problem, consider a
    <em>Simple Cron Spec</em> that defines when a job needs to be
    run within a single day. A <em>Simple Cron Spec</em> has three
    space separated tokens:</p>
<center>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$hours$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$minutes$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$seconds$</span>
</center>
<p>that specify at which hours/minutes/seconds a job will be
    run. Hour values are <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>-<span class="tex2jax_process">$23$</span>, minute and second values are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>-<span class="tex2jax_process">$59$</span>.</p>
<p>Each token consists of a single integer value, a value range
    (two values separated by a dash ‘<tt class="tt">-</tt>’), a
    comma-separated list of multiple values and/or value ranges, or
    an asterisk (‘<tt class="tt">*</tt>’). A value range represents
    all integer values between the low and high value, inclusive.
    An asterisk is a special token that represents all possible
    values. The specified values in any comma separated list must
    be non-overlapping.</p>
<p>For example, the specification:</p>
<center>
<tt class="tt">* 30 20,25,30-33</tt>
</center>
<p>says the job will be run every hour, at minute <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span>, and second <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$33$</span>, for a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$24 \times 1 \times 6 = 144$</span> times
    each day.</p>
<p>Given a list of <em>Simple Cron Specs</em>, determine two
    things: First, the number of seconds in the day that at least
    one job will start, and second, the total number of job starts
    during the day. Note that if a single job starts 24 times in a
    day, that counts as 24 job starts.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100$</span>), which is the
    number of <em>Simple Cron Specs</em> that follow.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains three strings <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>. These are the hours, minutes, and
    seconds specifications of the <em>Simple Cron Specs</em>. Each
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> consists of either a single star
    (‘<tt class="tt">*</tt>’), or a comma-separated list of one or
    more values or value ranges (two values separated by
    ‘<tt class="tt">-</tt>’). The values/ranges are guaranteed to
    be within the appropriate limits (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$23$</span> for hours, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$59$</span> for minutes and seconds), and are
    guaranteed to not overlap. All range specifications are
    guaranteed to consist of two distinct values, smallest first.
    All values specified in a comma-separated list are guaranteed
    to be in strictly increasing order. The whole is guaranteed to
    be a legitimate <em>Simple Cron Spec</em>. The only spaces in
    the line will be a single space between <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, and a single space between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two space separated integers. The first is the number
    of seconds in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>
    hour day with at least one job start, and the second is the
    total number of job starts.</p>
