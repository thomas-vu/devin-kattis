<p>Thomas is the best student in his class. One would think
    that it is fantastic for him to know all the stuff their
    teacher is speaking about... but unfortunately, he keeps
    becoming very very bored during the lessons. To prevent himself
    from falling asleep he draws silly drawings into his notebook,
    solves funny riddles, plays with paper and so on... A few
    minutes ago he wrote a long sentence on a slip of paper and now
    and then he flips the slip (so that the sentence becomes
    reversed and upside-down) and cuts off one quarter of letters
    (rounding down if necessary) from the right side of the
    remaining part of the slip.</p>
<p>However, the teacher does not like students that do not pay
    attention during his lectures. So as soon as he noticed Thomas
    is playing with the slip of paper he seized it. Bored Thomas
    would like to continue his game. To do this, however, he needs
    to know what exactly was written on the slip at the moment it
    was seized. Naturally, he remembers the original sentence and
    the number of rotate&amp;cuts.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input file describes several cases; the number of the
    cases is given on the first line and is at most 200.</p>
<p>For each case there is one line describing it. The line
    starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    – the number of Thomas’s rotate&amp;cuts, followed by a space
    and the original sentence Thomas wrote on the slip. You may
    assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is at most
    1 000 000 000. The sentence is composed only from lowercase and
    uppercase letters and has at most 2000 characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For every case output one line containing the remaining part
    of the sentence after the specified number of rotate&amp;cuts.
    (Even if the sentence ended upside down, output it in the way
    we would read it.)</p>
