<p>Agamemnon, the great king of Mycenae, was assembling his
    troops in Aulis to sail to the shores of Troy, when he had a
    vision of goddess Artemis. In this vision, Agamemnon found out
    that he had accidentally slain a deer that was sacred to
    Artemis, and now the goddess swore to make Agamemnon suffer on
    his voyage to Troy.</p>
<p>Along his route to Troy, Agamemnon was planning to stop at
    the islands of Crete to gather resources for his formidable
    army. If Artemis were to find out about the sea routes
    Agamemnon took, she would use her powers to stop the wind along
    those routes, leaving Agamemnon and his crew stranded. As the
    trusty advisor of Agamemnon, you now have to help him devise a
    path between the islands of Crete that provides the army the
    maximum amount of resources, without letting Artemis discover
    the routes you take.</p>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> islands of
    Crete are connected to each other via <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> sea routes. Along each route,
    Agamemnon can acquire a certain amount of resources. However,
    if a route is used more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> times, Artemis will detect the
    presence of Agamemnon along that route and stop the wind along
    that route. So, a feasible plan cannot use any route more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> times.</p>
<p>Given that Agamemnon can start and end at any of the islands
    of Crete, come up with a feasible plan that maximises
    Agamemnonâ€™s resource earnings. Note that Agamemnon can only
    collect resources along a sea route during its first use. He
    does not earn extra resources from a route on reusing it.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input will contain two integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$</span>) and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq 10^9$</span>), the number of
    islands of Crete, and the maximum number of times a single
    route may be used without being discovered by Artemis. The
    islands of Crete are guaranteed to be connected by the sea
    routes.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span>
    lines describe the sea routes. Each line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> integers each, <span class="tex2jax_process">$u, v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq u, v \leq N, u \neq v$</span>) and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq c \leq 10^9$</span>), explaining that
    the sea route connects islands <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> and Agamemnon can acquire
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> units of resources
    along this route. All sea routes are bidirectional, i.e. they
    can be used to travel from island <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>, or from island <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single value, the maximum amount of resources
    Agamemnon can acquire with a feasible plan, as described in the
    statement.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> islands
    in Crete, connected to each other via <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> routes, as shown in the figure:
    the first connecting island <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and allowing Agamemnon to acquire
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> units of resources and
    so on. In this archipelago, the best plan for Agamemnon is to
    start at island <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, visit
    island <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> (acquiring
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> units of resources
    along the <span class="tex2jax_process">$4\to 1$</span> route),
    and then end his path at island <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> (acquiring another <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> units of resources along the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\to 5$</span> route), having
    earned a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>
    units of resources.</p>
