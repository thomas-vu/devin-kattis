<div class="problembody">
<p>Jack and Jill have decided to separate and divide their
    property equally. Each of their <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> mansions has a value between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$40\, 000\, 000$</span> dollars.
    Jack will receive some of the mansions; Jill will receive some
    of the mansions; the remaining mansions will be sold, and the
    proceeds split equally.</p>
<p>Neither Jack nor Jill can tolerate the other receiving
    property with higher total value. The sum of the values of the
    mansions Jack receives must be equal to the sum of the values
    of the mansions Jill receives. So long as the value that each
    receives is equal, Jack and Jill would like each to receive
    property of the highest possible value.</p>
<p>Given the values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    mansions, compute the value of the mansions that must be sold
    so that the rest may be divided so as to satisfy Jack and
    Jill.</p>
<h2>Example</h2>
<p>Suppose Jack and Jill own <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> mansions valued at <span class="tex2jax_process">$6\, 000\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$30\, 000\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\, 000,000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$11\, 000\, 000$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\, 000\, 000$</span> dollars. To satisfy
    their requirements, Jack or Jill would receive the mansion
    worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$6\, 000\, 000$</span> and
    the other would receive both mansions worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\, 000\, 000$</span> dollars. The mansions
    worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$11\, 000\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$30\, 000\, 000$</span> dollars
    would be sold, for a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$41\, 000\, 000$</span> dollars. The answer
    is therefore <span class="tex2jax_process">$41\, 000\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a sequence of test cases. The first
    line of each test case contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of mansions, which
    will be no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>.
    This line is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, each giving the value of a
    mansion and it will be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$40\, 000\, 000$</span>. The final line of
    input contains the integer zero. This line is not a test case
    and should not be processed. The sum of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> over all test cases is at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing a single
    integer, the value of the mansions that must be sold so that
    the rest may be divided so as to satisfy Jack and Jill.</p>
