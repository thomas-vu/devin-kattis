<p>Per-Magnus managed to solve his addition homework thanks to
    you, but now he is unfortunately posed with an even greater
    problem.</p>
<p>He has been given a triangular cake by his mother, and
    wonders what the area of it is. It turns out Per-Magnus forgot
    the formula for computing it!</p>
<p>Per-Magnus managed to measure the base and height of the
    triangle with a ruler. Given this, compute the area of the
    triangular cake.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line with two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$ 1 \le h \le 1000 $</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le b \le 1000$</span>, the
    height and base of the triangle.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single number, the area of the triangle. Your
    answer must be correct within an absolute or relative error of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-7}$</span>.</p>
