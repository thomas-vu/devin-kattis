<p>Like so many good stories, this one begins with a claim that
    Kari is a faster runner than Ola, who of course challenges Kari
    to a run-down. Dubbed (rather ironically) Non-Competitive Pace
    Challenge, they want to see who can run the furthest in a
    certain amount of timeÂ <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>. Clearly they both choose to run
    in straight lines with constant speed.</p>
<p>Kari wrote an app to make sure that Ola does not cheat, but
    the app requires that their phones constantly communicate over
    Bluetooth.</p>
<p>After their run, Kari needs to ensure that they were never
    too far apart from each other at any time during the run. Write
    a program that computes the maximum distance between Kari and
    Ola at any point during the run.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing eight
    integers describing four points:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>the starting position of Kari,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the starting position of Ola,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ending position of Kari, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the ending position of Ola,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>in that order. Each point is given by two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le x, y \le 10^4$</span>), the coordinates of the point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum distance between Kari and Ola during
    their run, with an absolute or relative error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
