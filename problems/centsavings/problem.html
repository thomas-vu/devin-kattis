</div>To host a regional contest like NWERC a lot of
    preparation is necessary: organizing rooms and computers,
    making a good problem set, inviting contestants, designing
    T-shirts, booking hotel rooms and so on. I am responsible for
    going shopping in the supermarket.

    <p>When I get to the cash register, I put all my <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> items on the conveyor belt and
    wait until all the other customers in the queue in front of me
    are served. While waiting, I realize that this supermarket
    recently started to round the total price of a purchase to the
    nearest multiple of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    cents (with <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> cents
    being rounded upwards). For example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$94$</span> cents are rounded to <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span> cents, while <span class="tex2jax_process">$95$</span> are rounded to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>.</p>
<p>It is possible to divide my purchase into groups and to pay
    for the parts separately. I managed to find <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> dividers to divide my purchase in
    up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$d+1$</span> groups. I
    wonder where to place the dividers to minimize the total cost
    of my purchase. As I am running out of time, I do not want to
    rearrange items on the belt.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \le 2\, 000$</span>) and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d \le 20$</span>), the number of
        items and the number of available dividers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1, \ldots p_
        n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p_ i \leq
        10\, 000$</span> for <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i
        \le n$</span>), the prices of the items in cents. The
        prices are given in the same order as the items appear on
        the belt.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum amount of money needed to buy all the
    items, using up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>
    dividers.</p>
