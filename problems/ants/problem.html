<p>An army of ants walk on a horizontal pole of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> cm, each with a
    constant speed of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    cm/s. When a walking ant reaches an end of the pole, it
    immediatelly falls off it. When two ants meet they turn back
    and start walking in opposite directions. We know the original
    positions of ants on the pole, unfortunately, we do not know
    the directions in which the ants are walking. Your task is to
    compute the earliest and the latest possible times needed for
    all ants to fall off the pole.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer giving the
    number of cases that follow, at most 100. The data for each
    case start with two integer numbers: the length <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> of the pole (in cm) and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of ants
    residing on the pole. These two numbers are followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers giving the
    position of each ant on the pole as the distance measured from
    the left end of the pole, in no particular order. All input
    integers are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span> and
    they are separated by whitespace.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case of input, output two numbers separated by a
    single space. The first number is the earliest possible time
    when all ants fall off the pole (if the directions of their
    walks are chosen appropriately) and the second number is the
    latest possible such time.</p>
