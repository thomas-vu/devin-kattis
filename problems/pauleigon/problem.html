<p>Paul Eigon recently got a new job at a famous company in
    town. They have all sorts of cool stuff at the office. Video
    games, a swimming pool, a sauna, and even a ping-pong table!
    Paul really loves his enjoyable new workplace.</p>
<p>Mr. Eigon plays a lot of ping-pong at work. While he is
    playing, he enjoys having a nice conversation with his
    opponent. Discussions are jolly fun to have, but they can also
    be a bit distracting, enough for Paul to sometimes completely
    forget whose turn it is to serve the ball the upcoming
    round!</p>
<p>Paul’s ping-pong games are played with simple rules. The
    game is played by two players. The game starts with one of the
    players serving the ball, and that player does so during the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> first rounds. After
    that, the other player serves the ball for <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> rounds, and so on. Each round is
    won by exactly one of the players and a player gets one point
    for each won round (there can be no draws). When one of the
    players has reached a certain number of points, that player
    wins the game.</p>
<p>Paul is in desperate need of a new way to figure out which
    player should serve the ball the upcoming round, and he wants
    you to help him. You should write a program that given
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and the current score
    of the game prints out whose turn it is to serve the ball the
    upcoming round. His plan is to run your program on his secret
    high technology pocket computer, in order to impress his
    opponent. And by the way, Paul always serves the first ball (if
    that makes it easier for you).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> on a single line. <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10^9$</span> denotes the
    number of serves a player will perform in a row before it is
    the other player’s turn to serve the ball. <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq P \leq 10^9$</span> denotes Paul’s
    current score in the ongoing ping-pong game, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq Q \leq 10^9$</span> denotes his
    opponent’s score.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output should consists of a single word on a single line. If
    it is Paul’s turn to serve the ball, your program should output
    <tt class="ttfamily">paul</tt>. Otherwise, your program should
    output <tt class="ttfamily">opponent</tt>.</p>
