<div class="problembody">
<p>Emil, a Polish mathematician, sent a simple puzzle by post
    to his British friend, Alan. Alan sent a reply saying he didn’t
    have an infinite amount of time he could spend on such
    non-essential things. Emil modified his puzzle (making it a bit
    more restricted) and sent it back to Alan. Alan then solved the
    puzzle.</p>
<p>Here is the original puzzle Emil sent: given a sequence of
    pairs of strings <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a_1, b_1),
    (a_2, b_2), \ldots , (a_ k, b_ k)$</span>, find a non-empty
    sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1, s_2, \ldots , s_
    m$</span> such that the following is true:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ a_{s_1}a_{s_2}\ldots a_{s_ m} =
    b_{s_1}b_{s_2}\ldots b_{s_ m} \]</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{s_1} a_{s_2} \ldots
    $</span> indicates string concatenation. The modified puzzle
    that Emil sent added the following restriction: for all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i\neq j$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i\neq s_ j$</span>.</p>
<p>You don’t have enough time to solve Emil’s original puzzle.
    Can you solve the modified version?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> test cases, ending at end of file.
    Each case starts with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq 11$</span>, followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines. Each of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines contains two
    space-separated lowercase alphabetic strings which represent a
    pair. Each individual string will be non-empty and at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters long.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, display the case number followed by the
    sequence found (if it is possible to form one) or “<tt class="tt">IMPOSSIBLE</tt>” (if it is not possible to solve the
    problem). If it is possible but there are multiple sequences,
    you should prefer the shortest one (in terms of the number of
    characters output). If there are multiple shortest sequences,
    choose the one that is lexicographically first. Follow the
    format of the sample output.</p>
