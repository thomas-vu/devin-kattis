</div>Fat contains about 9 Calories/g of food energy. Protein,
    sugar, and starch contain about 4 Calories/g, while alcohol
    contains about 7 Calories/g. Although many people consume more
    than 50% of their total Calories as fat, most dieticians
    recommend that this proportion should be 30% or less. For
    example, in the <em>Nutrition Facts</em> label to the right, we
    see that 3g of fat is 5% of the recommended daily intake based
    on a 2,000 calorie diet. A quick calculation reveals that the
    recommended daily intake of fat is therefore 60g; that is, 540
    Calories or 27% Calories from fat.

    <p>Others recommend radically different amounts of fat. Dean
    Ornish, for example, suggests that less than 10% of total
    caloric intake should be fat. On the other hand, Robert Atkins
    recommends the elimination of all carbohydrate with no
    restriction on fat. It has been estimated that the average
    Atkins dieter consumes 61% of Calories from fat.</p>
<p>From a record of food eaten in one day, you are to compute
    the percent Calories from fat. The record consists of one line
    of input per food item, giving the quantity of fat, protein,
    sugar, starch and alcohol in each. Each quantity is an integer
    followed by a unit, which will be one of: g (grams), C
    (Calories), or % (percent Calories). Percentages will be
    between 0 and 99. At least one of the ingredients will be given
    as a non-zero quantity of grams or Calories (not percent
    Calories).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input will consist of several test cases (at most 150). Each
    test case will have one or more lines as described above (at
    most 100). Each test case will be terminated by a line
    containing ’-’. An additional line containing ’-’ will follow
    the last test case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print percent Calories from fat, rounded
    to the nearest integer.</p>
