<div class="problembody">
<p>You stay in a cottage at a clearing in a forest. The forest
    consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> clearings
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> trails. Clearings
    are open spots where fruits may be found, and are numbered from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span>. Your cottage is at clearing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Trails connects two
    clearings. You ensure self sustainability by gathering fruits
    in the forest for food.</p>
<p>Through extensive reconnaissance, you learn that there are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> clearings containing
    exactly one batch of growing fruits. You also learn that fruits
    in this forest, once picked, will take <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> days to grow before it is ready to
    be picked again. (A fruit picked on day <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is ready to be picked again on day
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X + K$</span>)</p>
<p>It is currently day <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Coincidentally, all <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> clearings have one batch of fruits
    ready to be picked. From now until day <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> inclusive, what is the minimum
    distance you have to walk per day in order to be able to gather
    at least one batch of fruits and return to your cottage every
    day?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq V \leq 20\, 000$</span>) <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq E \leq 100\, 000$</span>) <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq C \leq V$</span>) <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq K \leq 2\, 000\, 000\,
    000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq 2\, 000\, 000\,
    000$</span>).</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> lines
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>
    space-separated integers each, <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_ i\: v_ i\: w_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq u_ i, v_ i \leq V$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq w_ i \leq 1\, 000\,
    000$</span>) describing a trail that directly connects clearing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> to clearing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> directly with a length
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> unit distance.
    There are at most one trail directly connecting any two
    clearings, and no trail connects a clearing to itself. There
    could be clearings that cannot be reached from the cottage.</p>
<p>The last line of the input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> distinct space separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_ C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq f \leq V$</span>), the clearings
    where fruits grow.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single valueâ€”the required answer. If it is
    impossible to gather at least one batch of fruits every day
    from day <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> until day
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> instead.</p>

<h2>Sample Input Explanation</h2>
<p>For sample <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, there
    are <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> clearings with
    fruits, one located at clearing <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> unit distance away from the
    cottage) and one located at clearing <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> unit distance away from the
    cottage). Suppose you pick the fruit at clearing <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> on day <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. The total distance traveled on
    this day is <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> units- the
    distance from your cottage to clearing <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and back. On day <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, the fruit at clearing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> has not grown back yet
    (it will be available for picking on day <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>), and you will have to walk to
    clearing <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> for fruits.
    The furthest distance you have walked in a single day so far is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> units- the distance
    from the cottage to clearing <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and back. The answer is the same
    if you had instead picked the fruits at clearing <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> first and then clearing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.</p>
<p>For sample <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, the
    fruits at both clearings do not grow back in time.</p>
