<blockquote class="quote">
      “It’s like how hot dogs come in packs of ten, and buns come
      in packs of eight or twelve — you have to buy nine packs to
      make it come out even.”
    </blockquote>
<p>This is a quote from the 1986 movie, “True Stories”, and
    it’s true; well, almost true. You could buy four packs of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> hotdogs and five
    packs of <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> buns. That
    would give you exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span> of each. However, you can make
    things even with fewer packs if you buy two packs of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> hotdogs, along with a
    pack of <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> buns and
    another pack of <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> buns.
    That would give you <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>
    of each, using only <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>
    total packs.</p>
<p>For this problem, you’ll determine the fewest packs you need
    to buy to make hotdogs and buns come out even, given a
    selection of different bun and hotdog packs available for
    purchase.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first input line starts with an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>, the number of hotdog packs
    available. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_1 \ldots h_ H$</span>, the number of
    hotdogs in each pack. The second input line starts with an
    integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, giving the
    number of bun packs available. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_1 \ldots b_ B$</span>, indicating the
    number of buns in each pack. The values <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, inclusive, and the sizes of the
    packs are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>, inclusive.
    Every available pack is listed individually. For example, if
    there were five eight-bun packs available for purchase, the
    list of bun packs would contain five copies of the number
    eight.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it’s not possible to purchase an equal number of one or
    more hotdogs and buns, just output “<span class="mbox" style="width:">impossible</span>”. Otherwise, output the smallest
    number of total packs you can buy (counting both hotdog and bun
    packs) to get exactly the same number of hotdogs and buns.</p>
