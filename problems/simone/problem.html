    The sequence stops. Now you repeat it.</p>
<p>Consider the following generalization <em>Simone</em> of
    this classic game. In Simone, a sequence of lights of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> different colours will
    flash; the player must memorize this sequence and play it back.
    Simone is such a popular game that it has become a game show
    played during prime time TV.</p>
<p>You are working behind the scenes during a live taping of
    this show. Unfortunately, the random number generator has
    stopped working! Quickly, pick a colour that should be added to
    the sequence the contestant just successfully repeated!</p>
<p>You decide to pick a colour that has appeared the least
    frequently in the sequence. Which colours can you choose
    from?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N,K$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 1\, 000$</span>) is the length of the sequence
    played so far and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq K \leq 1\, 000$</span>)
    is the number of colours available to use.</p>
<p>The second line consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space-separated integers, each
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>. This is the sequence
    of colours the contestant just successfully repeated.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first line of output contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> indicating the number
    of colours from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (inclusive) that
    appear the least frequently in the sequence. The second line
    lists these colours in increasing order with a single space
    between consecutive numbers.</p>
