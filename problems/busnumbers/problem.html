<p>Your favourite public transport company LS (we cannot use
    their real name here, so we permuted the letters) wants to
    change signs on all bus stops. Some bus stops have quite a few
    buses that stop there and listing all the buses takes space.
    However, if for example buses <span class="tex2jax_process">$141$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$142$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$143$</span> stop there, we can write
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$141$</span>â€“<span class="tex2jax_process">$143$</span> instead and this saves space.
    Note that just for two buses this does not save space.</p>
<p>You are given a list of buses that stop at a bus stop. What
    is the shortest representation of this list?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains one integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N, 1\leq N\leq 1\, 000$</span>,
    the number of buses that stop at a bus stop. Then next line
    contains a list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    space separated integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>, which denote the bus
    numbers. All numbers are distinct.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the shortest representation of the list of bus
    numbers. Use the format as in the example, separate numbers
    with single spaces and output them in sorted order.</p>
