        From Gorman Lobby at University of Dallas
      </div>
</div>As the door slams shut behind Agent Youdy, he realizes
    that his daring escape from his arch-enemy’s lair is not quite
    done. Before him lies a grid of numbered squares, and off in
    the distance he sees the exit door. He recognizes this setup
    from his training. It’s a Sum Trap, and works as follows:
    <p>He must begin by stepping onto the square closest to
    himself, which we can think of as square <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 1)$</span>, and walk to some other
    square, which we can think of as square <span class="tex2jax_process">$(X, Y)$</span> for some <span class="tex2jax_process">$X, Y &gt; 1$</span>. Each step he takes is
    in either the positive-X or positive-Y direction, one square at
    a time. Every square has a number on it in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, and the grid carefully monitors
    which squares he steps on. When he reaches the door, if the sum
    of the squares that he stepped on is sufficiently small, the
    door will open and he will be free. If not, he will be trapped
    forever.</p>
<p>After scanning the board for a while Agent Youdy becomes
    convinced that there is no path to success. But then he
    remembers a cryptic Code Key that he found while searching the
    lair. He reaches into his pocket and removes a paper with a
    large integer on it, each of whose digits is in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>. His training kicks in again, and
    he remembers the way this works: whenever he wishes, he may use
    the leading digit of the key, which permits him to hop over
    exactly that many squares. Whenever he uses a leading digit, it
    is removed from the number. Note that hops, no matter how far,
    change only his <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>- or
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-coordinate, but not
    both.</p>
<p>For example, starting at the “1” on the bottom left corner
    in the figure shown, with Code Key <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>, his best path is step right,
    step right, hop right, hop up, step right, step up, for a total
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1+0+3+2+1+1+8=16$</span>. But
    starting with Code Key <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>, his best path is step right, hop
    up, hop right, step right, step up, for a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$18$</span>.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, giving the width and
    height of the grid (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq X, Y
    \leq 100$</span>). The next line contains a positive integer,
    the Code Key, guaranteed to be less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{50}$</span> and containing only positive
    digits. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>
    lines, each containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>
    digits, giving the numbers on the grid of squares. The last
    digit of the first of these lines represents Agent Youdy’s
    destination, and the first digit of the last line represents
    his starting square.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The smallest sum possible on a path from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 1)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(X, Y)$</span>, including the endpoints.</p>
