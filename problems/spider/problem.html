</div>In the <em>Mosquito</em> problem, you have seen that the
    potential reproductive capabilities of insects are very high.
    Fortunately for us humans, the insects also have natural
    enemies that help to reduce their population. Spiders belong
    among the best known insect predators, so there is no wonder we
    included them in this problem set.
    <p>Simon the Spider ate many insects this summer and got fat.
    The threads of his web will soon be too thin to carry him and
    so he needs to reinforce them. Since fat spiders are also lazy,
    Simon wants to use as little material as possible — well, you
    know that spiders have to produce the material for building
    webs by themselves. Finally, he decided to reinforce only some
    of the threads, but it is important that every node of his web
    must be reachable over the reinforced links.</p>
<p>Additionally, Simon plans to spend his free time on one of
    the reinforced links and he wants this one link to be long.
    Therefore, when calculating the total length of all reinforced
    links, the length of the longest reinforced link will be
    <em>subtracted</em> instead of added. Help Simon to decide
    which links should be reinforced to have the lowest possible
    total length under these circumstances.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of descriptions of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$35$</span> webs. The first line of each
    description contains two numbers: the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 1\, 000$</span>) of nodes in the web and the number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le M \le 1\, 000\, 000$</span>) of the
    links between pairs of nodes. Each of the following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines describes one
    link. The description of each link contains three positive
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_ i, v_ i, \ell _
    i$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_ i$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le u_ i, v_ i \le N$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_ i \neq v_ i$</span>) are the
    two nodes connected by the link and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell _ i$</span> is its length (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le \ell _ i \le 100\, 000$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each web, print a single line with the minimum
    possible total length of reinforced links under all given
    conditions. Remember that the total length is the sum of the
    lengths of all reinforced links <em>minus</em> twice the length
    of the longest reinforced link.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to reach every node from every other
    node through a sequence of links, then print <tt class="tt">disconnected</tt> instead of the cost.</p>
