<p>A knight’s tour on a rectangular board of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> rows and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> columns of squares (traditionally
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>-by-<span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>) is a labelling of the squares by
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \cdot m$</span> so that label
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n+1$</span> is a knight’s move
    from label <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. That is,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> squares horizontally
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> square vertically
    or <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> square horizontally
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> squares
    vertically. The image below shows an <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>-by-<span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> knight’s tour.</p>

<p>A knight’s tour (on a square board) is
    (<em>semi-</em>)magical if the sum of the values in each row
    and column is the same (for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>-by-<span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> case the sum would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$260$</span>). For this problem, you will be
    given a sequence of semi-magical <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>-by-<span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> knight’s tours with many of the
    labels removed (see the image below). Write a program to fill
    in the missing labels so the knight’s tour is
    <em>semi-</em>magical.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single data set consisting of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> lines of input. Each
    line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> integers
    separated by spaces giving the labels for the corresponding
    row. If the label value is <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>, the label has been removed and
    your program is to find the correct value to put in that place.
    There will be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$45$</span>
    removed labels with the value <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>. You may assume that the starting
    point of the tour (labeled <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>) was not removed and thus appears
    in the input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> lines
    containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> integers
    each, separated by spaces, filling in the removed values to
    give a complete semi-magical knight’s tour which includes the
    positive labels from the input. There may be multiple correct
    answers. Your result will be graded correct if it is a
    semi-magical knight’s tour and the positive labels from the
    input are in the same square in your answer.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Your output does not have to be lined up as
    shown in the Sample Output. Just make sure that each of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> lines of output has at
    least one space between each value on the line.</p>
