<p>The local building firm needs your help. They are building
    an apartment building where the walls are prefabricated and
    lifted in place using cranes. The building firm has located
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> possible locations for
    cranes, and needs to choose some of these so that the center of
    each wall can be reached by at least one crane. The cranes are
    quite expensive, so they want to use as few of them as
    possible. A crane can reach a wall if the wall’s center is at
    most a distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
    away.</p>
<p>The house that is to be built is rectangular with a length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> and width
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Find the minimum number of cranes required to reach the
    center of all four walls.</p>

</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains four space-separated
    positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, all at most 30. <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> denote the length and width of the
    house, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> denotes the
    number of possible crane locations, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> denotes the reaching distance of
    each crane.</p>
<p>This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines, each containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-100\leq x,y\leq 100$</span>), denoting a
    possible location for a crane. The coordinate system has its
    origin in the center of the building and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-coordinate along the length of the
    house. The walls thus have their centers at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)=(-\ell /2,0),(\ell
    /2,0),(0,-w/2),(0,w/2)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one integer, the minimum number of cranes required to
    reach all wall segments, or <tt>Impossible</tt> if not all wall
    segments can be reached.</p>
