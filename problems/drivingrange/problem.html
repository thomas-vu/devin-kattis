<p>These days, many carmakers are developing cars that run on
    electricity instead of gasoline. The batteries used in these
    cars are generally very heavy and expensive, so designers must
    make an important tradeoffs when determining the battery
    capacity, and therefore the range, of these vehicles. Your task
    is to help determine the minimum range necessary so that it is
    possible for the car to travel between any two cities on the
    continent.</p>
<p>The road network on the continent consists of cities
    connected by bidirectional roads of different lengths. Each
    city contains a charging station. Along a route between two
    cities, the car may pass through any number of cities, but the
    distance between each pair of consecutive cities along the
    route must be no longer than the range of the car. What is the
    minimum range of the car so that there is a route satisfying
    this constraint between every pair of cities on the
    continent?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two nonnegative
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, the number of cities
    and roads. Each of these integers is no larger than one
    million. The cities are numbered from 0 to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. The first line is followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> more lines, each
    describing a road. Each such line contains three non-negative
    integers. The first two integers are the numbers of the two
    cities connected by the road. The third integer is the length
    of the road, a positive integer no larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each road network, output a line containing one integer,
    the minimum range of the car that enables it to drive from
    every city to every other city. If it is not possible to drive
    from some city to some other city regardless of the range of
    the car, instead output a line containing the word <tt class="ttfamily">IMPOSSIBLE</tt>.</p>
