<p>You and your classmates are going on an exciting field trip
    to a downtown museum. Because the museum is an hour away, three
    buses of identical capacity and a van are dispatched as a means
    of transportation to the museum and back. The buses will first
    start loading only students, and once all students have been
    loaded then teachers will begin to fill in the remaining spots
    on the buses. Any remaining teachers will ride on the van. To
    make the bus ride more exciting, all the students are hoping
    for a “teacher free bus ride”! A teacher free bus ride is when
    none of the teachers are on a bus.</p>
<p>Students are grouped in <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> class sections of different sizes.
    Each class section is assigned a number from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. All students in one class section
    must ride on the same bus. The buses will board class sections
    in increasing order by number. In other words, the first bus
    will load sections numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, the second bus will load sections
    numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, and the third bus
    will load the sections numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$j+1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Every bus must have at least one
    class section assigned to it.</p>
<p>Given the sizes of each of the class sections, determine if
    it is possible to load students onto <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> identical buses and end up with a
    “teacher free bus ride!”</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of class sections
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le N \le 1\, 000\,
    000$</span>). The second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> integer represents
    the size of class section with number <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. Class section sizes can range
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1, 10\, 000]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is possible to load the students onto three identical
    buses in the above-described fashion and have a teacher free
    bus ride, then output two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le i &lt; j &lt; n$</span>) where <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is the number of the class section
    which is to be loaded last into the first bus, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> is the class section which is to
    be loaded last into the second bus. We can assume the third bus
    will load class sections <span class="tex2jax_process">$j+1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>If it is not possible, print “<tt class="ttfamily">-1</tt>”.</p>
