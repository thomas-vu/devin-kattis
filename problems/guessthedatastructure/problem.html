<div class="problembody">
<p>There is a bag-like data structure, supporting two
    operations:</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1\ x$</span>: Throw an
    element <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> into the
    bag.</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>: Take out an
    element from the bag.</p>
<p>Given a sequence of operations with return values, you’re
    going to guess the data structure. It is a stack (Last-In,
    First-Out), a queue (First-In, First-Out), a priority-queue
    (Always take out larger elements first) or something else that
    you can hardly imagine!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There are several test cases. Each test case begins with a
    line containing a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 1000$</span>). Each of the next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines is either a
    type-1 command, or an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> followed by an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>. This means that
    executing the type-2 command returned the element <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>. The value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is always a positive integer not
    larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>. The
    input is terminated by end-of-file (EOF). The size of input
    file does not exceed 1MB.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one of the following:</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">stack</tt><br/>
    It’s definitely a stack.</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">queue</tt><br/>
    It’s definitely a queue.</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">priority queue</tt><br/>
    It’s definitely a priority queue.</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt><br/>
    It can’t be a stack, a queue or a priority queue.</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">not sure</tt><br/>
    It can be more than one of the three data structures mentioned
    above.</p>
