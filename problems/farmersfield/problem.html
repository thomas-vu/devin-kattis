        Taeko in safflower field
      </div>
</div>
<p>Taeko Okajima is helping her relatives with their safflower
    field. She needs your help eliminating weeds from the safflower
    field. Her field is arranged in a <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> dimensional line of units, where
    each unit is either a safflower crop, empty space, or weed,
    denoted by <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> respectively. The first and last
    units are crops.</p>
<p>Taeko has herbicides, which kills all crops and weeds within
    a radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> of the
    location it is sprayed. Specifically if herbicide is sprayed at
    some location <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, then
    all crops and weeds between <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$i-r$</span> inclusive are killed. Taeko has
    an infinite amount of herbicide, so she can spray at as many
    locations as she wants.</p>
<p>Your task is to inform Taeko whether it is possible to kill
    all weeds without killing any of the safflower crops. Output a
    single string “POSSIBLE” or “IMPOSSIBLE”.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \: (1 \leq n \leq 10^5)$</span>, the
    number of units in the field. The second line contains a single
    length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> string that
    represents Taeko’s safflower field. This field consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>, representing a crop <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, empty space <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, or weed <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>, respectively. The third line
    contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$r \: (
    1\leq r \leq \lfloor \frac{n - 1}{2} \rfloor )$</span>, which
    represents the radius of the herbicide.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single string “POSSIBLE” or “IMPOSSIBLE”. Output
    “POSSIBLE” if it is possible to kill all weeds without killing
    any of the safflower crops. Output “IMPOSSIBLE” otherwise.</p>
