</div>Tira would like to join a multiplayer game with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> other players. Each
    player has a character with some features. There are a total of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> features, and each
    character has some subset of them.

    <p>The similarity between two characters <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> is calculated as follows: for each
    feature <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>, if both
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> have feature <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> or if none of them have feature
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>, the similarity
    increases by one.</p>
<p>Tira does not have a character yet. She would like to create
    a new, very original character so that the maximum similarity
    between Tira’s character and any other character is as low as
    possible.</p>
<p>Given the characters of the other players, your task is to
    create a character for Tira that fulfils the above requirement.
    If there are many possible characters, you can choose any of
    them.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 10^5$</span> is the number of
    players (excluding Tira) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le k \le 20$</span> is the number of features.</p>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    describing the existing characters. Each of these <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contains a string of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> digits which are
    either <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. A <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> in position <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> means the character has the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>’th feature, and a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> means that it does not
    have the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>’th
    feature.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line describing the features of Tira’s
    character in the same format as in the input. If there are
    multiple possible characters with the same smallest maximum
    similarity, any one of them will be accepted.</p>
