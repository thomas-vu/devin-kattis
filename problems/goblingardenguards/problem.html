<p>In an unprecedented turn of events, goblins recently
    launched an invasion against the Nedewsian city of Mlohkcots.
    Goblins—small, green critters—love nothing more than to
    introduce additional entropy into the calm and ordered lives of
    ordinary people. They fear little, but one of the few things
    they fear is water.</p>
<p>The goblin invasion has now reached the royal gardens, where
    the goblins are busy stealing fruit, going for joyrides on the
    lawnmower and carving the trees into obscene shapes, and King
    Lrac Fatsug has decreed that this nonsense stop
    immediately!</p>
<p>Thankfully, the garden is equipped with an automated
    sprinkler system. Enabling the sprinklers will soak all goblins
    within range, forcing them to run home and dry themselves.</p>
<p>Serving in the royal garden guards, you have been asked to
    calculate how many goblins will remain in the royal garden
    after the sprinklers have been turned on, so that the royal
    gardeners can plan their next move.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq g \leq 100\ 000$</span>, the number
    of goblins in the royal gardens.</p>
<p>Then, for each goblin follows the position of the goblin as
    two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x_ i \leq
    10\ 000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq y_ i
    \leq 10\ 000$</span>. The garden is flat, square and all
    distances are in meters. Due to quantum interference, several
    goblins can occupy exactly the same spot in the garden.</p>
<p>Then follows one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq m \leq 20\, 000$</span>, the number of sprinklers in the
    garden.</p>
<p>Finally, for each sprinkler follows the location of the
    sprinkler as two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq
    x_ i \leq 10\ 000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq y_ i \leq 10\ 000$</span>, and the integer radius
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq r \leq 100$</span> of the
    area it covers, meaning that any goblin at a distance of at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> from the point
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i, y_ i)$</span> will be
    soaked by this sprinkler. There can be several sprinklers in
    the same location.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of goblins remaining in the garden after
    the sprinklers have been turned on.</p>
