<p>The City of Manhattan is organized as a grid of streets and
    avenues, with streets running in the North-South direction and
    avenues running in the East-West direction. Streets are
    numbered from East to West starting from 1, and avenues are
    numbered from North to South starting from 1. Each intersection
    is labelled by the street and avenue number <span class="tex2jax_process">$(s, a)$</span>. The distance between two
    intersections <span class="tex2jax_process">$(s_1, a_1)$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(s_2, a_2)$</span> is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$|s_1-s_2| +
    |a_1-a_2|$</span>.</p>
<p>Your company operates several food trucks at different
    intersections in Manhattan and you want to have them spread out
    so they do not compete with each other. To estimate how spread
    out they are, you have decided to compute the total distance
    between every distinct pair of your food trucks. A small total
    distance would mean that on average, a pair of food truck is
    too close together.</p>
<p>What is the total distance between every distinct pair of
    food trucks?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 200\, 000$</span>), which is the number of food
    trucks.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    describe the food trucksâ€™ locations. Each of these lines
    contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s \leq 1\, 000\,
    000$</span>), which is the street number of this food truck,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a \leq 1\, 000\, 000$</span>), which
    is the avenue number of this food truck.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the total distance between every distinct pair of
    food trucks.</p>
