<p>You are but a humble villager with big dreams, and they are
    finally coming true! You have just been promoted to “general
    manager” at the best (only) tavern in your town, Creeper
    County.</p>
<p>You have much loyalty to this town - your original spawn
    point - but it’s not exactly a popular tourist destination. (It
    probably has something to do with the unfortunate name.) As a
    result, the tavern is on the verge of bankruptcy. But, after
    hours of boring work that only an NPC would do, you’ve come
    across something startling: the business is spending way too
    much money on receipt ink! Instead of spelling out “rabbit
    stew” on a receipt, for example, you could simply write “rbt
    stw” and get the same information across. All you have to do to
    save your beloved tavern from bankruptcy is write a program
    that will remove all of the unnecessary letters from the meal
    titles on your receipts! Are you up to the task?</p>
<p>You want to remove letters from each word according to the
    following 2 rules:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>First, if the word contains any adjacent repeated
        letters, all but one should be removed (eg. in “coffee”,
        one of the f’s and one of the e’s should be removed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, any remaining vowels - a, e, i, o, or u - should
        be removed, unless they are the first or last letter in a
        word (eg. in “orange” the “a” should be removed, but the
        “o” and “e” should not).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; n &lt; 1\, 000$</span>), denoting the
    number of words in the meal title. The second line is a string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, the meal title,
    consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    space-separated words. Each word <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; |w| &lt; 100$</span>) will consist of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span> lowercase letters in the standard
    English alphabet: [a-z].</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single string: the meal title <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> with all unnecessary letters
    removed from each word.</p>
