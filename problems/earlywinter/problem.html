<p>Yraglac really hates early winter. So he was greatly annoyed
    when it snowed early this year. His friend however claimed that
    summer is always too short in Galcary so there’s nothing to
    complain about.</p>
<p>Yraglac doesn’t believe his friend. So he decides to look up
    the historical weather report for the past <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> years to figure out when it
    usually starts snowing. For each year in the past <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> years, the historical weather
    report records <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span>, the
    number of days between the end of summer and the first day of
    snow on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm
    {th}$</span> year. You may assume it never snows during summer
    in Galcary, as that would be absurd.</p>
<p>Given the historical data, Yraglac would like to know the
    number of consecutive years right before the current year with
    a larger gap between the end of summer and the first day of
    snow. More formally, suppose the current year is <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>. Then he’d like to determine the
    largest integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> for
    which <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_{m-1}, d_{m-2},\ldots
    ,d_{m-k}&gt; d_ m$</span>, or determine that it had never
    snowed this early in the last <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> years.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ m$</span>. It is guaranteed that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 100$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq d_ m\leq 100$</span>.</p>
<p>The next line of the input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> integer denotes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_{m-i}$</span>. It is
    guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq
    d_{m-i}\leq 100$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If there exists an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> for which <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_{m-k}\leq d_ m$</span>, print “It hadn’t
    snowed this early in <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    years!” (without quotes). Otherwise, print “It had never snowed
    this early!” (without quotes).</p>
