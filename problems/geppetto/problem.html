<p>Everyone’s favorite character and puppet-maker Geppetto has
    opened a new pizza place, the best in town. Geppetto is trying
    to make the best pizza possible, but at the same time he
    doesn’t want to have a small selection of pizzas.</p>
<p>He makes his pizzas out of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> ingredients marked with numbers
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. All that would be simple if he
    could mix any ingredient with every ingredient on the pizza,
    but unfortunately, that is not the case. Sometimes some
    ingredients cannot mix and that creates additional
    complications for our pizza master.</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> pairs of
    ingredients that cannot be on the same pizza at the same time.
    Given these restrictions, Geppetto wants to know how many
    different pizzas he can make. Help him answer this question.
    Two pizzas are considered different if there is an ingredient
    of index <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> that is on
    one pizza, but not on the other.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 20$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq M
    \leq 400$</span>). Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines contains two different
    numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, they represent the
    prohibition of mixing ingredients marked with <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> on the pizza. (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a, b\leq N$</span>). All pairs of
    ingredients are not necessarily distinct, some pair could occur
    multiple times.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the number of
    different pizzas given the restrictions in the task.</p>
