<div class="problembody">
<p>Fritjof is going to his first ever pub crawl. Since he
    doesn’t want to go all out on his very first time, he’s decided
    that he’s only going to visit a single pub. As he likes all
    pubs equally much he will stay at the pub for an equal amount
    of time regardless of which pub it is. To still be able to brag
    about the amount of time he’s been on the pub crawl, he wants
    to visit the pub with the longest queue time. Which pub should
    Fritjof go to?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 10^5$</span>), the number of pubs Fritjof can
    choose between. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th
    of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contains the name of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th pub <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span>, the number of people in the
    queue <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq k_ i \leq 10^4$</span>) and the
    integer time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> it
    takes for each person to get in (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq t_ i \leq 10^4$</span>).</p>
<p>Each <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> is between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> characters long and only consists
    of lowercase and uppercase alphabetical characters (a-z and
    A-Z). All pub names are unique.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print one line with the name of the pub with the longest
    queue time and the total time it would take for Fritjof to
    enter the pub. If there are multiple pubs with the same queue
    time, print the first suitable pub in the list.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample 1</h2>
<p>The last two people in the queues for Gasquen and JAPripps
    will both enter at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>. But it would then take an
    additional <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> minutes until Fritjof
    could enter the pubs if he stood in their respective queues. To
    maximize the time spent queuing, Fritjof should queue for
    JAPripps for a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$120$</span> minutes.</p>
