<div class="problembody">
<p>Children in a kindergarten have received a large sack
    containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> candies. It
    has been decided that the candies are to be distributed among
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> children.</p>
<p>Each child has stated the number of candies that it wants.
    If a child isn’t given the amount of candy it wants, it will
    get angry. In fact it’ll get angrier for each candy it is
    deprived of. Some speculate that it’s anger will be equal to
    the square of the number of candy it is deprived of. For
    instance, if Mirko states that he wants <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span> candies but receives only
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$29$</span>, he would be missing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> candies, so his anger
    would be equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is an insufficient amount of candy to
    satisfy all children. Therefore, the candies should be
    distributed in such a way that the sum of the children’s anger
    is minimal.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \le M \le 2\cdot 10^9)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \le N \le 100\, 000)$</span>.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contain integers (one per line) which represent the wishes of
    the children. Those numbers are all strictly less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\cdot 10^9$</span>, and their
    sum always exceeds <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the minimum
    sum of the children’s anger.</p>
<p>Note: The test cases will ensure that the result fits in a
    64-bit unsigned integer.</p>
