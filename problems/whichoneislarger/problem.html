<p>A question that often confuses a chat bot is:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<span class="tex2jax_process">$9.9$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$9.11$</span>, which one is larger?
    </blockquote>
<p>Some chat bot would incorrectly state that <span class="tex2jax_process">$9.11$</span> is larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$9.9$</span>. Though we are not exactly sure
    what reasoning is behind that wrong answer, one hypothesis is
    that the chat bot might have compared the decimal numbers as
    integer tuples and thought that <span class="tex2jax_process">$(9, 11) &gt; (9, 9)$</span>. Integer tuples
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2, y_2)$</span> are compared
    by first comparing <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span>
    against <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span>, and if they
    are equal, then comparing <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1$</span> against <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_2$</span>.</p>
<p>Your task is to determine given two decimal numbers whether
    their comparison would confuse a chat bot that may use integer
    tuple comparison. That is, you want to check if the comparison
    result would be the same under integer tuple comparison and
    regular decimal comparison.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input has two lines. Each line has one positive decimal
    number with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> digits before the
    decimal point, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> digits after the
    decimal point. There are no leading or trailing zeros (a single
    zero before or after the decimal point is possible). The two
    decimal numbers are not equal.</p>
<p>You may assume that the chat bot discards any leading zeros
    when converting the digits after the decimal point to an
    integer in a tuple, e.g. <span class="tex2jax_process">$4.01$</span> converts to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(4, 1)$</span>. Note that it is possible
    that the two numbers are equal by integer tuple comparison, in
    which case it is considered to be a different result than the
    result of a regular decimal comparison.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the decimal number that is larger if the comparison
    would be the same under integer tuple comparison and regular
    decimal comparison. Otherwise, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
