<p>You are an archaeologist working at an excavation site where
    your team has found hundreds of clay tablets containing glyphs
    written in some ancient language. Not much is known about the
    language yet, but you know that there are only six different
    glyphs, each of them in the shape of a regular polygon with one
    vertex pointing to the right (see Figure 1(a) below). Only
    the boundary of each polygon is carved out of the clay.</p>

<p>You want to start analysing the language right away, so you
    need to get the text on the tablets into some machine readable
    format. Ideally, you would like to use an OCR (optical
    character recognition) tool for that, but you do not have one
    installed on your laptop and there is no internet connection at
    the site.</p>
<p>Because of this you have devised your own scheme to digitise
    the ancient writings: for every glyph on a tablet you first
    find a number of sample points that are in the carved out
    region, i.e. on the boundary of the polygon. Based on
    those sample points you then calculate a score for each of the
    six glyphs and mark the one with the highest score as the
    recognised glyph.</p>
<p>For a given number of corners <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \le k \le 8$</span>), the score is computed as follows. Two
    regular <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>-gons are
    fitted to the sample points, one from the inside and one from
    the outside, such that the following hold:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Each polygon is centered at the origin, i.e. all
        vertices have equal distance to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each polygon has a vertex on the positive <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The inner polygon is the largest such polygon containing
        none of the sample points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The outer polygon is the smallest such polygon
        containing all of the sample points.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An example can be seen in Figure 1(c). The score for
    this value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{A_\text {inner}}{A_\text
    {outer}}$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_\text
    {inner}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_\text
    {outer}$</span> are the areas of the inner and outer polygon,
    respectively.</p>
<p>Given a set of sample points, find the glyph with the
    highest score.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>), the number
        of sample points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x,y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^6 \le x,y \le 10^6$</span>),
        specifying a point at coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No sample point is at the origin and all points are
    distinct.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the optimal number of corners <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \le k \le 8$</span>), followed by the score obtained for that
    value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>. Your answer
    will be accepted if the absolute error does not exceed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>. If several
    values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> result in a
    score that is within <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> of the optimal score, any
    one of them will be accepted.</p>
