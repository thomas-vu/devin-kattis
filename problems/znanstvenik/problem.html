<p>In this economy, we all know how hard it is to get a job.
    Mirko, a recent college graduate, however, got lucky – he is
    now employed as a runeologist by the Language Institute of
    Croatia. His friend Slavko believes runeology isn’t a science
    and is hence angry at Mirko for believing the opposite. One
    foggy Christmas day, Mirko’s laptop broke. Since he isn’t great
    with computers, he gave it to Slavko to repair it. Slavko,
    feeling a little naughty, decided to mess up a particular file
    Mirko was working on.</p>
<p>This file contains a <b class="bfseries">matrix</b> of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rows and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> columns. Each element of the
    matrix is a single letter. <b class="bfseries">No two columns
    of the matrix are equal.</b> To have some fun with
    pseudo-scientist Mirko, Slavko decided he will <b class="bfseries">delete as many rows as possible</b> from the top of
    the table, without breaking the no-equal-column rule.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le R, C \le 1\, 000$</span>), the number of rows and the
    number of columns, respectively.</p>
<p>In each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>
    lines there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> small
    letters of the English alphabet. These <span class="tex2jax_process">$R \times C$</span> letters represent Mirko’s
    table (which does not have two equal columns).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the maximum number of rows which
    can be deleted from the top of the table so that no two columns
    are equal.</p>
