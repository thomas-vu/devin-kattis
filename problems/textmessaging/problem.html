<div class="problembody">
<p>Professor Loony, a dear friend of mine, stormed into my
    office. His face was red and he looked very angry. The first
    thing that came out of his mouth was "Damn those phone
    manufacturers. I was trying to send a text message, and it took
    me more than ten minutes to type a one-line message." I tried
    to calm him down. "But what is wrong? Why did it take you so
    long?" He continued, "Don’t you see?! Their placement of the
    letters is so messed up? Why is ’s’ the 4th letter on its key?
    and ’e’? Why is it not the first letter on its key? I have to
    press ’7’ FOUR times to type an ’s’? This is lunacy!"</p>
<p>"Calm down, my friend," I said, "This scheme has been in use
    for so long, even before text messaging was invented. They had
    to keep it that way."</p>
<p>"That’s not an excuse," his face growing redder and redder.
    "It is time to change all this. It was a stupid idea to start
    with. And while we are at it, how come they only put letters on
    8 keys? Why not use all 12? And why do they have to be
    consecutive?"</p>
<p>"Umm... I... don’t... know," I replied.</p>
<p>"Ok, that’s it. Those people are clearly incompetent. I am
    sure someone can come up with a better scheme."</p>
<p>He was one of those people, I could see. People who complain
    about the problem, but never actually try to solve it.</p>
<p>In this problem, you are required to come up with the best
    letter placement of keys to minimize the number of key presses
    required to type a message. You will be given the number of
    keys, the maximum number of letters we can put on every key,
    the total number of letters in the alphabet, and the frequency
    of every letter in the message. Letters can be placed anywhere
    on the keys and in any order. Each letter can only appear on
    one key. Also, the alphabet can have more than 26 letters (it
    is not English).</p>
<p>For reference, the current phone keypad looks like this</p>
<pre>
key 2: abc
key 3: def
key 4: ghi
key 5: jkl
key 6: mno
key 7: pqrs
key 8: tuv
key 9: wxyz
</pre>
<p>The first press of a key types the first letter. Each
    subsequent press advances to the next letter. For example, to
    type the word "snow", you need to press "7" four times,
    followed by "6" twice, followed by "6" three times, followed by
    "9" once. The total number of key presses is 10.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line in the input file contains the number of test
    cases <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 100$</span>.
    This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    cases. Each case consists of two lines. On the first line we
    have the maximum number of letters to place on a key
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq P \leq 1\, 000$</span>),
    the number of keys available (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq K \leq 1\, 000$</span>) and the number of letters in our
    alphabet (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq L \leq \min (
    1\, 000, P\cdot K)$</span>) all separated by single spaces. The
    second line has <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>
    non-negative integers. Each number represents the frequency of
    a certain letter. The first number is how many times the first
    letter is used, the second number is how many times the second
    letter is used, and so on. The frequency of each letter is
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, you should output the following</p>
<pre>
Case #x: [minimum number of keypad presses]
</pre>
<p>indicating the number of keypad presses to type the message
    for the optimal layout.</p>
