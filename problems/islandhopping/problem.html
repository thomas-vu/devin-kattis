<p>You are a contractor for the small independent nation of
    Microisles, which is far out in the Pacific ocean, and made up
    of a large number of islands. The islanders travel between
    islands on boats, but the government has hired you to design a
    set of bridges that would connect all the islands together.
    However, they want to do this at a minimum cost. Cost is
    proportional to bridge length, so they want to minimize the
    total length of all bridges put together. You need to decide
    which bridges should connect which islands.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 10$</span>. After that,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cases follow. Each
    case starts with a line containing the integer number of
    islands <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le 750$</span>,
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each
    containing the real-valued horizontal and vertical position of
    a bridge endpoint for the corresponding island. All bridge
    endpoints are, of course, unique. Each coordinate is in the
    range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-1\, 000$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000]$</span> meters and has
    at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> digits past
    the decimal point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the total length of bridges
    needed to connect all the islands accurate to relative and
    absolute error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span> meters.</p>
