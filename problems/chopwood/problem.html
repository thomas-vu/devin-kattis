<div class="problembody">
<p>Given an unrooted tree structure as in the picture below, we
    chop it into pieces in the following way: pick the smallest
    numbered leaf, and remove the edge connecting that leaf to the
    tree. Then repeat this process until nothing is left of the
    tree.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: An unrooted tree
        </div>
</center>
</div>
<p>To record this process, we write list the edges of the tree
    in the order they were chopped off, and write each edge as
    “<tt class="ttfamily">u</tt> <tt class="ttfamily">v</tt>” where
    <tt class="ttfamily">u</tt> is the leaf and <tt class="ttfamily">v</tt> is its connecting vertex. So for the figure
    above we get:</p>
<pre>
u    v
3    5
4    1
5    1
1    2
6    2
2    7
</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, we lost the first column of data of this
    extremely important list so we only have the “<tt class="ttfamily">v</tt>” column. Can you help us reconstruct the
    “<tt class="ttfamily">u</tt>” column? The vertices of the tree
    are always numbered from 1 up to the number of vertices.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 200\, 000$</span>) giving the length of the list. The
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    contain an integer between 1 and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n+1$</span> (inclusive), describing the
    <tt class="ttfamily">v</tt> column of the list.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the <tt class="ttfamily">u</tt> column can be uniquely
    determined, write <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines of integers giving the <tt class="ttfamily">u</tt> column
    of the list. If the <tt class="ttfamily">u</tt> column can not
    be uniquely determined (either because no tree exists which
    results in the given <tt class="ttfamily">v</tt> column, or
    because many different such trees exist), write a single line
    containing the word “<tt class="ttfamily">Error</tt>”.</p>
<h3>Warning</h3>
<p>This problem has somewhat large amounts of input and output.
    We recommend you to make sure that your output is properly
    buffered, otherwise your solution may be too slow.</p>
