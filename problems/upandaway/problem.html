        Steve’s Retreat
      </div>
</div>
<p>Steve has set up <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    bases on multiple mountains around his house, located at
    mountain <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. He wants to
    fly from one base to another using his elytra and get to his
    vacation house at mountain <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>. Unfortunately, flying from one
    base to another takes time, and he can only do this from a
    taller mountain to a shorter mountain! If mountains are equal
    height, he can fly between them as well.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he has <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    uses of fireworks, meaning he can also travel from a shorter
    mountain to a taller mountain! However, he doesn’t have much
    fireworks, so the total amount of elevation travelled upwards
    using fireworks throughout the whole trip must not exceed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>. Please help Steve
    calculate the fastest time he can reach his vacation house, or
    determine that he can’t!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains three space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n, k \leq 100$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x \leq n$</span>, the
    number of bases, the location of the vacation house and the
    amount of fireworks, respectively.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_1, h_2, \ldots , h_ n$</span>,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq h_ i \leq 100$</span>) is the height
    of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> base’s
    mountain.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers each,
    where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{th}$</span> integer
    on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> of these
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines is the time it
    takes to travel from the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> base to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{th}$</span> base. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> number on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> of these <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines will always be <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. The time between mountains will
    not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If Steve can reach his vacation house, output a single
    integer, the minimum time Steve needs to reach his vacation
    house at base <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>. If he
    cannot reach his vacation house, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
