<p>Thrilled about his new valid set of pieces, Mirko rushed
    over to Slavko’s, to find that Slavko too found a set of chess
    pieces in his attic. Slavko’s set, miraculously, contains only
    black pieces. But since neither of them can play chess, they
    settled on smashing one another senseless with their
    chessboards.</p>
<p>While Slavko is warming up with a series of stretches, Mirko
    decided to sabotage Slavko’s chessboard. An expert in carving
    wood, he decided to cut Slavko’s chessboard so that it shatters
    into <em>as many pieces as possible</em> when Slavko attempts
    to hit Mirko.</p>
<p>Mirko can only make <em>horizontal and vertical cuts</em>
    (parallel to the sides to the board), edge to edge, and has
    time to make <em>at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> cuts</em>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 10^9$</span>), the number of cuts Mirko can make.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the largest number of pieces Slavko’s chessboard can
    crash into.</p>
