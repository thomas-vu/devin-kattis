</div>Your fancy debugger will not help you in this matter.
    There are many ways in which code can produce different
    behavior between debug and release builds, and when this
    happens, one may have to resort to more primitive forms of
    debugging.

    <p>So you and your printf are now on your own in the search for
    a line of code that causes the release build to crash. Still
    you are lucky: adding printf statements to this program affects
    neither the bug (it still crashes at the same original code
    line) nor the execution time (at least not notably). So even
    the naive approach of putting a printf statement before each
    line, running the program until it crashes, and checking the
    last printed line, would work.</p>
<p>However, it takes some time to add each printf statement to
    the code, and the program may have a lot of lines. So perhaps a
    better plan would involve putting a printf statement in the
    middle of the program, letting it run, seeing whether it
    crashes before the added line, and then continuing the search
    in either the first or second half of the code.</p>
<p>But then again, running the program may take a lot of time,
    so the most time-efficient strategy might be something in
    between. Write a program that computes the minimum worst-case
    time to find the crashing line (no matter where it is),
    assuming you choose an optimal strategy for placing your printf
    statements.</p>
<p>Weâ€™re releasing the new version in five hours, so this issue
    is escalated and needs to be fixed ASAP.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one line with three integers:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 10^6$</span>), the number of
        code lines;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le r \le 10^9$</span>), the amount of
        time it takes to compile and run the program until it
        crashes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le p \le 10^9$</span>), the time it
        takes to add a single printf line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You have already run the program once and therefore already
    know that it does crash somewhere.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the worst-case time to find the crashing line when
    using an optimal strategy.</p>
