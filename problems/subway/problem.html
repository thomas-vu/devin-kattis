<p>Some major cities have subway systems in the form of a tree,
    i.e. between any pair of stations, there is one and only one
    way of going by subway. Moreover, most of these cities have a
    unique central station. Imagine you are a tourist in one of
    these cities and you want to explore all of the subway system.
    You start at the central station and pick a subway line at
    random and jump aboard the subway car. Every time you arrive at
    a station, you pick one of the subway lines you have not yet
    travelled on. If there is none left to explore at your current
    station, you take the subway line back on which you first came
    to the station, until you eventually have travelled along all
    of the lines twice, once for each direction. At that point you
    are back at the central station. Afterwards, all you remember
    of the order of your exploration is whether you went further
    away from the central station or back towards it at any given
    time, i.e. you could encode your tour as a binary string, where
    0 encodes taking a subway line getting you one station further
    away from the central station, and 1 encodes getting you one
    station closer to the central station.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line of input is a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, telling the number of
    test scenarios to follow. Each test scenario consists of two
    lines, each containing a string of the characters ’0’ and ’1’
    of length at most 3000, both describing a correct exploration
    tour of a subway tree system.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test scenario, output one line containing the text
    “same” if the two strings may encode exploration tours of the
    same subway tree system, or the text “different” if the two
    strings cannot be exploration tours of the same subway tree
    system.</p>
