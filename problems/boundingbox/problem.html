<p>The Archeologists of the Current Millenium (ACM) now and
    then discover ancient artifacts located at vertices of regular
    polygons. (Recall that an <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-sided regular polygon is a polygon
    where all <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> sides have
    the same lengths, and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> internal angles where two sides
    meet are all equal.)</p>
<p>The moving sand dunes of the desert render the excavations
    difficult and thus once three vertices of a polygon are
    discovered there is a need to cover the entire polygon with
    protective fabric.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains multiple test cases, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>.</p>
<p>Each case describes one polygon. It starts with an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le n \le 50$</span>, the
    number of vertices in the polygon, followed by three pairs of
    real numbers giving the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates of three vertices of
    the polygon. The coordinates have absolute value at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span> and at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> digits after the
    decimal point.</p>
<p>The input ends with a dummy case having <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = 0$</span>, this case should not be
    processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line giving the smallest area
    of a rectangle which can cover all the vertices of the polygon
    and whose sides are parallel to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> axes. You may assume that this
    area is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\,
    000$</span>. Your answers should have an absolute or relative
    error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-9}$</span>.</p>
