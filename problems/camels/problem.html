</div>Jaap, Jan, and Thijs are on a trip to the desert after
    having attended the ACM ICPC World Finals 2015 in Morocco. The
    trip included a camel ride, and after returning from the ride,
    their guide invited them to a big camel race in the evening.
    The camels they rode will also participate and it is customary
    to bet on the results of the race.

    <p>One of the most interesting bets involves guessing the
    complete order in which the camels will finish the race. This
    bet offers the biggest return on your money, since it is also
    the one that is the hardest to get right.</p>
<p>Jaap, Jan, and Thijs have already placed their bets, but the
    race will not start until an hour from now, so they are getting
    bored. They started wondering how many pairs of camels they
    have put in the same order. If camel <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is before camel <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> on Jaap’s, Jan’s and Thijs’ bet,
    it means that all three of them put <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> in the same order. Can you help
    them to calculate the number of pairs of camels for which this
    happened?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq n \leq 200\, 000$</span>), the
        number of camels;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, \ldots , a_
        n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a_ i \le
        n$</span> for all <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>), Jaap’s bet. Here
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1$</span> is the camel in
        the first position of Jaap’s bet, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_2$</span> is the camel in the second
        position, and so on;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with Jan’s bet, in the same format as Jaap’s
        bet;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with Thijs’ bet, in the same format as Jaap’s
        bet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The camels are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1,
    \dots , n$</span>. Each camel appears exactly once in each
    bet.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of pairs of camels that appear in the same
    order in all <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> bets.</p>
