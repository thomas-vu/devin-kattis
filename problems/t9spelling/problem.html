<p>The Latin alphabet contains 26 characters and telephones
    only have ten digits on the keypad. We would like to make it
    easier to write a message to your friend using a sequence of
    keypresses to indicate the desired characters. The letters are
    mapped onto the digits as shown below. To insert the character
    ‘B’ for instance, the program would press “22”. In order to
    insert two characters in sequence from the same key, the user
    must pause before pressing the key a second time. The space
    character ‘ ’ should be printed to indicate a pause. For
    example, “2 2” indicates “AA” whereas “22” indicates “B”.</p>

<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input gives the number of cases,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N, 1 \leq N \leq 100$</span>.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> test cases follow.
    Each case is a line of text containing the desired message,
    which will be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span> characters long. Each message
    will consist of only lowercase characters ‘a’–‘z’ and space
    characters ‘ ’. Pressing zero emits a space.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing “Case
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>: ” followed by the
    message translated into the sequence of key presses.</p>
