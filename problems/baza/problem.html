<p>The longest common prefix of two words is the longest word
    that both words start with. For example, the longest common
    prefix of the words “identity” and “idealistic” is the word
    “ide”. A database contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> words.</p>
<p>The algorithm to search for a query word <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> in the database is primitive. It
    compares the word <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> one
    by one with each word in the database. Two words are compared
    letter by letter until a letter in which they differ is found
    or until the end of one of the words is reached (it is then
    established either that the words are equal or that one is
    longer than the other). When the algorithm finds the word
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> in the database, it
    terminates.</p>
<p>Analysing the algorithm shows that the number of steps
    needed to find a word <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>
    is equal to the number of words <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> is compared to, plus the sum of
    the lengths of the longest common prefixes of W and each of the
    words it was compared to.</p>
<p>Write a program that calculates the number of steps the
    algorithm uses to find each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> query words.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq N \leq 30\, 000)$</span>, the number of words in the
    database. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains a single word from
    the database. The words are given in the order the algorithm
    compares them to a query word. All words in the database will
    be distinct. The following line contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq Q \leq 30\, 000)$</span>, the number
    of words searched for. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines contains a single query
    word.</p>
<p>All words in the input will be strings of less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> lowercase letters of
    the English alphabet</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one integer per line for each query word, the number
    of steps the algorithm uses when searching for the word.</p>
