<div class="problembody">
<p>Consider a square grid with lamps in fixed locations. Each
    lamp can either illuminate its row or its column, but not both.
    The illumination of each lamp extends over a limited
    distance.</p>
<p>Any square in the grid should only be illuminated by at most
    one lamp in its row and by at most one lamp in its column (one
    of each is acceptable, as is just the row, just the column, or
    neither). Determine if it is possible for all lamps to be lit
    while satisfying these constraints.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that
    your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The
    first line of input contains three positive integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n, r, k \le 1\, 000, k \le n^2$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the size of one side of the
    square grid, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is the
    maximum reach of a lamp, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is the number of lamps. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines will each
    contain two positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le i, j \le n$</span>), indicating that there is a lamp in the
    grid at row <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, column
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
<p>Each lamp can illuminate squares at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> units away, and can also
    illuminate its own square, so the maximum number of squares it
    can illuminate is <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 r +
    1$</span>. All lamps will be in distinct locations.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> if it is possible to light all of
    the lamps and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> if it is
    not possible.</p>
