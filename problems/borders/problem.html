<div class="problembody">
<p>Consider a black and white image, where every pixel has a
    value of either 0 or 1. Define a region of the image as a
    collection of pixels that all have the same value, and are
    interconnected. Specifically, for any two pixels in a region,
    there is a path between them only going up, down, left or
    right, and only going through other pixels with the same
    value.</p>
<p>You wish to see a border completely around every region in
    the image. You can choose certain regions to draw a border
    around; when you do, you draw a border around the entire
    region, including any internal “holes” (regions entirely
    contained within the region). If two regions are adjacent, then
    you can supply the border between then by drawing the border
    around one, or the other, or both. What is the minimum number
    of regions you need to draw a border around in order to ensure
    that every region has a border?</p>
<p>Consider these examples:</p>
<div class="figure">
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth ]{borders.png}" src="/problems/borders/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:100.00%"/>
</center>
</div>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>In the first case, the minimum is three. Because they’re
        on the edges, there is no choice but to draw a border
        around all three.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the second case, the minimum is one. Drawing a border
        around the 0 region puts a border around the 1 region.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the third case, the answer is eight. Drawing a border
        around all of the regions on the edges puts a border around
        the center region.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n,m \le 100$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of rows in the
    image, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the
    number of columns.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains a single string of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, consisting only of the characters
    ‘<tt class="tt">0</tt>’ and ‘<tt class="tt">1</tt>’. This is
    the image.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the minimum number of
    regions you must draw a border around to ensure that every
    region has a border.</p>
