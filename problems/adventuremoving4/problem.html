<p>To help you move from Waterloo to the big city, you are
    considering renting a moving truck. Gas prices being so high
    these days, you want to know how much the gas for such a beast
    will set you back.</p>
<p>The truck consumes a full litre of gas for each kilometre it
    travels. It has a 200 litre gas tank. When you rent the truck
    in Waterloo, the tank is half full. When you return it in the
    big city, the tank must be at least half full, or you’ll get
    gouged even more for gas by the rental company. You would like
    to spend as little as possible on gas, but you don’t want to
    run out along the way.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input is all integers. The first integer is the distance in
    kilometres from Waterloo to the big city, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>. Next comes a set of up to
    100 gas station specifications, describing all the gas stations
    along your route, in non-decreasing order by distance. Each
    specification consists of the distance in kilometres of the gas
    station from Waterloo, and the price of a litre of gas at the
    gas station, in tenths of a cent, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output is the minimum amount of money that you can spend on
    gas to get you from Waterloo to the big city. If it is not
    possible to get from Waterloo to the big city without running
    out of gas along the way, output “Impossible”.</p>
