<p>Nathan is a mathematician at a famous university who often
    sees patterns in the world around him. One day he notices that
    his office number, which happens to be <span class="tex2jax_process">$224$</span>, has an interesting property: it
    can be written as a sum of non-negative powers of its digits.
    In particular, he observes that</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 224 = 2^5 + 2^7 + 4^3 \]</span>
<p>Nathan wonders what other numbers have this property, and,
    for any such number, in how many different ways it can be
    expressed like this. More precisely, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is a positive integer with
    <span class="mbox" style="width:">base-<span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span></span> digits <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_1 d_2 \ldots d_ k$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_1$</span> is the most
    significant digit, he would like to know how many tuples of
    non-negative integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$(e_1, e_2,
    \ldots , e_ k)$</span> there are such that</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ n = d_1^{e_1} + d_2^{e_2} + \ldots + d_
    k^{e_ k} \]</span>
<p>For <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=224$</span>, the answer
    is <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, since the tuples
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(5,7,3)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(7,5,3)$</span> both work, but no others
    do.</p>
<p>Nathan has turned to you for help with this challenge. Since
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0^ e = 0$</span> for any
    positive exponent, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1^ e =
    1$</span> for any non-negative exponent, you only need to
    consider numbers with digits in <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 2, 3, \ldots , 9\} $</span>. Remember
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$p^0 = 1$</span> for any
    positive integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single positive integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 &lt; n &lt; 10\, 000\, 000$</span>. Each
    digit of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer: the number of ways <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> can be written as a sum of
    non-negative integer powers of its digits.</p>
