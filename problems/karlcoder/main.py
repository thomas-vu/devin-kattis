Here's the solution in Python 3 that Karl can use to efficiently recover the size of the string `N` without crashing his program:

```python
import sys

def find_n(max_reads):
    low, high = 1, max_reads
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        reads = [f"buf[{i}]" for i in range(mid)]
        sys.stdout.write("\n".join(reads) + "\n")
        responses = [input() for _ in range(len(reads))]
        
        zero_found = False
        for resp in responses:
            if resp == "0":
                zero_found = True
                break
        
        if zero_found:
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    
    return low

max_reads = int(sys.argv[1]) if len(sys.argv) > 1 else int(2 * (sys.log2(10**18)))
N = find_n(max_reads)
sys.stdout.write(f"strlen(buf) = {N}\n")
```

This script uses a binary search to efficiently find the size of the string `N` by reading bytes from the buffer until it finds a zero byte. The script reads up to `2 * log2(N)` bytes, where `log2` is the base-2 logarithm. If a zero byte is found during this process, the search space for `N` is reduced by half; otherwise, it expands. The process continues until the correct value of `N` is determined, ensuring that the program does not attempt to read more bytes than allowed.
