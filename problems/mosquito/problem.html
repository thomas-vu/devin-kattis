</div>Have you ever wondered why there are so many mosquitoes
    in wet environments? One of the reasons is that adult female
    mosquitos can lay as many as hundreds of eggs. Even if most of
    them do not (fortunately!) survive, it is said that
    a single pair of mosquitoes can generate a population
    of thousands in just a couple of weeks. Let us have
    a closer look at these numbers.

    <p>The mosquito life cycle includes four stages: egg, larva,
    pupa, and adult. For simplicity, we will make several
    assumptions that are not quite true in the nature: The egg
    stage lasts less than one day, and all the other stages are one
    week long. Each mosquito lives as a larva for the first
    week, the second week “hibernates” in the form of a pupa,
    and finally, the third week lives as an adult mosquito. At
    the end of its three-week life, each mosquito lays eggs and
    dies.</p>
<p>To simplify things even further, we will assume that the
    transformation from one life stage into another always happens
    on Sunday. Each Sunday, the following things happen:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>An adult mosquito lays <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> eggs and dies. Within
        a day, one larva hatches from each egg.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some of the larvae hatched from egg the last Sunday were
        not strong enough and died or got eaten. Only every
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>-th larva will
        transform into a pupa on Sunday.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An adult mosquito emerges from every <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>-th pupa, all other pupae
        dry.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if there are 5 pupae and every 3-rd of them
    survives, there will be 1 mosquito left. Out of 6 pupae, two
    adult mosquitoes emerge.</p>
<p>In the first week, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> mosquitoes, <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> pupae and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> larvae. Calculate how many
    mosquitoes will there be after <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> Sunday transformations. Of course,
    we are counting only living <em>adult</em> mosquitos, not the
    dry dead bodies.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several instances, each instance per
    one line. Each line contains seven integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> separated by space. <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> are the numbers of mosquitoes,
    pupae, and larvae, respectively, in the first week. You may
    assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le M, P, L \le
    100\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le E \le
    100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le R, S \le
    10$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le N\le 1\,
    000$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> is the
    number of eggs laid by one mosquito, <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> specify the survival rates of
    larvae and pupae, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    is the number of weeks.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input instance, output a single line containing an
    integer number <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, giving
    the count of mosquitoes after the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>-th Sunday.</p>
<p>You may assume that the number of mosquitoes during each of
    the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> weeks will
    not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\,
    000$</span>.</p>
