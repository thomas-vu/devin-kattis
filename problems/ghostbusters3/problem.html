<div class="problembody">
<p>There is something strange in the neighbourhood. Who you
    gonna call? Ghostbusters!</p>
<p>A number of ghosts have decided to roam the street, and the
    Ghostbusters have arrived to deal with this situation. Luckily
    all the ghosts have decided to stay on one side of a very long
    street, so it is safe for the Ghostbusters to stand on the
    opposite side of the street to aim and fire their particle
    beams at the ghosts. Each Ghostbuster must aim at exactly one
    ghost, and it is important that the beams do not cross. Two
    beams are not considered to be crossing each other if they are
    both aimed at the same ghost.</p>
<p>How many ways are there to assign ghosts to the
    Ghostbusters, so that as many ghosts as possible are assigned
    to some Ghostbuster? Of course, no two beams can cross each
    other. As the answer may be very large, please report the
    answer modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9+7$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There is one line of input containing two integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le n\le 1\, 000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le m\le 1\, 000$</span>, indicated the
    number of Ghostbusters and the number of ghosts,
    respectively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the total number of ways ghosts can be assigned to
    Ghostbusters as described in the problem statement, modulo
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9+7$</span>.</p>
