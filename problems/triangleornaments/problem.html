</div>A company makes triangle-shaped ornaments for the
    upcoming holidays. Each ornament is tied at one of its corners
    to a rod using a string of unknown length. Multiple of these
    ornaments may be attached to the same rod. These ornaments
    should be able to swing (rotate around the axis formed by the
    string) without interfering with each other.

    <p>Write a program that computes the minimum required length
    for the rod, given a list of triangles!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line
    contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; N \le 100$</span>),
    denoting the number of triangles. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each contain three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A, B, C$</span> denoting the
    lengths of the three sides of each triangle. The triangle will
    hang from the corner between sides <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. You are guaranteed that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A, B, C$</span> form a triangle
    that has an area that is strictly greater than zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the required length <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> such that all triangles can be
    hung from the rod, no matter how long or short each triangle’s
    string is. No triangle should swing beyond the rod’s ends. You
    may ignore the thickness of each ornament, the width of the
    string and you may assume that the string is attached exactly
    to the triangle’s end point.</p>
<p>Your answer should be accurate to within an absolute or
    relative error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span>.</p>
