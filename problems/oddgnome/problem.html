<p>According to the legend of Wizardry and Witchcraft, gnomes
    live in burrows underground, known as gnome holes. There they
    dig up and eat the roots of plants, creating little heaps of
    earth around gardens, causing considerable damage to them.</p>
<p>Mrs. W, very annoyed by the damage, has to regularly
    de-gnome her garden by throwing the gnomes over the fence. It
    is a lot of work to throw them one by one because there are so
    many. Fortunately, the species is so devoted to their kings
    that each group always follows its king no matter what. In
    other words, if she were to throw just the king over the fence,
    all the other gnomes in that group would leave.</p>
<p>So how does Mrs. W identify the king in a group of gnomes?
    She knows that gnomes travel in a certain order, and the king,
    being special, is always the only gnome who does not follow
    that order.</p>
<p>Here are some helpful tips about gnome groups:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>There is exactly one king in a group.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Except for the king, gnomes arrange themselves in
        strictly increasing ID order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The king is always the only gnome out of that order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The king is never the first nor the last in the group,
        because kings like to hide themselves.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Help Mrs. W by finding all the kings!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100$</span>, representing the
    number of gnome groups. Each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> following lines contains one group
    of gnomes, starting with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq g \leq 1\, 000$</span>, representing
    the number of gnomes in that group. Following on the same line
    are <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> space-separated
    integers, representing the gnome ordering. Within each group
    all the integers (including the king) are unique and in the
    range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0,10\, 000]$</span>.
    Excluding the king, each integer is exactly one more than the
    integer preceding it.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each group, output the kingâ€™s position in the group
    (where the first gnome in line is number one).</p>
