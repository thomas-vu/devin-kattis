<div class="problembody">
<p>Nikolaj works at a company that sells a large number of
    products. Each product has a product ID, which is a large
    integer. For error detection, in particular in connection with
    manual database entry, it would be useful if each product also
    had a single “check” digit between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> that can be quickly computed from
    the product ID. Nikolaj has been tasked with implementing this.
    He recently solved the problem “Digit Product” on Open Kattis
    and considers using the procedure described there.</p>
<p>He recalls that the idea is to start with a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and repeatedly
    multiply all its nonzero digits, until only a single digit is
    left. For instance, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
    is <span class="tex2jax_process">$808$</span> then the
    resulting digit is <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>,
    because <span class="tex2jax_process">$8 \cdot 8 = 64$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6 \cdot 4 = 24$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \cdot 4 = 8$</span>.</p>
<p>However, Nikolaj is unsure about using this method, because
    the distribution of resulting digits seems uneven to him. To
    determine how the distribution looks, he writes a program that
    given two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> determines how many
    numbers in the interval <span class="tex2jax_process">$[L,
    R]$</span> result in each digit.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>A single line consisting of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq L \leq R \leq 10^{15}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_9$</span>
    on a single line. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th number <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> is the number of integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> satisfying
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L \leq x \leq R$</span> such
    that repeated multiplication of the nonzero digits of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> results in the digit
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
