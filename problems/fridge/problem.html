<p>The technology behind the fridge has changed little over the
    years. Even so, many of the original owners of the Fred W. Wolf
    domestic refrigerator of 1913 would be amazed by the size and
    features of the modern appliances. However, since the 1960s one
    thing has been common for all fridge owners around the world:
    fridge magnets.</p>
<p>An effective, albeit lazy, way to keep a small child
    entertained is to supply them with a set of magnetic numbers
    and a large magnetic surface, such as said fridge, to provide
    the playing field upon which to apply these digits.</p>
<p>Far from a time-wasting exercise, this provides valuable
    training in the mathematical field of <em>counting</em>: moving
    the digits around to form “1”, “2”, and so on up to such
    heights as “10”, “11”, “12”, and even beyond.</p>
<p>The possibilities are endless! ...Or at least, they would
    be, if the supply of digits was not limited. Given the full
    list of what numbers we are in possession of, what is the
    smallest positive number that <em>cannot</em> be made using
    each of digits at most once?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One string of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span> digits, containing the
        available digits in no particular order.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing one positive integer: the smallest
        natural number that it is not possible to assemble from the
        supplied digits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
