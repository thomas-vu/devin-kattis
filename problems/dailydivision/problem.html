<p>Oostende Beach is a very long beach located in the north of
    Belgium. On this beach, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> huts located along a straight
    line. People can rent a room in one of those huts to spend
    their beach vacations together with the other tenants.</p>
<p>Every day at lunch time, a food truck drives by to serve
    fries to the guests. The truck parks in front of one of the
    huts and people form two queues. The people staying in huts to
    the left of the food truck queue on the left, and the people to
    the right of the food truck queue on the right. The people
    staying in the hut in front of the food truck split their group
    in half, one half going to the left queue and the other half
    going to the right queue. If this is an odd number of people,
    the remaining person will go to the queue with fewer people, or
    choose one randomly if the queues have the same length. The
    food truck always positions itself so that the difference
    between the number of people in the left queue and the number
    of people in the right queue is as small as possible.</p>
<p>Each night the number of guests in exactly one of the huts
    changes. Can you help the food truck find the best position for
    each day?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line of the input consists of two integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n \leq 10^5$</span>,
        the number of huts, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq q\leq 10^5$</span>, the number of
        days.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second line has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_0$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\dots $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{n-1}$</span> satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq a_ i \leq 10^6$</span> for
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq i &lt; n$</span>,
        where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> is the
        current number of people in hut <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>
        lines with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq i&lt;n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq x \leq 10^6$</span>. The
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^\textrm {th}$</span> of
        these lines indicates that at day <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> the number of people in hut
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> changes to
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Print <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines:
        the optimal position of the food truck after each of the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> nights. If there
        are multiple optimal positions, print the smallest one.</p>
