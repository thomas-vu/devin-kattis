<p>For over 600 years, the hourglass has been a well-known
    timekeeping instrument. An hourglass consists of two glass
    flasks arranged one above the other which are connected by a
    narrow channel. Inside the hourglass there is sand which slowly
    flows from the upper to the lower flask. Hourglasses are
    typically symmetrical so that the sand always takes the same
    amount of time to run through, regardless of orientation. For
    the purposes of this problem, we also assume that the flow rate
    of the sand is a known constant and does not depend on the
    amount or distribution of sand in the upper half.</p>
<p>Your friend Helen was bored and has been playing around with
    her hourglass. At time <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, all the sand was in the lower
    half. Helen flipped the hourglass over several times and
    recorded all the moments at which she did so. How many seconds
    does she need to wait from the current time until all the sand
    is back in the lower half?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>
            (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le t \le
            10^6$</span>) is the current time;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
            (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le s \le
            10^6$</span>) is the amount of sand in the hourglass,
            in grams;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
            (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1\,
            000$</span>) is the number of times the hourglass was
            flipped.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1,\dots ,a_
        n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; a_1 &lt;
        \dots &lt; a_ n &lt; t$</span>), the times at which the
        hourglass was flipped.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All times are given in seconds. You may assume that the sand
    flows from the top to the bottom at a constant rate of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> gram per second.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the time in seconds needed for the hourglass to run
    out starting from time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>.</p>
