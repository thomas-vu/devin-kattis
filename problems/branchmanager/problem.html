<div class="problembody">
<p>You are managing a transportation network of one-way roads
    between cities. People travel through the transportation
    network one by one in order all starting from the same city,
    and each person waits for the person before them to stop moving
    before starting. The people follow a simple algorithm until
    they reach their destination: they will look at all the
    outgoing roads from the current city, and choose the one that
    leads to the city with the smallest label. A person will stop
    when they either reach their destination, or reach a city with
    no outgoing roads. If at any point someone fails to reach their
    destination, the rest of the people still waiting in line will
    leave.</p>
<p>Before each person enters the transportation network, you
    can permanently close down any subset of roads to guarantee
    they reach their destination. The roads that you choose to
    close down will not be available for future people.</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cities,
    labeled from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. There are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> directed roads, and
    each road will always be from a lower labeled city to a higher
    labeled one. The network will form a rooted tree with city
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> as the root. There are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> people that want to
    travel through the network. Each person starts from city
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and has a specific
    destination city <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> in
    mind. These people will line up in the given order. What is the
    maximum number of people you can route correctly to their
    destination if you close roads optimally?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le n,m \le 2 \times 10^5$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of cities and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number of
    people.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>
    lines contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le a &lt; b \le n$</span>), denoting a directed road from city
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. These roads will describe a
    rooted tree with city <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    as the root.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le d \le n$</span>), denoting the destination city of the next
    person in line.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the maximum number of
    people you can route to the correct destination.</p>
