<p>The small sawmill in Mission, British Columbia, has
    developed a brand new way of packaging boards for drying. By
    fixating the boards in special moulds, the board can dry
    efficiently in a drying room.</p>
<p>Space is an issue though. The boards cannot be too close,
    because then the drying will be too slow. On the other hand,
    one wants to use the drying room efficiently.</p>
<p>Looking at it from a 2-D perspective, your task is to
    calculate the fraction between the space occupied by the boards
    to the total space occupied by the mould. Now, the mould is
    surrounded by an aluminium frame of negligible thickness,
    following the hull of the boardsâ€™ corners tightly. The space
    occupied by the mould would thus be the interior of the
    frame.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line of input there is one integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \le 50$</span>, giving the
    number of test cases (moulds) in the input. After this line,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> test cases follow.
    Each test case starts with a line containing one integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 600$</span>, which is the number
    of boards in the mould. Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines follow, each with five
    floating point numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x, y, w,
    h, v$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x, y,
    w, h \le 10\, 000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$-90^{\circ } &lt; v \le 90^{\circ }$</span>.
    The <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> are the coordinates of the center
    of the board and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> are the width and
    height of the board, respectively. <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> is the angle between the height
    axis of the board to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-axis in degrees, positive
    clockwise. That is, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$v =
    0$</span>, the projection of the board on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>. Of course, the boards cannot
    intersect.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For every test case, output one line containing the fraction
    of the space occupied by the boards to the total space in
    percent. Your output should have one decimal digit and be
    followed by a space and a percent sign (%).</p>
