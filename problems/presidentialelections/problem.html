<p>In a few weeks time, a new president will be elected in the
    country of Marecia. There are two political parties: the
    Constituents and the Federals. Each party has one presidential
    candidate; one of these will become the new president.</p>
<p>This year you are more involved than ever before: you are
    the candidate for the Constituents! With only a few weeks to
    go, you decide to take stock of the situation. Instead of
    touring blindly through the country, you feel that it is better
    to focus your attention on certain particular states.</p>
<p>The Marecian electoral system is quite complicated. Every
    registered voter will vote for exactly one of the two
    candidates, but the totals are not calculated nationwide.
    Instead, every state has a fixed number of delegates. After the
    popular vote is in, the delegates from all states travel by
    foot to the capital of Marecia, the city of Ashwington. One
    final round of voting is done in Ashwington: every delegate
    gets to vote for one of the two candidates. A delegate is
    required by law to vote for the candidate who received the
    majority of the votes in his own home state.</p>
<p>Your campaign team has painstakingly compiled a very
    accurate list of voting preferences per state. Therefore you
    now have the following information about every state:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The number of voters who will definitely vote for the
        Constituents;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of voters who will certainly vote for the
        Federals;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of voters who have not made up their minds
        yet.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Voters from the first two categories are not susceptible to
    any further campaigning, so your focus for the remaining weeks
    is on people of the third category. Specifically, you would
    like to know the minimum number of people you still have to
    convince in order to secure a victory.</p>
<p>If there is a tie on either state or national level, the law
    states that it is resolved in favour of the oldest of the two
    political parties, which unfortunately is the Federal
    party.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, the number of states.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> lines
    each contain four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_
    i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ i$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$U_ i$</span>, where</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ i$</span> denotes the
        number of delegates for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th state,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ i$</span> denotes the
        number of registered voters in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th state who will definitely
        vote for the Constituents,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$F_ i$</span> denotes the
        number of registered voters in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th state who will certainly
        vote for the Federals,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$U_ i$</span> denotes the
        number of undecided voters in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th state.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2016$</span> delegates in total, and the
    total number of registered voters is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>. Every state has at least one
    delegate and at least one registered voter. There is at least
    one state.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with a single integer: the minimum number of
    voters you have to convince to secure a victory. If it is not
    possible for you to win the election, output “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>” instead.</p>
