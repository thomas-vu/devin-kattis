<div class="problembody">
<p>Pichuu, the Pokemon Master, faced a dilemma after destroying
    Team Galactic, becoming the champion and catching every
    legendary Pokemon. He realized he had lost his town map, a
    precious item given to him by his mother and also a Key Item!
    To avoid her scolding, Pichuu decided to reconstruct the
    map.<br/></p>
<p>The town map was originally a bidirectional connected graph
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> towns, each
    labeled distinctly from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, where there was exactly one path
    between any two towns. Pichuu, unfortunately, forgot the direct
    connections between towns. While distraught, he discovered a
    useful feature on his trusty Poketch â€“ it recorded the paths he
    took.<br/></p>
<p>However, for each path from town <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to town <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, the Poketch only recorded the
    town with the minimum label on the path, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_{i, j}$</span>. (The Poketch Company is
    still working out the bugs). For example, if the path on the
    map was <span class="tex2jax_process">$4 \to 2 \to 3 \to
    5$</span>, the Poketch will record <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> for the path from <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span><br/></p>
<p>Working with what he got, Pichuu trys to reconstruct a fake
    Town Map that satisfies the records made by the Poketch. Pichuu
    however is a Pokemon Master, not a Graph Master. Please help
    him recover his town map.<br/></p>
<p>Namely, construct a tree that satisfies the condition that
    the minimum label on the path from town <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_{i, j}$</span></p>
<h2>Constraints</h2>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq
    1500$</span>.<br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq A_{i, j} \leq
    N$</span></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of towns.<br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines follows, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space-separated
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_{i, 1} A_{i, 2}
    \dots A_{i, N}$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_{i, j}$</span> is the town with the
    smallest label on the path from town <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.<br/>
    It is guaranteed there exists a solution given the provided
    values.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> lines,
    each with two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i B_ i$</span> representing an edge in
    your reconstructed town map.</p>
