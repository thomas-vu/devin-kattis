<p>Han didn’t want to study solo so he invited his friend
    Dominik to come over. After an eventful evening that will be
    remembered for a record number of solved tasks from the field
    of electronics, Dominik went home. To his surprise, the police
    stopped him thinking he was drunk. It is known that in these
    situations sobriety is proven by solving a series of carefully
    crafted tasks that test a man’s cognitive abilities. If we can
    trust Dominik, the conversation went something like this:</p>
<dl class="description">
<dt>Policeman</dt>
<dd>
<p>Something easy to begin with… What is the
        complexity of bubble sort?</p>
</dd>
<dt>Dominik</dt>
<dd>
<p>That is really easy, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathrm{O}(n^2)$</span>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Policeman</dt>
<dd>
<p>Say the English alphabet in reverse.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Dominik</dt>
<dd>
<p>Trivial, zyxwvutsrqponmlkjihgfedcba.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Policeman</dt>
<dd>
<p>You learned that by heart. Now imagine that all the
        letters of the English alphabet from ‘a’ to ‘z’ are
        respectively written clockwise in a circle. Begin with the
        letter ‘a’ and say the letters clockwise. After each spoken
        letter, I can tell you to continue saying the alphabet in
        reverse order or I can ask you how many times so far you’ve
        said a certain letter. Are you ready? 3, 2, 1, Go!</p>
</dd>
<dt>Dominik</dt>
<dd>
<p>Um… a, b, c…</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Write a programme that solves Dominik’s problem.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq Q \leq 100\, 000$</span>), the number of policeman’s
    orders. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines contains one of the
    policeman’s order in the form of “<tt class="ttfamily">SMJER</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>”
    (Croatian for direction) or “<tt class="ttfamily">UPIT</tt>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>” (Croatian for query). The order
    in the form “<tt class="ttfamily">SMJER</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>” means that, after the nth spoken
    letter, Dominik must start saying the alphabet in reverse,
    whereas the order in the form “<tt class="ttfamily">UPIT</tt>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>” means that Dominik must say how
    many times so far he’s said the letter <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> in the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> spoken letters.</p>
<p>The policeman’s order will be given chronologically in the
    input, or, the numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10^9 $</span>)
    from the orders will be strictly ascending. The character
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> from the order in the
    form of “<tt class="ttfamily">UPIT</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>” is a lowercase letter of the
    English alphabet.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each order in the form of “<tt class="ttfamily">UPIT</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>”, output how many
    times Dominik has said the letter <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> in the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> spoken letters. The answer to each
    query needs to be written in a separate line, and the queries
    need to be answered in the order given in the input.</p>
