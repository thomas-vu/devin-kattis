</div>If you are familiar with the game 2048, this problem may
    make sense right away.

    <p>Either way, we will define our own one-dimensional version
    of the game:</p>
<p>You are given a list of numbers containing only powers of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>. You can “compress”
    this list by “pushing” it to the right. If two identical
    numbers are next to each other, push will cause them to merge.
    The “merge” in this context means that the two numbers are
    replaced by their sum. Each number can be merged only once—if
    they can merge with either of their neighbors, they merge with
    the one to the right. This process is evaluated from the right.
    For example, the list <span class="tex2jax_process">$[2, 2, 2,
    2]$</span> will become <span class="tex2jax_process">$[4,4]$</span> after one push. For another
    example, given a list <span class="tex2jax_process">$[2,2,2]$</span>, after a push, we end up
    with a new list <span class="tex2jax_process">$[2, 4]$</span>
    and we cannot change it further by “pushing”.</p>
<p>Now, some of these lists, after some number of pushes, may
    end up with a single element. Using the example: <span class="tex2jax_process">$[8, 2, 2, 4] \Rightarrow [8, 4, 4]
    \Rightarrow [8, 8] \Rightarrow [16]$</span>.</p>
<p>If the list can be reduced to a single element list only by
    “pushing”, we call such a list <b class="bfseries">nice</b>.</p>
<p>Your task is to take a given list and make it <b class="bfseries">nice</b> by adding some (maybe zero) elements from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 2, 4, 8\} $</span>. To make
    this problem a bit easier, the initial list can contain only
    numbers in the set <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 2, 4, 8\}
    $</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 100$</span> indicating
    the number of test cases. Next <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines each contains a string of
    length <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq L \leq
    100$</span>, composed entirely of digits from the set
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 2, 4, 8\} $</span> (our
    representation of the given list).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing the shortest
    <b class="bfseries">nice</b> list built out of the input list
    by inserting zero or more of digits from the set <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 2, 4, 8\} $</span>. If there are multiple
    optimal solutions, output the lexicographically smallest
    one.</p>
