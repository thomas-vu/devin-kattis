<em>The prototypical computer adventure game, first designed
      by Will Crowther on the PDP-10 in the mid-1970s as an attempt
      at computer-refereed fantasy gaming, and expanded into a
      puzzle-oriented game by Don Woods at Stanford in 1976. (Woods
      had been one of the authors of INTERCAL.) Now better known as
      Adventure or Colossal Cave Adventure, but the TOPS-10
      operating system permitted only six-letter filenames in

<p>It has recently been discovered how to run open-source
    software on the Y-Crate gaming device. A number of enterprising
    designers have developed Advent-style games for deployment on
    the Y-Crate. Your job is to test a number of these designs to
    see which are winnable.</p>
<p>Each game consists of a set of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> rooms. One of the rooms is the
    start and one of the rooms is the finish. Each room has an
    energy value between <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$+1000$</span>. One-way doorways interconnect
    pairs of rooms.</p>
<p>The player begins in the start room with <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> energy points. She may pass
    through any doorway that connects the room she is in to another
    room, thus entering the other room. The energy value of this
    room is added to the player’s energy. This process continues
    until she wins by entering the finish room or dies by running
    out of energy (or quits in frustration). During her adventure
    the player may enter the same room several times, receiving its
    energy each time.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several test cases (at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>). Each test case
    begins with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the
    number of rooms. The rooms are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> (the start room) to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (the finish room). Input for the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> rooms follows. The
    input for each room consists of one or more lines
    containing:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>the energy value for room <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the number of doorways leaving room <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a list of the rooms that are reachable by the doorways
        leaving room <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The start and finish rooms will always have energy level
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. A line containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> follows the last test
    case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>In one line for each case, output “winnable” if it is
    possible for the player to win, otherwise output
    “hopeless”.</p>
