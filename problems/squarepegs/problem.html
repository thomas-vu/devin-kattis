<p>Mr. Johnson likes to build houses. In fact, he likes it so
    much that he has built a lot of houses that he has not yet
    placed on plots. He has recently acquired <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> circular plots. The city
    government has decided that there can be only one house on each
    plot, and a house cannot touch the boundary of the plot.</p>
<p>Mr. Johnson has <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    circular houses and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    square houses. Help him figure out how many of the plots he can
    fill with houses so that he can get some money back on his
    investments.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>. The second line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space-separated
    integers, where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text
    {th}}$</span> integer denotes the radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i$</span> of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> plot. The third line
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    space-separated integers, where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> integer denotes the
    radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i$</span> of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> circular
    house. The fourth line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> space-separated integers, where
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span>
    integer denotes the side length <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> square house.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the largest number of plots he can fill with
    houses.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N, M, K, r_ i, s_
        i \leq 100$</span></p>
</li>
