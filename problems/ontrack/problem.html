<div class="problembody">
<p>Acmar and Ibmar are at war! You are in charge of a rail
    network that transports important supplies throughout the great
    state of Acmar during this delicate time. The rail system is
    made up of a set of rail lines which meet at various junction
    points. While there is no limit to the number of rail lines
    that can meet at a junction, the network is set up so that
    there is only one path between any two junctions. You’ve tried
    to argue for some redundancy in the system, i.e., extra rail
    lines so that there are two or more paths connecting some
    junctions, but it’s wartime and budgets are tight.</p>
<p>However, this may soon change as you’ve just been given some
    terrible news from double agents working in Ibmar: within the
    next month enemy spies plan to blow up one of the junctions!
    Unfortunately, the exact junction is not known, but knowing
    your enemy well you are certain that they will undoubtedly
    strike the <em>critical junction</em>, specifically the
    junction whose removal disconnects the most pairs of other
    remaining junctions in the system. You don’t have much time to
    act, so the most you can do is add one new line connecting two
    currently unconnected junctions, thereby reducing the number of
    disconnected pairs after the critical junction has been
    destroyed. Your job is to determine how to make the number of
    disconnected pairs as small as possible by adding in the best
    possible rail line.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n \leq 10\, 000$</span>) indicating the number of rail
    lines in the system. Following that are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines of the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$i_1$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$i_2$</span> indicating that a rail line
    connects junctions <span class="tex2jax_process">$i_1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$i_2$</span>. Junctions are
    numbered consecutively starting at <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. All rail lines are two-way and no
    rail line appears more than once in the input. There is exactly
    one path between any two junction points given in the
    input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display two values <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_2$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_1$</span> is the number of pairs of
    junctions which will be disconnected when the enemy destroys
    the critical junction, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_2$</span> is the number of pairs of
    junctions still disconnected after you add in the best possible
    rail line. There will never be more than one critical
    junction.</p>
