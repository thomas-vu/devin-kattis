<p>Many couples will dine out on Valentine’s day. To serve as
    many customers as possible, a particular Western restaurant
    adopts the "Staggered Seating" strategy on the night of
    Valentine’s day.</p>
<p>The strategy works as follows: The restaurant divides its
    opening hours into <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    non-overlapping time intervals, called a *wave*. In each wave,
    a group of customers are served and they must complete their
    meal (and leave the restaurant) within that time interval. Two
    intervals are said to be non-overlapping if the ending time of
    the first interval is not later than the starting time of the
    second interval (in chronological order).</p>
<p>The manager drafted the schedule of each wave. However, you
    discovered that some intervals are extremely short - customers
    are unable to enjoy the meal given the limited time.</p>
<p>You decided to come up with a better schedule, with the
    following conditions:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>The amended time interval for each wave must be
        inclusive of the original time interval of that wave.
        Informally speaking, you are only allowed to extend the
        time intervals. Customers will feel unhappy if the time
        intervals are shortened.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The opening and closing time of the restaurant remains
        unchanged. That is, you cannot change the starting time of
        the first interval or the ending time of the last
        interval.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You would like to maximize the length of the shortest
        time interval across all waves.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Can you help the manager to come up with a better
    schedule?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of a single positive
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2 \leq N \leq 200)$</span>.</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines follow. Each
    line consists of a time interval in the format <tt class="ttfamily">HH:MM - HH:MM</tt>. It is guaranteed that the time
    intervals are non-overlapping and given in chronological
    order.</p>
<p>It is also guaranteed that the time intervals are all within
    the same day, between <tt class="ttfamily">16:00</tt> and
    <tt class="ttfamily">23:59</tt> (inclusive).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, the
    amended schedule of the staggered seating plan. The format
    should be exactly same as that in the input.</p>
<p>If there are multiple solutions, you may output any of
    them.</p>
