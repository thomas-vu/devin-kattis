<p>Barr the Bear is playing the game <i class="itshape">Bits</i> with Swanky Shen!</p>
<p>Bits is a very simple game. At the start, a circle of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> non-negative integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ N$</span> is shown to both players. That
    is, to the left of the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> is the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_{i-1}$</span> if <span class="tex2jax_process">$i &gt; 1$</span>; and the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ N$</span> otherwise. To the
    right of the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_
    i$</span> is the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_{i+1}$</span> if <span class="tex2jax_process">$i &lt; N$</span>; and the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_1$</span> otherwise. Also an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> is given to
    both players.</p>
<p>To win this game, one must divide the circle of integers
    into exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    contiguous non-empty sections, such that the bitwise <tt class="ttfamily">AND</tt> of the <i class="itshape">powers</i> of all
    sections is maximized. The power of a contiguous section of
    integers is the bitwise <tt class="ttfamily">OR</tt> of all
    integers in that section.</p>
<p>Barr the Bear is lazy and knows that you are wise with bits.
    Hence, he has hired you to help him to win the game!</p>
<p><b class="bfseries">Note:</b> The binary bitwise operators
    <tt class="ttfamily">OR</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">AND</tt>
    operate on the base-<span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    representation of the integers and correspond to the operators
    <tt class="ttfamily">|</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">&amp;</tt>
    respectively in C++ or Java.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq K \leq N \leq 5\cdot 10^5$</span>), namely the number of
    integers and the number of contiguous non-empty sections
    required.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> of which is the
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq A_ i \leq
    10^9$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer in one line: The maximum bitwise
    <tt class="ttfamily">AND</tt> of the powers of the sections in
    an optimal division of the circle of integers.</p>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>In the first sample, the circle is <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 3, 4, 1)$</span>. A possible division is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3, 4)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 2)$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3, 4)$</span> has power <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 2)$</span> has power <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. The bitwise <tt class="ttfamily">AND</tt> of <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. Note that a section can possibly
    wrap around the circle.</p>
<p>In the second sample, a possible division is <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 2, 4)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(4)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(4, 2)$</span>. The sectionsâ€™ powers are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> respectively, which have bitwise
    <tt class="ttfamily">AND</tt> of <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>. Note that we require the sections
    to be contiguous integers, so the division <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 4)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 4)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 4)$</span> is not permissible.</p>
<p>In the third sample, we can only have one section. This
    section will have all the integers, and thus have power
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>.</p>
