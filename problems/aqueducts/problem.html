<p>After conquering Britannia, the great Roman general Agricola
    decided all of his new cities should take advantage of the
    natural springs found aplenty. He appointed his advisor Wessus
    Waterus to try to find a way to get each town a fresh supply of
    water.</p>
<p>There are many springs and many towns and between each are
    the natural hills and valleys of Roman Britain. Wessus doesnâ€™t
    want to waste the Imperial coin. He has been tasked with
    linking each town to a spring by a series of aqueducts using as
    little material as possible. Water, as we know, only flows
    downhill so any aqueduct must go from a higher point to a
    lower; intervening hills, springs and towns are no problem
    since they can be tunnelled through and on. The only
    requirement is that all aqueduct components start and end on
    hilltops.</p>
<p>Any spring must only serve one town, but the Romans are
    clever enough to find a way for aqueducts to pass each other.
    Roman engineering is excellent, but has its limits: aqueducts
    can only be of a limited length.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing four integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$n,s,t$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; n \le 500$</span> is the number
        of hills, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le s \le
        40$</span> is the number of springs, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le t \le s$</span> is the number of
        towns and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le q \le 3\cdot
        10^6$</span>) is the maximum aqueduct length.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> more lines,
        each giving the space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i, y_ i, h_ i$</span>: the
        coordinates and height of a hill (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le |x|, |y|, h \le 10^6$</span>).
        These hills are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> in the order given.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> space-separated integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i_ j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i_ j \le n$</span>), each
        representing the number of a hill on which a spring can be
        found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> space-separated integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i_ j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i_ j \le n$</span>), each giving
        the number of a hill on which the town can be found.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each hill may only have at most one spring or one town.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with one real number, denoting the minimum
    total length of all aqueducts needed to supply each town with
    fresh water from its own unique spring or <tt class="ttfamily">IMPOSSIBLE</tt> if there is no way to achieve this.
    Your answer should be correct up to an absolute or relative
    precision of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
