<p>There is a saying “a good compromise makes no one happy”. As
    distressing as that may be, I guess most people still think it
    is a good idea to seek the best agreement. The problem though,
    is to define the measure in which the word “best” gets a
    meaning. Let us consider <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> people, each with a firm belief on
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> different yes/no
    issues. We may think of the people’s beliefs as binary strings
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> for <span class="tex2jax_process">$0&lt;i\leq n$</span>, i.e. one string per
    person, with entries reflecting a person’s belief in each of
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> issues. An
    <em>agreement</em> is also a binary string <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, indicating the agreed outcome of
    each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> issues.
    Some would argue that the agreement <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> that minimises the maximum of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$H(b_ i-a)$</span> over all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$H(x)$</span> is the Hamming function
    counting the number of non-zero entries of the vector
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, is the best
    compromise. Unfortunately, it is widely believed that finding
    this agreement is computationally infeasible for <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> large. Another reasonable
    suggestion is the agreement <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> that minimises <span class="tex2jax_process">$\left(\sum _{i=1}^ n H(b_ i-a)^
    p\right)^{1/p}$</span> for some positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>. Note in particular that when
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p\rightarrow \infty $</span>,
    this measure coincides with the former. I for one am most
    content with the choice of <span class="tex2jax_process">$p=1$</span> though, don’t you agree?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line of input is a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, telling the number of
    test scenarios to follow. Each test scenario is described by
    two positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n\leq
    100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m\leq
    100$</span>, on a line of their own. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each containing a binary
    string <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> on
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> ‘0’ and ‘1’
    characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test scenario, output the assignment <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> that minimises the measure above
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$p = 1$</span>, on a row of
    its own. If there are several solutions, output anyone.</p>
