<p>Black Friday is the Friday following Thanksgiving Day in the
    United States (the fourth Thursday of November). Since the
    early 2000s, it has been regarded as the beginning of the
    Christmas shopping season in the US, and most major retailers
    open very early and offer promotional sales. (Source:

<p>You work in the IT support division of an electronics store.
    This year, in an attempt to prevent overcrowding, the
    management has decided to limit the number of people entering
    the store. They divide the people at the entrance into groups
    of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and process
    them as follows: all <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    participants roll a die, and report the outcomes <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_ n$</span>. To prevent
    cheating, instead of selecting the one with the highest
    outcome, the rule is to select the participant with the highest
    unique outcome. Everybody not selected has to move to the back
    of the queue. If there is no winner, the experiment is
    repeated.</p>
<p>For example, if there are three players and the outcomes are
    6, 6 and 5, then the third player wins, because the first and
    second player lose even though their outcomes are higher, since
    they both have the same outcome. If instead the third player
    also rolls 6, then nobody wins.</p>
<p>They asked you to write a program for selecting the
    winner.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains one integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100$</span>, the group size.
    The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_ n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a_ i \leq 6$</span> for
    all <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq n$</span>):
    the outcome of each participant’s die roll.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the index of the participant that has the highest
    unique outcome, or “<tt class="ttfamily">none</tt>” (without
    the quotes) if nobody has a unique outcome.</p>
