<div class="problembody">
<p>To keep privacy of messages and prevent the aliens from
    reading them, we may use various encryption algorithms. These
    algorithms encode a message into the so-called
    <em>ciphertext</em> that is difficult (or impossible) to decode
    for anyone else than the intended recipient. <em>Transposition
    ciphers</em> are a type of encryption that do not change the
    letters of the message but only change their order (“shuffle”
    the letters). Of course, the shuffling must be reversible to
    allow later decryption.</p>
<p>In this problem, we will consider a simple transposition
    cipher which shuffles the letters in such a way that the
    <em>decryption</em> algorithm always takes every <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-th letter. More specifically: when
    decrypting, the first letter of the ciphertext is taken first,
    then the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n - 1$</span>
    letters are (repeatedly) skipped and the next letter taken, and
    so on until we reach the end of the ciphertext. After that, we
    repeat the procedure starting with the second letter of the
    ciphertext, and so on until all letters are used.</p>
<p>Your task is to implement the encryption algorithm for this
    cipher. For a given message, produce the encrypted text
    (ciphertext). To make the cipher a little bit stronger, you
    should convert all letters to uppercase and leave out all
    spaces between words.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$150$</span> messages. Each message is
    described by two lines. The first line contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1\ 000$</span>). The second
    line contains the message. The message will be at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\ 000$</span> characters long,
    it will only contain letters and spaces, and there will be at
    least one letter in each message.</p>
<p>The last message is followed by a line containing zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each message, output the ciphertext that, after using
    the described decryption algorithm, will result in the original
    message (with all spaces removed and all letters in
    uppercase).</p>
