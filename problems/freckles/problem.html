<p>In an episode of the Dick Van Dyke show, little Richie
    connects the freckles on his Dad’s back to form a picture of
    the Liberty Bell. Alas, one of the freckles turns out to be a
    scar, so his Ripley’s engagement falls through.</p>
<p>Consider Dick’s back to be a plane with freckles at various
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span> locations. Your
    job is to tell Richie how to connect the dots so as to minimize
    the amount of ink used. Richie connects the dots by drawing
    straight lines between pairs, possibly lifting the pen between
    lines. When Richie is done there must be a sequence of
    connected lines from any freckle to any other freckle.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by
    itself indicating the number of the cases (at most 20)
    following, each of them as described below. This line is
    followed by a blank line, and there is also a blank line
    between two consecutive inputs.</p>
<p>The first line of test case contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; n \le 1000$</span>, the number of
    freckles on Dick’s back. For each freckle, a line follows; each
    following line contains two real numbers indicating the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> coordinates of the
    freckle. The coordinates will be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> in absolute value.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, your program should print a single real
    number to two decimal places: the minimum total length of ink
    lines that can connect all the freckles. Put a blank line
    between outputs for consecutive test cases.</p>
