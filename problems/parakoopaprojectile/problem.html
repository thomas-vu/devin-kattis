<div class="problembody">
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    Parakoopas scattered across the first quadrant of the Cartesian
    plane (positive <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates), and
    Mario stands at the origin, located at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span>, waiting to put a well-known
    proverb to the test. He wants to hit two parakoopas (he’s fine
    hitting more too) with one snowball throw, where a throw is a
    parabola from his starting point at the origin. The throw can
    be modeled by the equation of a parabola <span class="tex2jax_process">$y = a(x-h)^2+k$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$a &lt; 0$</span> (since gravity pulls all
    projectile downwards). The only constraints on <span class="tex2jax_process">$a, h, k$</span> are that <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> must be negative and the parabola
    must pass through the origin. Mario wants to show off to his
    brother Luigi while exerting the least amount of effort as
    possible, so he decides to throw the snowball the shortest
    distance possible while still hitting at least two parakoopas.
    Determine the shortest distance in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-direction that he can throw the
    snowball, given that the snowball stops moving when it hits the
    ground at the x-axis.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 100\, 000$</span>,
    which denotes the number of parakoopas.<br/>
    The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    contain a pair of space separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x,y$</span> denoting the coordinates of a
    parakoopa. The coordinates satisfy <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; x,y \leq 10^{18}$</span>. The test
    data for this problem is constructed in such a way that there
    exists a snowball throw that satisfies the constraints.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single real number denoting the minimum distance
    that Mario can throw the snowball, while still hitting at least
    two parakoopas. Your answer will be considered correct if it
    has a relative or absolute error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>. It is guaranteed that the
    answer will be less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{18}$</span>.</p>
