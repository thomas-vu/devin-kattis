<p><i class="itshape">Mr. G</i> is one of the most excellent
    students in <i class="itshape">North River High School for
    Gifted Students</i>. Despite having impressive performance in a
    programming competition and making it to the next round, he was
    not totally happy since his best friend did not get such a
    great achievement. In order to appease the poor girl, <i class="itshape">Mr. G</i> has to deal with a very hard challenge: Buy
    her some ginger candies!</p>
<p>The road system in <i class="itshape">North River
    province</i> consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> junctions and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> bidirectional roads. Junctions are
    numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, and roads are
    numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, inclusive. On the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> road, which
    connects two junctions <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span>,
    there is a shop in which <i class="itshape">Mr. G</i> can buy
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span> ginger candies. No
    two roads have the same number of candies. <i class="itshape">Mr. G</i> wants to meet his friend at some junction,
    travel through several roads <b class="bfseries">without
    visiting the same road twice</b>, buy <b class="bfseries">all</b> candies on those roads, and finish at the
    same junction where he starts.</p>
<p>Using his humble knowledge in Physics, <i class="itshape">Mr. G</i> calculates the amount of energy he needs to
    spend as follow: Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>
    be the <b class="bfseries">maximum</b> number of candies he
    buys in one road, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    be the number of roads he passes through. The amount of energy
    he needs to spend is <span class="tex2jax_process">$L^2+\alpha
    K$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$\alpha $</span>
    is some constant he has already known.</p>
<p>Help him to satisfy his friend with the minimum amount of
    energy.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\alpha $</span>, the number of
        junctions, the number of roads and the predefined constant
        <i class="itshape">Mr. G</i> uses to calculate the amount
        of energy, respectively (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
        \leq N \leq 10^5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
        \leq M \leq 2 \times 10^5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq \alpha \leq 20$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
        lines, each contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq u \leq N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq v \leq N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6 \leq c \leq 10^9$</span>), meaning
        that there is a road connecting two junctions <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>, which sells <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> ginger candies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is guaranteed that all <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> in the above <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines are distinct.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Write one integer denoting the minimum amount of energy
    <i class="itshape">Mr. G</i> has to spend. If there is no route
    satisfying the condition, output <i class="itshape">Poor
    girl</i> instead.</p>
