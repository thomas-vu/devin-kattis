<div class="problembody">
<p>The construction worker previously known as Lars has many
    bricks of height <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    different lengths, and he is now trying to build a wall of
    width <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and height
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>. Since the
    construction worker previously known as Lars knows that the
    subset sum problem is <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathsf{NP}$</span>-hard, he does not try to
    optimize the placement but he just lays the bricks in the order
    they are in his pile and hopes for the best. First he places
    the bricks in the first layer, left to right; after the first
    layer is complete he moves to the second layer and completes
    it, and so on. He only lays bricks horizontally, without
    rotating them. If at some point he cannot place a brick and has
    to leave a layer incomplete, then he gets annoyed and leaves.
    It does not matter if he has bricks left over after he
    finishes.</p>
<p>Yesterday the construction worker previously known as Lars
    got really annoyed when he realized that he could not complete
    the wall only at the last layer, so he tore it down and asked
    you for help. Can you tell whether the construction worker
    previously known as Lars will complete the wall with the new
    pile of bricks he has today?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq h \leq 100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq
    w \leq 100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n
    \leq 10\, 000$</span>), the height of the wall, the width of
    the wall, and the number of bricks respectively. The second
    line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x_ i \leq 10$</span>), the length of
    each brick.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt> if the construction
    worker previously known as Lars will complete the wall, and
    <tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt> otherwise.</p>
