<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several test cases. Each test case
    starts with a line with four non-negative integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1000$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le m \le 5000$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le q \le 100$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le s &lt; n$</span>,
    separated by single spaces, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the numbers of nodes in the
    graph, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> the number of
    edges, <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> the number of
    queries and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> the index
    of the starting node. Nodes are numbered from 0 to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each line consisting of
    three (space-separated) integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> indicating that there is an edge
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> in the graph with weight
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-2000 \le w \le 2000$</span>.
    Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines of
    queries, each consisting of a single non-negative integer,
    asking for the minimum distance from node <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> to the node number given on the
    query line.</p>
<p>Input will be terminated by a line containing four zeros,
    this line should <em>not</em> be processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query, output a single line containing the minimum
    distance from node <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> to
    the node specified in the query, the word “<tt class="ttfamily">Impossible</tt>” if there is no path from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> to that node, or
    “<tt class="ttfamily">-Infinity</tt>” if there are arbitrarily
    short paths from <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> to
    that node. For clarity, the sample output has a blank line
    between the output for different cases.</p>
