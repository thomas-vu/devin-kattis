<p>Simone is learning to trade crypto currencies. Right now,
    she is looking into a new currency called
    <em>CryptoKattis</em>. A CryptoKattis can be used to improve
    your Kattis ranklist score without having to solve
    problems.</p>
<p>Simone, unlike most competitive programmers, is very
    perceptive of competition trends. She has lately noticed many
    coders talking about a new online judge called <em>Doggo</em>,
    and suspect that using the Kattis judge will soon fall out of
    fashion. This, of course, will cause the CryptoKattis to
    rapidly fall in value once demand fades.</p>
<p>To take advantage of this, Simone has performed very careful
    market research. This has allowed her to estimate the price of
    a CryptoKattis in dollars during the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> days. She intends to use this data
    to perform a <em>short sell</em>. This means she will at some
    day borrow <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>
    CryptoKattis from a bank, immediately selling the currency. At
    some other day, she must purchase the same amount of
    CryptoKattis to repay her loan. For every day between (and
    including) these two days, she must pay <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> dollars in interest. What is the
    maximum profit Simone can make by carefully choosing when to
    borrow and repay the <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>
    CryptoKattis?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 100\, 000$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le K \le 100$</span>.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the number of days
    you know the CryptoKattis price of, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> is the cost in dollars of
    borrowing CryptoKattis per day.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers separated by spaces.
    These are the CryptoKattis prices during the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> days. Each CryptoKattis price is
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> dollars.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single decimal number; the maximum profit you can
    make performing a short sell. If you cannot make a profit no
    matter what short sell you make, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
