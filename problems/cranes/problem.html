<p>A crane is a wonderful tool for putting up a building. It
    makes the job go very quickly. When the building must go up
    even faster, more than one crane can be used. However, when
    there are too many cranes working on the same building, it can
    get dangerous. As the cranes spins around, it can bump into
    another crane if the operator is not careful. Such an accident
    could cause the cranes to fall over, possibly causing major
    damage. Therefore, safety regulations require cranes to be
    spaced far enough apart so that it is impossible for any part
    of a crane to touch any part of any other crane. Unfortunately,
    these regulations limit the number of cranes that can be used
    on the construction site, slowing down the pace of
    construction. Your task is to place the cranes on the
    construction site while respecting the safety regulations.</p>
<p>The construction site is laid out as a square grid. Several
    places on the grid have been marked as possible crane
    locations. The arm of each crane has a certain length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, and can rotate around
    the location of the crane. The crane covers the entire area
    that is no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
    units away from the location of the crane. You are to place the
    cranes to maximize the total area covered by all the
    cranes.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer specifying the
    number of test cases and there will be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> test cases. Each test case begins
    with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, the number of possible locations
    where a crane could be placed. There will be no more than 15
    such locations. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> lines contains three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, all between <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\, 000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span> inclusive and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> will be positive. The first two
    integers are the grid coordinates of the location, and the
    third integer is the length of the arm of the crane that can be
    placed at that location.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, find the maximum area <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> that can be covered by cranes, and
    output a line containing a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$A = B \times \pi $</span>.</p>
