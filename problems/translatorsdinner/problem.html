<p>It is time again for the annual International Convention for
    Phonetic Communication. Because there are attendees from all
    over the world, and they do not all speak the same languages,
    the organizers have hired translators to help out.</p>
<p>To thank the translators at the end of the conference for
    their hard work, the organizers want to arrange a dinner at a
    nice local restaurant. However, the restaurant only has small,
    two person tables, hence the translators will have to be
    divided into pairs. As the organizers would like the
    translators to have a nice evening, they prefer that two
    translators sitting at the same table are both able to speak
    the same language. Write a program to help the organizers
    determine a way to match up the translators in pairs, so that
    each of the translators speaks a language that the other also
    speaks.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, the number of languages spoken at
    the convention, and the number of hired translators
    respectively (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq
    100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq
    200$</span>).</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines
    each describe a translator. Each of these lines contains two
    integers specifying the two languages that the translator
    speaks. Languages are identified by integers in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0,N-1]$</span>.</p>
<p>Translators are identified by integers in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0,M-1]$</span>. Translators are
    listed in order of increasing identifier (i.e. the first listed
    translator has identifier <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>).</p>
<p>There are no two translators who both speak the same two
    languages. Translators have been chosen such that any two
    languages spoken at the conference can be translated into one
    another, although it may take several translators.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is possible to match up all translators such that each
    pair speaks a common language, output a possible matching:
    print <span class="tex2jax_process">$M/2$</span> lines, each
    line containing the two identifiers of a pair of matched
    translators. The pairs, as well as the translators within a
    pair, may be listed in any order.</p>
<p>There may be multiple possible matchings. In that case,
    print any one of them.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to match up all translators, output a
    single line containing the word “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”.</p>
