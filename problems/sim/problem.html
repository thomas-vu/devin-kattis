<p>This problem is an extension of another Kattis problem -
    backspace. In that problem, every time we see a character
    ‘<tt>&lt;</tt>’, it actually means that the ‘Backspace’ key is
    pressed and we undo the last character that was just
    typed.<br/></p>
<p>The extension is as follows: Now, pressing a ‘<tt>&lt;</tt>’
    (the ‘Backspace’ key) when the (typing) cursor is at the front
    of the line <b class="bfseries">does nothing</b>. Now if we see
    a character ‘<tt>[</tt>’, it actually means that the ‘Home’ key
    is pressed and we move the (typing) cursor to the front of the
    line. Similarly, if we see a character ‘<tt>]</tt>’, it
    actually means that the ‘End’ key is pressed and we move the
    (typing) cursor the back of the line. For all other valid
    character in the input, it actually means that the
    corresponding key is pressed, we insert that character at the
    (typing) cursor position, and advance one position to the right
    the cursor accordingly.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line containing just one integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \: (1 \le T \le 10)$</span>,
    denoting the number of test cases.<br/></p>
<p>Each test case is a line containing the string that was
    written in the Text Editor Sim (Steven IMproved). The length of
    the string is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{6}$</span>, and it will only contain
    lowercase letters from the English alphabet [‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>’<span class="tex2jax_process">$\;
    \ldots \; $</span>‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span>’],
    digits [‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>’<span class="tex2jax_process">$\; \ldots \; $</span>‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>’], spaces, as well as some of the
    three special characters: ‘<tt>&lt;</tt>’, ‘<tt>[</tt>’, or
    ‘<tt>]</tt>’.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing the final
    string that is displayed on screen.</p>
