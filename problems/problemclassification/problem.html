<div class="problembody">
<p>When reading programming problems, one can often get some
    hints regarding the topic of the problem by skimming the
    problem statement for certain words. If, for example, the word
    “vertex” or “edge” appears, the problem is almost certainly a
    graph problem, while the words “words” or “letters” suggest
    that the problem is about strings.</p>
<p>Your task is to implement a simple program that attempts to
    classify a problem according to one of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> categories. Each category has an
    associated set of words, which, if they appear as words in a
    statement, suggest the problem belongs to this category. When
    classifying a statement, the program should suggest those
    categories which have the highest number of occurences of their
    associated words. Note that words that are part of other words
    do not count. For example, the word <tt class="ttfamily">statement</tt> should not count as an occurance for
    the word <tt class="ttfamily">ate</tt>.</p>
<p>In the above example, we suggested that the category
    <tt class="ttfamily">graph</tt> may have the associated words
    <tt class="ttfamily">vertex</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">edge</tt> and the category <tt class="ttfamily">string</tt> could have the associated words
    <tt class="ttfamily">words</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">letters</tt>. Then, if there were <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> occurances each of the words
    <tt class="ttfamily">vertex</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">edge</tt>, the number of matches for the category
    <tt class="ttfamily">graph</tt> would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>. If the statement contained
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span> occurances of
    <tt class="ttfamily">words</tt> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> of <tt class="ttfamily">letters</tt>, the number of matches for the category
    <tt class="ttfamily">string</tt> would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$18$</span>. Since there are more matches for
    the second category, the program should suggest it.</p>
<p>If there are multiple categories with the same number of
    matches, your program should suggest all of them.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the number of categories
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 10$</span>.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each
    contain a description of a category. The description starts
    with the name of the category – a single word. Then, an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le W \le 10$</span> follows –
    the number of words associated with this category. This is
    followed by those <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>
    words, separated by spaces. No two words <em>within a
    category</em> are the same, and no two categories have the same
    name.</p>
<p>This is followed by a number of lines describing the
    statement of the problem. Each line contains a list of
    space-separated words.</p>
<p>Every word in the input will consist solely of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> lower-case letters
    <tt class="ttfamily">a-z</tt>. The statement consists of
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span> words.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each suggested category, output the name of the category
    on a single line, in lexicographical order.</p>

consider the hamiltonian graph where each vertex corresponds
to an linear equation we can solve these using the euclid
algorithm now you will receive a query corresponding to a
range of vertices your task is to compute the sum of the
minimum solution of those vertices

problem classification
when reading programming problems one can often get some

word vertex or edge appears the problem is almost
certainly a graph problem while the words words or
letters suggest that the problem is about strings your
task is to implement a simple program that attempts to
classify a problem according to one of n categories each
category has an associated set of words which if they
appear as words in a statement suggest the problem
belongs to this category when classifying a statement
the program should suggest those categories which have
the highest number of occurences of their associated
words in the above example we suggested that the
category graph may have the associated words vertex
and edge and the category string could have the
associated words words and letters then if there were
occurances each of the words vertex and edge the number
of matches for the category graph would be if the
statement contained occurances of words and of letters
the number of matches for the category string would be 
since there are more matches for the second category
the program should suggest it if there are multiple
categories with the same number of matches your
program should suggest all of them
input
the first line of input contains the number of categories
n the next n lines each contain a description of a
category the description starts with the name of the
category a single word then an integer w follows 
the number of words associated with this category this
is followed by those w words separated by spaces this
is followed by a number of lines describing the
statement of the problem each line contains a list of
spaceseparated words every word in the input will
consist solely of lowercase letters a z output for each
suggested category output the name of the category on a
single line in lexicographical order
