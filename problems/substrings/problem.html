<p>String analysis often arises in applications from biology
    and chemistry, such as the study of DNA and protein molecules.
    One interesting problem is to find how many substrings are
    repeated (at least twice) in a long string.</p>
<p>In this problem, you will write a program to find the total
    number of repeated substrings in a string of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> alphabetic
    characters. Any unique substring that occurs more than once is
    counted. As an example, if the string is “aabaab”, there are 5
    repeated substrings: “a”, “aa”, “aab”, “ab”, “b”. If the string
    is “aaaaa”, the repeated substrings are “a”, “aa”, “aaa”,
    “aaaa”. Note that repeated occurrences of a substring may
    overlap (e.g. “aaaa” in the second case).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of at most 10 cases. The first line
    contains a positive integer, specifying the number of cases to
    follow. Each of the following line contains a nonempty string
    of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>
    alphabetic characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line of input, output one line containing the
    number of unique substrings that are repeated. You may assume
    that the correct answer fits in a signed 32-bit integer.</p>
