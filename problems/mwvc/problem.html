<div class="problembody">
<p>The Minimum Weighted Vertex Cover (<span class="scshape">MWVC</span>) problem is to find the vertex cover with
    the minimum sum of weights of a particular given graph.</p>
<p>Your program should take as input a single MWVC instance. It
    will be run several times, once for every test case. The time
    limit is per test case.</p>
<p>For simplicity, the graph will contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> vertices and <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> undirected edges. The vertices
    will be labelled from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> and the graph
    will not contain multi-edges or self-loop.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of standard input contains two integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 4000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq E \leq 600000$</span>
    representing the number of vertices and edges respectively. The
    second line of standard input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> integer represents the vertex
    weight for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span>
    vertex. All vertex weights are positive and will be not more
    than 1 000 000. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> lines each contain a pair of
    vertex numbers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>. This denotes that
    there is an undirected edge connecting vertices <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>. It is guaranteed that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x \neq y$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>On the first line, output the total sum of vertex weights in
    the vertex cover. On the second line, output up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> vertices on a single line. These
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> vertices should not
    contain duplicate values and should form a vertex cover. More
    specifically, all vertex numbers must be within <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> and there should not be two of
    the same vertex number in the line.</p>
<h2>Score</h2>
<p>Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$Opt$</span> be the length
    of an optimal minimum weighted vertex cover, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Val$</span> be the sum of vertex weights of
    the vertex cover found by your solution, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Naive$</span> be the sum of vertex weights
    found by the algorithm below.</p>
<p>Define <span class="tex2jax_process">$x=(Val - Opt)/(Naive -
    Opt)$</span>. (In the special case that <span class="tex2jax_process">$Naive=Opt$</span>, define <span class="tex2jax_process">$x=0$</span> if <span class="tex2jax_process">$Val=Opt$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x=\inf $</span> if <span class="tex2jax_process">$Val&gt;Opt$</span>.)</p>
<p>The score on a test case is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.02^{x}$</span>. Thus, if your vertex cover
    is optimal, you will get 1 point on this test case. If your
    score is halfway between <span class="tex2jax_process">$Naive$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Opt$</span>, you get roughly <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.14$</span> points. The total score of your
    submission is the sum of your score over all test cases. There
    will be a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span>
    test cases. Thus, an implementation of the algorithm below
    should give a score of at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.8$</span> (it will get 0.02 points on most
    test cases, and 1.0 points on some easy cases where it manages
    to find an optimal solution).</p>
<p>The algorithm giving the value <span class="tex2jax_process">$Naive$</span> is the as follows:</p>
<pre>
SimpleWVC(vertices, edges)
  for every edge (u, v) in edges
    if weight[u] &lt; weight[v]
      used[u] = True
    else if weight[u] &gt; weight[v]
      used[v] = True
    else if u &lt; v
      used[u] = True
    else
      used[v] = True
  
  initialize vertex_cover to an empty list
  for i = 0 to n-1
    if used[i]
      append i to vertex_cover
  return vertex_cover
