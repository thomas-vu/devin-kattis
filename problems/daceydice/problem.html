<p>Dacey the Dice is lost in the twisted forest and needs help
    to find a way back home. Dacey the Dice moves by rolling over
    from one side to the next along dark and petrifying pathways.
    Dacey’s goal is to make a safe return to Dacey’s Home Sweet
    Home, which is a safeguarded by a magnetic door.</p>
<p>The twisted forest is laid out as an <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \times N$</span> grid, where each of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N^2$</span> locations
    corresponds to an intersection in the forest. Dacey starts his
    frightful journey at one of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N^2$</span> locations with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> dot at the top and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> dots facing right. This implies
    there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> dots at the
    bottom, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> dots facing
    left, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> dots facing
    upwards, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> dots
    facing downwards. (Note that the two numbers of opposite faces
    of a die always add up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>. Also, the only side that you
    cannot see is the bottom.) Every dot on Dacey the Dice contains
    a powerful magnet.</p>
<p>Dacey’s Home Sweet Home is underground and is located at one
    of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N^2$</span>
    intersections. Dacey’s Home Sweet Home is secured by a door
    containing four magnets. The magnetic door will only open when
    Dacey is standing on top of the door with the side with five
    dots facing downwards. If Dacey stands on the door with any
    other side facing downwards, the door won’t open, but Dacey can
    still move past.</p>
<p>Some of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N^2$</span>
    locations are occupied by a wicked gigantic magnet which, if
    ever stepped on by Dacey, immediately will turn Dacey into a
    petrified immovable monument. Dacey’s initial location and
    Dacey’s Home Sweet Home are never occupied by a wicked gigantic
    magnet.</p>
<p>Dacey the Dice can only move by rolling over, which changes
    both Dacey’s position and orientation. For example, if Dacey
    has <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> dot at the top and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> dots facing left, and
    rolls right to the adjacent location, Dacey will afterwards
    have <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> dot facing right
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> dots at the top.
    It takes exactly one roll to move between two adjacent
    locations. Dacey cannot roll diagonally and cannot roll outside
    the twisted forest.</p>
<p>Your task is to determine whether Dacey can reach the
    comfort of the inside of Dacey’s Home Sweet Home or not.</p>
<h2>Input Format</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 100$</span> giving the number of test
    cases. Each case starts with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 20$</span>), the length of the
    sides of the twisted forest. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> characters each, describing the
    twisted forest. Each location in the forest is described by one
    of the following characters:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">.</tt> – Normal location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">*</tt> – Wicked gigantic magnet</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">S</tt> – Dacey’s initial
        location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">H</tt> – Dacey’s Home Sweet
        Home</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be exactly one cell for Dacey’s initial location,
    and exactly one cell for Dacey’s Home Sweet Home.</p>
<h2>Output Format</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line with “<tt class="ttfamily">Yes</tt>” if Dacey can successfully can get inside
    Dacey’s Home Sweet Home, or “<tt class="ttfamily">No</tt>”
    otherwise.</p>
