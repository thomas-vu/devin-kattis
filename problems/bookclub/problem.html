<em>The famous staircase in Lello bookstore, downtown
        Porto.</em>
</div>
</div>
<p>Porto’s book club is buzzing with excitement for the annual
    book exchange event! Every year, members bring their favorite
    book and try to find another book they like that is owned by
    someone willing to trade with them.</p>
<p>I have been to this book exchange before, and I definitely
    do not want to miss it this year, but I feel that the trading
    should be improved. In the past, pairs of members interested in
    each other’s books would simply trade: imagine that person A
    brought a book that person B liked and vice-versa, then A and B
    would exchange their books.</p>
<p>I then realized that many members were left with the same
    book they walked-in with... If instead of looking for pairs I
    looked for triplets, I could find more valid exchanges! Imagine
    that member A only likes member B’s book, while B only likes
    C’s book and C likes A’s book. These 3 people could trade their
    books in a cycle and everyone would be happy!</p>
<p>But why stop at triplets? Cycles could be bigger and bigger!
    Could you help me find if it is possible for everyone to go out
    with a new book? Be careful, because members will not give
    their book without receiving one they like in return.</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>Given the members of the book club and the books they like,
    can we find cycles so that everyone receives a new book?</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line has two integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of people, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, the total number of
    “declarations of interest”. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines has two integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, indicating that member
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> likes the book that
    member <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> brought
    (<span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq A,B &lt; N$</span></span>). Numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> will never be the same (a member
    never likes the book he brought).</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>You should output <tt class="tt">YES</tt> if we can find a
    new book for every club member and <tt class="tt">NO</tt> if
    that is not possible.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 10\,
    000$</span><br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq 20\, 000$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M \leq N^2-N$</span>.</p>
