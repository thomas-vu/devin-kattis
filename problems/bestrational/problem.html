<p>Many microcontrollers have no floating point unit but do
    have a (reasonably) fast integer divide unit. In these cases it
    may pay to use rational values to approximate floating point
    constants. For instance,</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    355/113 = 3.1415929203539823008849557522124 \ldots \]</span>
<p>is a quite good approximation to</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \pi = 3.14159265358979323846 \ldots
    \]</span>
<p>A <em>best rational approximation</em> <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span> to a real number <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> with denominator at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> is a rational number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span> (in lowest terms)
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$q \le M$</span> such that,
    for any integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$b \le M$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> relatively prime, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span> is at least as close to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> as <span class="tex2jax_process">$a/b$</span>:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ |x - p/q| \le |x - a/b| \]</span>
<p>Write a program to compute the best rational approximation
    to a real number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>,
    with denominator at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 1\, 000$</span>), which is the
    number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be
    processed identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by the maximum
    denominator value, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$15 \le M \le 1\, 000\,
    000$</span>), followed by a real number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le x &lt; 1$</span>), given with at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$18$</span> digits after the period.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is a single line of output. The
    single output line consists of the data set number,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single
    space followed by the numerator, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, of the best rational
    approximation to <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>,
    followed by a forward slash (/) followed by the denominator,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>, of the best rational
    approximation to <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>.</p>
