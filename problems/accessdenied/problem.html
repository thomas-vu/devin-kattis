</div>Computer passwords have been around for a long time. In
    fact, 60 years ago <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compatible_Time-Sharing_System">CTSS</a>
    was one of the first computers with a password. The
    implementation of this was very simple. In CTSS the password
    was stored in plain text in a file on disk. When logging in,
    the user would enter a password. The computer would then
    compare the password to the password on disk. If the comparison
    failed, it would deny access, if it succeeded, access would be
    allowed. Researchers at MIT were quick to discover several
    security flaws in this password system. We will explore one of
    them, the timing attack.
    <p>In a timing attack, we exploit that we can deduce a
    computation path from the time it takes to do the computation.
    In CTSS the password check was done using a simple string
    matching algorithm, similar to this:</p>
<pre>
bool CheckPassword(string pwd1, string pwd2) {
    if (pwd1.Length != pwd2.Length) {
        return false;
    }
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; pwd1.Length; i++) {
        if (pwd1[i] != pwd2[i]) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
</pre>
<p>For the purpose of this problem, we will use a (very)
    simplified timing model and the above algorithm. The timing
    model looks as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>A branching statement (if or for) takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> ms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An assignment, or update of a memory address takes
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> ms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A comparison between two memory addresses takes
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> ms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A return statement takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> ms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The password consists of between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> English letters, upper or lower
    case, and digits.</p>
<h2>Interaction</h2>
<p>This is an interactive problem. Your submission will be run
    against an <em>interactor</em>, which reads the standard output
    of your submission and writes to the standard input of your
    submission. This interaction needs to follow a specific
    protocol:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Your program first sends a password string, consisting
        of between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> English letters,
        upper or lower case, and digits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depending on if the password is correct, the interactor
        then responds with either:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If the password is correct; “<tt class="ttfamily">ACCESS GRANTED</tt>”. Your program should
            then exit cleanly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the password is incorrect; “<tt class="ttfamily">ACCESS DENIED (<span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> ms)</tt>”, where
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> is the time it
            took to verify the password in ms. Your program can
            then make another guess.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure you flush the buffer after each write. You can
    guess at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 500$</span>
    times. A testing tool is provided to help you develop your
    solution.</p>
