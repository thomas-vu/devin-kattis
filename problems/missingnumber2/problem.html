<div class="problembody">
<p>Kirby has written down all the integers from <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> in order. He wrote them down as
    one big string, with no spaces between them and no leading
    zeroes, and he didnâ€™t tell you the values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>!</p>
<p>Because Kirby was hungry, he ate one of the numbers. Can you
    figure out what number he ate?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le t \le 10^5$</span>), which is the number of test cases that
    follow.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>
    lines contains a string of digits of length at least one and at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$488888$</span>. This string
    is what Kirby wrote. Note that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le a &lt; b \le 99999$</span>. It is guaranteed that this
    string can be obtained by the process given above.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that the sum of the lengths of all the
    strings does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$2t$</span> lines, two
    for each test case.</p>
<p>On the first line, output a single integer, which is the
    number of numbers that Kirby could have possibly eaten.</p>
<p>On the second line, output the numbers that Kirby could have
    eaten, in ascending order, separated by at least one space.</p>
