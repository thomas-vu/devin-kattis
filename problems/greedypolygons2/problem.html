<p>MAPS 2020 included a problem named “Greedy Polygons”
    that described a dystopian world in which the greed that often
    characterizes human nature had spread to regular polygons,
    causing these normally well-behaved shapes to exhibit
    expansionistic tendencies. Now, as feared, this avarice has
    advanced further, infecting all convex polygons.</p>
<p>In the past, the area of a convex polygon was fixed, but
    now, whenever it gets the chance, a convex polygon will carry
    out an expansion operation informally known as a “land grab.” A
    land grab with expansion distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$d &gt; 0$</span> works as follows: every
    point outside the polygon that is at most
    distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> from
    some point in the polygon is absorbed and becomes part of the
    enlarged polygon. (For our purposes, a polygon includes its
    interior, i.e., it is a solid shape.) Over time, a convex
    polygon might carry out many land grabs. (Technically, a convex
    polygon ceases to be a convex polygon (or any kind of polygon
    at all) after the first land grab, but, alas, such is the
    distorting effect of greed.)</p>
<p>Given an initial convex polygon and an expansion
    distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, what is
    the area of the resulting region after a specified number of
    land grabs?</p>
<p>Figure <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> depicts
    Sample Input <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>,
    which describes a <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>-sided convex polygon that carries
    out <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> land
    grabs.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three space-separated
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n, d, g$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of
    convex polygon vertices <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3 \leq
    n \leq 60)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is
    the expansion distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq d
    \leq 10)$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>
    is the number of land grabs <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0
    \leq g \leq 20)$</span>. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each of which contains
    two space-separated integers, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates, respectively, of one
    of the polygon vertices. Each coordinate is in the interval
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-1\, 000, 1\, 000]$</span>. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> vertices are distinct,
    and are given in no particular order. It is guaranteed that
    no <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> vertices are
    collinear.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the area of the region occupied by the convex polygon
    after <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> land grabs. Your
    answer will be considered correct if it is within <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span> of the official answer.</p>
