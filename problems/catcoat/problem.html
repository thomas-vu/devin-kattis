</div>The color of a cat is primarily decided by three genes,
    coding for Black (Eumelanin), Red (Phaeomelanin) and Dilution
    (Melanophilin). The cat genetics experts among the readers will
    note that we are ignoring a wide range of genes, e.g.,
    Tyrosinase and the white masking gene – we apologize in advance
    for the oversimplifications that are to ensue.

    <p>Black is usually written as <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>, Red
    as <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt>, Dilution as <tt class="ttfamily">D</tt>. In general, a cat has two copies of each
    gene, one from each parent (except for the red gene which is
    sex-bound, we’ll return to that later). Each copy can be either
    <em>dominant</em>, which we’ll denote using an upper case
    letter, or <em>recessive</em>, which we’ll denote using a lower
    case letter. Thus for each gene there are three possibilities:
    either both copies of the gene are dominant, both are
    recessive, or one is dominant and the other is recessive. When
    describing a cat we’ll write this as a pair of letters, with
    the second one possibly being a “<tt class="ttfamily">-</tt>”
    to indicate a wildcard. For example, “<tt class="ttfamily">bb</tt>” indicates that the cat has two recessive
    black genes, and “<tt class="ttfamily">B-</tt>” indicates that
    the cat has a dominant black gene and that we don’t care about
    whether the other one is dominant or recessive.</p>
<p>When a cat has no dominant red (<tt class="ttfamily">O</tt>)
    gene, its coat will be a variation of black, according to the
    following four combinations:</p>
<center>
<table cellspacing="0" class="tabular">
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">B-D-</tt>: Black</p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">B-dd</tt>: Blue</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">bbD-</tt>: Chocolate</p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">bbdd</tt>: Lilac</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>Now, red (<tt class="ttfamily">O</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">o</tt>) is sex bound on the X chromosone. This means
    a male cat, or tom, only has a single red gene, while a female
    has two. Red dominates black, meaning that a cat having an
    <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt> gene will always have red coloring.
    Like black, red is also affected by the dilution gene. For male
    cats, we have the following two possible red colors (here, the
    black genes have no effect on the coat color):</p>
<center>
<table cellspacing="0" class="tabular">
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">D-O</tt>: Red</p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">ddO</tt>: Cream</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>For female cats the situation gets a bit more complicated.
    If the female has two <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt> genes she
    will be be red, with variations depending on the dilution gene
    in exactly the same way as for male red cats:</p>
<center>
<table cellspacing="0" class="tabular">
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">D-OO</tt>: Red</p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">ddOO</tt>: Cream</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>However, a female cat with the <tt class="ttfamily">Oo</tt>
    combination will have a partially black, partially red, coat.
    These cats are known as Torties (Tortoiseshells), and named
    after both their coat colours, starting with the black. The
    four possible Tortie colorings are thus as follows:</p>
<center>
<table cellspacing="0" class="tabular">
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">B-D-Oo</tt>: Black-Red
            Tortie</p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">B-ddOo</tt>: Blue-Cream
            Tortie</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">bbD-Oo</tt>: Chocolate-Red
            Tortie</p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">bbddOo</tt>: Lilac-Cream
            Tortie</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>When a pair of cats have kittens, the offspring will get a
    random set of genes from their parents according to the
    following simple process: for each gene, independently, one of
    the copies is selected uniformly at random from the father’s
    two copies, and the other copy is selected uniformly at random
    from the mother’s two copies. For the red gene, there is a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$50\% $</span> chance that the
    offspring will be female in which case it will get the father’s
    red gene (and one of the mother’s red genes at random), and a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$50\% $</span> chance that the
    offspring will be male in which case it will only get one of
    the mother’s red genes (at random).</p>
<p>Write a program which, given the colors of two cats,
    computes the most likely color for their offspring. For cats
    having a color where some genes do not affect the color, assume
    that the corresponding genes are uniformly random (over the two
    choices dominant/recessive). For example, if a cat is red, you
    should assume that the possibilities “<tt class="ttfamily">DD</tt>” and “<tt class="ttfamily">Dd</tt>” for the
    dilution gene are equally likely, and that the four
    possibilities “<tt class="ttfamily">BB</tt>”, “<tt class="ttfamily">Bb</tt>”, “<tt class="ttfamily">bB</tt>” and
    “<tt class="ttfamily">bb</tt>” are equally likely for the black
    gene (but note that “<tt class="ttfamily">Bb</tt>” and
    “<tt class="ttfamily">bB</tt>” are equivalent).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two lines. The first line gives the
    color of the female cat, and the second line gives the color of
    the male cat. Each color is spelled and capitalized exactly as
    when it is listed above, and the color is valid (i.e., the male
    cat won’t be a Tortie).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a list of the possible color outcomes for the
    offspring of the two cats. Each line should contain a color
    followed by a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; p
    \le 1$</span> indicating the probability of this particular
    outcome.</p>
<p>The list should be sorted first in decreasing order by
    probability, then in alphabetic order by name (see sample input
    3 below). You do not need to worry about the precise formatting
    of the probabilities (e.g., number of decimals), but the
    absolute error of each probability must be smaller than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-9}$</span>.</p>
