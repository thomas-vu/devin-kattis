<div class="problembody">
<p>You are an invoker, a master sorcerer that is able to
    command sources of magic.</p>
<h2>Magical Training</h2>
<p>There are two sources of magic you can control, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathbb {R}$</span>eagus and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathbb {I}$</span>magus. Each source has a
    potency coefficient in front of it. This potency is a real
    number at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span> in
    absolute value.</p>
<p>As an invoker you have the choice of combining two sources
    of magic (denoted <span class="tex2jax_process">$\oplus
    $</span>), or casting one on to another (denoted <span class="tex2jax_process">$\otimes $</span>).</p>
<p>The rules for combining sources is as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Combining a source of Reagus or Imagus with another
        source of equal type creates the same type but you add the
        potencies.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$x\mathbb {R}\oplus
            y\mathbb {R}=(x+y)\mathbb {R}$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$x\mathbb {I}\oplus
            y\mathbb {I}=(x+y)\mathbb {I}$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Combining a source of Reagus and Imagus together creates
        a new complex form of magic.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$x\mathbb {R}\oplus
            y\mathbb {I} \in \mathbb {C}_{\mathbb {M}}$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Casting sources of magic has some different laws:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Casting Reagus on to Reagus creates a source of Reagus
        whose potency is the product of the previous sources.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$x\mathbb {R}\otimes
            y\mathbb {R} = (x\cdot y)\mathbb {R}$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casting Imagus on to another source of Imagus creates
        anti-Reagus (negative potency) with a potency of the
        product of the two sources.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$x\mathbb {I}\otimes
            y\mathbb {I} = -(x\cdot y)\mathbb {R}$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Casting Reagus on Imagus or Imagus on Reagus creates
        Imagus with a potency of the product of the two
        sources.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$x\mathbb {R}\otimes
            y\mathbb {I} = (x\cdot y)\mathbb {I}$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Another thing that you remember well from your studies is
    that for every magical source, there is an anti-source that
    when cast will neutralize the magical energies.</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \forall s\in \mathbb {M}~ \exists
    s^{-1}\in \mathbb {M} : s\otimes s^{-1} = \epsilon \]</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathbb {M}$</span> is
    the set of non-zero magical sources and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\epsilon $</span> is the neutral source, or
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\mathbb {R}$</span>.</p>
<p>Additionally, every magic source <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> has a magic complement
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s^\dagger $</span> such
    that:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \begin{aligned}
    s=x\mathbb {R}&amp; \rightarrow s^\dagger =s\\ s=y\mathbb
    {I}&amp; \rightarrow s^\dagger =-s\\ s=x\mathbb {R}\oplus
    y\mathbb {I}&amp; \rightarrow s+s^\dagger =2x\mathbb {R}
    \end{aligned} \]</span>
<p>Casting a magic source on its complement (or visa versa),
    generates a non-negative number known as the potency norm of
    the source.</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ s\otimes
    s^\dagger = |s|^2 \]</span>
<h3>Problem</h3>
<p>You are currently locked in battle against an equally
    powerful foe. You recognize that you can defeat them by
    neutralizing their source of magic. That is, you cast a spell
    on them that will turn their source into the neutral source
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\epsilon = 1\mathbb
    {R}$</span>.</p>
<p>However, magic is not without its consequences. Any source
    you cast on your opponent will also be cast on you as well,
    changing your current magical source.</p>
<p>When the dust settles and you are declared victorious, what
    is your new magical source?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The inputs are two magical sources separated by new lines.
    Each line contains two space-separated integers. The first
    integer is the potency of Reagus, and the second integer is the
    potency of Imagus.</p>
<p>The first line contains your sources <span class="tex2jax_process">$a,b$</span>, and the second line contains
    your opponents sources <span class="tex2jax_process">$c,d$</span>.</p>
<p>All sources are integers in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^6 \le a,b,c,d \le 10^6$</span>, and
    neither source has both potencies equal to zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output your resulting source after you have annihilated your
    opponent. The output should be two space-separated values
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x,y$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is the potency of Reagus and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> the potency of Imagus
    present in your final source.</p>
<p>Your answers will be accepted if they have an absolute or
    relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span>.</p>
