        A Rocket launch (Public Domain, NASA via Wikimedia

<p>Birk has made a new shiny rocket and just received his
    licence from the Bluesky Global Order (BGO) to launch anytime
    within the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> days.
    He is, however, worried that the rocket will hit space junk on
    its way. In order minimize the risk of a collision, Birk has
    made a model of how many pieces of space junk there will be for
    each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> days.
    He decided that he will launch his rocket on the day with the
    least space junk, and if there are multiple days with the same
    amount of space junk he of course wants to send his rocket up
    as early as possible.</p>
<p>Can you help Birk find out how many days he has to wait
    until he sends up his rocket?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line there is a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 100\, 000$</span>) the number of days for which the
    launch license is valid. On the second line follows
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th integer is the amount of space
    junk on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th day.
    The first day is day <span class="tex2jax_process">$i=0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the number of days Birk needs to
    wait before he launches his rocket.</p>
