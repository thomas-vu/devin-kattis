<div class="problembody">
<p>Jimmy experiences a lot of stress at work these days,
    especially since his accident made working difficult. To relax
    after a hard day, he likes to walk home. To make things even
    nicer, his office is on one side of a forest, and his house is
    on the other. A nice walk through the forest, seeing the birds
    and chipmunks is quite enjoyable.</p>
<p>The forest is beautiful, and Jimmy wants to take a different
    route everyday. He also wants to get home before dark, so he
    always takes a path to make progress towards his house. He
    considers taking a path from <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> to be progress if there exists a
    route from <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> to his home
    that is shorter than any possible route from <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>. Calculate how many different
    routes through the forest Jimmy might take.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains several test cases (at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>) followed by a line containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. Jimmy has numbered
    each intersection or joining of paths starting with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. His office is
    numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and his
    house is numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>. The
    first line of each test case gives the number of intersections
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 &lt; N \le 1000$</span>, and the number of
    paths <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>. The following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines each contain a
    pair of intersections <span class="tex2jax_process">$a,
    b$</span> and an integer distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le d \le 1000000$</span> indicating a
    path of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> between
    intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and a
    different intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. Jimmy may walk a path any
    direction he chooses. There is at most one direct path between
    any pair of intersections.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single integer indicating the
    number of different routes through the forest. You may assume
    that this number does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$2147483647$</span>.</p>
