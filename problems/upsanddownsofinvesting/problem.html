<p>Liam is heavily invested in the stock market, and has
    various theories that he uses to predict when the market will
    rise and when it will fall. Lately, things haven’t been going
    too well – the only thing rising is his frustration and the
    only thing falling is his portfolio. He has decided that he
    needs more data to test his theories with. One characteristic
    of the market he is particularly interested in is the peaks and
    valleys of the price of particular stocks. Liam’s definition of
    a peak is an increasing sequence of at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> consecutive stock prices ending on
    a <em>peak day</em>, and then a decreasing sequence of at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> consecutive stock
    prices starting on the peak day (where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> depends on the particular stock).
    A valley is analogous: a decreasing sequence of at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> consecutive stock
    prices ending on a <em>valley day</em>, and then an increasing
    sequence of at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    consecutive stock prices starting on the valley day (where
    again <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> depends on the
    particular stock and may differ from <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>). For example, consider the two
    weeks of stock prices shown below:</p>

<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth ]{upsanddowns.jpg}" src="/problems/upsanddownsofinvesting/file/statement/en/img-0001.jpg" style="width:90.00%"/>
</center>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=2$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m=3$</span> then there are three
    peaks in this data (with highest points on days <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>) and one valley (with lowest
    point on day <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>). Notice
    that there is no valley around day <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>, since there is not an increasing
    sequence of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>
    starting at day <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>.</p>
<p>Given a set of stock prices and values for <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, Liam would like to know how many
    peaks and valleys there are in the data.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line containing three positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s \leq 1\, 000$</span> is the number
    of stock prices, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n,m
    \leq 100$</span> are the parameters described above. Following
    this line will be one or more lines containing a total of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> stock prices. All
    stock prices are non-negative and no two consecutive stock
    prices will be the same.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the number of peaks in the data and the number of
    valleys in the data.</p>
