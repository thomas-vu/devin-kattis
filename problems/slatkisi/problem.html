<div class="problembody">
<p>Mirko buys a lot of candy in the candy shop. He cannot
    always pay the exact amount so the shopkeeper and he have an
    agreement. He tells the shopkeeper the smallest bill he has,
    and she rounds his amount to the nearest number he can pay. For
    example, if the smallest bill Mirko has is a hundred bill, and
    he wants to buy <span class="tex2jax_process">$150$</span>
    Kunas of candy, the shopkeeper rounds his amount to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> Kunas. If he wants
    to buy <span class="tex2jax_process">$149$</span> Kunas of
    candy, the shopkeeper rounds his amount to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> Kunas.</p>
<p>Lately, Mirko suspects the shoopkeeper is trying to cheat
    him. He asked you to help him. Write a program that will help
    him. His mother only gives Mirko <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 10, 100, 1\, 000, \ldots , 1\, 000\,
    000\, 000$</span> Kuna bills. He never has bills that are not
    powers of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. The bills
    he does have, he has in large amounts.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains two integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le C \le 1\, 000\, 000\, 000$</span>),
    the price of candy Mirko is going to buy, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le K \le 9$</span>), number of zeros on the smallest bill
    Mirko has.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output should contain one
    integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> rounded to
    the nearest amount Mirko can pay.</p>
