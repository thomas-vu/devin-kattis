<p>As humans work toward establishing a permanent presence on
    other planets and their moons, as well as on our own moon,
    various sporting bodies are under pressure to rethink the
    notion of a <em>world record</em>. Traditionally an athlete on
    Earth sets a new world record in a particular sport by
    surpassing the previous world record in an official event. For
    example, in the high jump, a new world record is set by jumping
    higher than the previous world record height. However, clearly
    this becomes less meaningful if an athlete jumps higher simply
    by competing in a high jump event on a planet or moon whose
    gravity is lower than Earth’s. In light of such considerations,
    the newly formed Intergalactic Athletics Federation (IAF) has
    begun debating the criteria for setting an <em>off-world
    record</em> in each sport it oversees. For the high jump, the
    IAF has decided that an athlete sets a new off-world record if
    the height of the athlete’s jump (in an official event) is
    greater than the <em>sum</em> of the current off-world record
    and the previous off-world record.</p>
<p>Given all the high jump heights certified by the IAF during
    a competition year<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000006"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> in the
    chronological order in which they occurred, determine how many
    of these high jump heights set a new off-world record.</p>
<p>Note that the instant a new off-world record is set, it
    becomes the current off-world record, and the off-world record
    that was just superseded becomes the previous off-world
    record.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three space-separated
    integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number
    of high jump heights certified by the IAF during a competition
    year <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq n \leq
    100)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, the
    current off-world record height (i.e., the off-world record
    immediately prior to start of the competition year), and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, the previous
    off-world record height (i.e., the off-world record immediately
    before the current off-world record).<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000007"><sup class="footnotemark">2</sup></a> This is
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines,
    each of which contains a high jump height certified by the IAF
    during the competition year.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000008"><sup class="footnotemark">3</sup></a> These heights
    are in the chronological order in which they occurred, all
    height values lie in the interval <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1, 10^9]$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c &gt; p$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the number of new off-world records
    set during the competition year.</p>
