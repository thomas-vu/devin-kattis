<div class="problembody">
<p>Mirko has been a very good boy, so he got exactly what he
    wanted for his birthday, a “Young physicist” kit! In the kit,
    there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> types of
    resistors, connecting wires and an ohmmeter. If a resistor is
    of type <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, it provides a
    resistance of precisely <span class="tex2jax_process">$R_
    i$</span> ohms.</p>
<p>As we all know, resistors can be connected in two different
    ways, in series and parallel. Also, we know that the complete
    circuit of resistors can be replaced with one resistor of the
    resistance equal to the equivalent resistance of the circuit.
    When the circuit is series, it is written as <tt class="ttfamily">(R1-R2-R3-</tt>…<tt class="ttfamily">-RK)</tt> and
    the following formula holds:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{equation*} R_{\mathrm{eq}} = R_1 + R_2
    + R_3 + \cdots + R_ K \quad . \end{equation*}</span>
<p>When the circuit is parallel, it is written as <tt class="ttfamily">(R1|R2|R3|</tt>…<tt class="ttfamily">|RK)</tt> and
    the following formula holds:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{equation*} R_{\mathrm{eq}} =
    \frac{1}{1/R_1 + 1/R_2 + 1/R_3 + \cdots + 1/R_ K} \quad .
    \end{equation*}</span>
<p>Mirko was excited to bring his new toy to school, where he
    showed it to all his friends. Unfortunately for him, the
    teacher also noticed the toy. She quickly connected a circuit
    and is now asking Mirko to tell her the equivalent resistance
    of the circuit. Help Mirko and answer the teacher’s
    question!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq $</span>N<span class="tex2jax_process">$ \leq 9$</span>)
    from the task. The following line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$R_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; R_ i &lt; 100$</span>) from the task.
    The last line contains the circuit <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, that will not be longer than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> characters.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> will only consist of
    the following characters: ‘<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>’,
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">1</tt>’–‘<tt class="ttfamily">9</tt>’,
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">(</tt>’, ‘<tt class="ttfamily">)</tt>’,
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">-</tt>’ and ‘<tt class="ttfamily">|</tt>’. The number of pairs of brackets will be
    minimal, and the brackets will be paired properly. Inside of a
    pair of brackets, there will not be the character ‘<tt class="ttfamily">-</tt>’ and the character ‘<tt class="ttfamily">|</tt>’ at the same time. The circuit will only
    consist of the resistors from the kit and it is possible that
    not all types of resistors are used, or that one type of
    resistor is used several times.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the number
    from the task. An absolute error up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span> will be accepted.</p>
