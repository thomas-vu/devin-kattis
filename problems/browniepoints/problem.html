<p>Stan and Ollie play the game of Odd Brownie Points. Some
    brownie points are located in the plane, at integer
    coordinates. Stan plays first and places a vertical line in the
    plane. The line must go through a brownie point and may cross
    many (with the same <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-coordinate). Then Ollie places a
    horizontal line that must cross a brownie point already crossed
    by the vertical line.</p>
<p>Those lines divide the plane into four quadrants. The
    quadrant containing points with arbitrarily large positive
    coordinates is the top-right quadrant.</p>
<p>The players score according to the number of brownie points
    in the quadrants. If a brownie point is crossed by a line, it
    does not count. Stan gets a point for each (uncrossed) brownie
    point in the top-right and bottom-left quadrants. Ollie gets a
    point for each (uncrossed) brownie point in the top-left and
    bottom-right quadrants.</p>
<p>Your task is to compute the scores of Stan and Ollie given
    the point through which they draw their lines.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains a number of test cases, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span>. The data of each test case
    appear on a sequence of input lines. The first line of each
    test case contains a positive odd integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 20\, 000$</span> which is the
    number of brownie points. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contains two integers, the
    horizontal (<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>) and
    vertical (<span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>) coordinates
    of a brownie point. All coordinates are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span> in absolute value. No two
    brownie points occupy the same place. The input ends with a
    line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    (instead of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> of a
    test).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case of input, print a line with two numbers
    separated by a single space. The first number is Stanâ€™s score,
    the second is the score of Ollie when their lines cross the
    point whose coordinates are given at the center of the input
    sequence of points for this case.</p>
