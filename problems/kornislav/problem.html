<p>Kornislav the turtle never has anything interesting to do.
    Since he’s going to live for three hundred years, he keeps
    trying to find way to kill time. This weekend he started
    playing "enclose the largest rectangle".</p>
<p>To start with, Kornislav needs four positive integers. He
    tries to enclose a rectangle by moving in one direction, then
    turning 90 degrees, then walking in the new direction etc.
    Kornislav makes a total of three 90-degree turns and walks four
    segments.</p>
<p>When walking in some direction, the number of steps he takes
    must be equal to one of the four chosen integers and each
    integer must be used exactly once. Depending on the order in
    which Kornislav uses the integers, his walk will make various
    shapes, some of which don’t contain enclosed rectangles. Write
    a program that calculates the largest rectangle the turtle can
    enclose with its walk.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains four positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A, B, C$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$D~ (0 &lt; A, B, C, D &lt; 100)$</span>, the
    four chosen integers.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the largest area.</p>
