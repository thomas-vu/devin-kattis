</div>Johnny has been roped into a fantasy soccer league and
    needs your help to set up the best team.

    <p>He has a list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    players that are on his fantasy team (no goalkeepers in this
    league). He also knows what country they’re from, what league
    they play in, and what team they play for.</p>
<p>He doesn’t know much about soccer, but he does know these
    things:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>If two players are from the same country, a link between
        the two players will have a synergy score of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If two players are in the same league, a link between
        the two players will have a synergy score of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If two players are on the same team, a link between the
        two players will have a synergy score of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If two players are from the same country and in the same
        league, a link between the two players will have a synergy
        score of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If two players are from the same country and on the same
        team, a link between the two players will have a synergy
        score of <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A team can only be in one league and no two teams will have
    the same name unless they are the same team.</p>
<p>He has to place the players on his team into a formation of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> nodes which can be
    represented as an undirected graph. The illustration shows the
    first sample. Therefore, Johnny has to place a player in each
    node of the graph. Given a particular formation and the members
    of Johnny’s team, output whether it is possible for Johnny to
    organize his team to get a perfect team.</p>
<p>A team is a perfect team if and only if every player is
    placed on a node with a synergy score that is greater or equal
    to the node’s degree. A node’s degree is the number of links to
    which it is linked in the formation. A player placed on a node
    in the formation derives synergy from all players placed on
    nodes to which the player is linked in the formation. Thus, a
    node’s synergy score is the sum of the synergy scores of all
    links to which the node is connected.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will contain a single test case. The first line of
    the input will have one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq c \leq 45$</span>). <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> represents the number of edges in
    the formation. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> lines represent the connections
    between nodes represented as two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq a &lt; 10$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq b &lt; 10$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is not equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. Then, the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> lines will be the players on
    Johnny’s team. Each line will contain four strings in the
    following order: player name, nation, league, team, which are
    delimited by a single space. These strings are guaranteed to be
    non-empty and consist of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> alphanumeric characters, which
    includes lower- and uppercase English letters, digits, and
    hyphens.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If a perfect team can be organized by Johnny, print
    <tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt>. Otherwise, print <tt class="ttfamily">no</tt>.</p>
