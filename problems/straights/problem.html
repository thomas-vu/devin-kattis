<div class="problembody">
<p>In poker, a <i class="itshape">straight</i> is a continuous
    sequence of cards, in this case of any length. Your friend John
    makes up a game called straights which is played with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> cards with numbers
    that may repeat, between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^4$</span>. In order to win, you must get
    rid of all of your cards in as little turns as possible. The
    only way to put down more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> card at a time is if the cards are
    strictly in <i class="itshape">descending</i> or <i class="itshape">ascending</i> order.</p>
<p>For example, given eight cards with the numbers: <tt class="ttfamily">1 8 3 6 5 7 2 1</tt>, the minimum number of turns to
    get rid of all of your cards would be: <tt class="ttfamily">3</tt> because you would have 2 straights:
    <tt class="ttfamily">1 2 3</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">5 6 7
    8</tt> and a single card: <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt> left
    over.</p>
<p>Can you find the minimum number of turns required for you to
    win?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of two lines. The first contains the number
    of cards that you are given <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 10^4$</span>). The second line consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space separated
    integers each with a value between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^4$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum number of turns to win.</p>
