<div class="problembody">
<p>At the start of class, I like to call roll. I like to go
    through my list of students in alphabetical order. Where
    possible, I like to call students by their first names. Of
    course, if two students have the same first name, I have to
    also give the last name so they know who I’m calling. Write a
    program to help me out. Given a class roll, it is going to tell
    how I should call the names.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> names, one per line, terminated
    by the end of file. Each line contains a first and a last name
    for a particular person. First and last names use <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> letters (a–z), always starting
    with an uppercase letters first followed by only lowercase
    letters. No two people will have exactly the same first and
    last names.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the list of names, one per line, sorted by last name.
    If two or more people have the same last name, order these
    people by first name. Where the first name is unambiguous, just
    list the first name. If two people have the same first name,
    also list their last names to resolve the ambiguity.</p>
