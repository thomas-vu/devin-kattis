<div class="problembody">
<p>Snow White and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    dwarfs live in the forest. While the dwarfs mine away Snow
    White hangs around social networks.</p>
<p>Each morning the dwarfs form a long line and go whistling
    away to the mine. Snow White runs around them and snaps
    pictures to upload onto her favorite social network.</p>
<p>When dwarfs enter the mine, Snow White goes back to their
    house and goes through the pictures, selecting pretty ones.
    Each dwarf has a colored cap, and there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> different colors. A picture is
    pretty if more than half caps on it are of the same color. In
    other words, if there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> dwarfs on the picture, it is
    pretty if strictly more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$K /
    2$</span> dwarfs have same colored caps.</p>
<p>Write a program that will check for a set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> pictures if they are pretty, and
    what color is dominating if they are.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \leq N \leq 300\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq C \leq 10\, 000$</span>), the number of dwarfs and the
    number of colors. The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (inclusive), colors of dwarves
    hats, ordered the way they formed the line that morning. The
    third line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq 10\,
    000$</span>), the number of pictures. Next <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines contain two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq A \leq B \leq N$</span>). Each line describes one picture.
    On it there are all dwarves starting from <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>-th all the way to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>-th.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines. For
    each picture output “<tt class="ttfamily">no</tt>” if Snow
    White doesn’t think the picture is pretty, and “<tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>”,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is the color
    dominating on the picture, if she does.</p>
