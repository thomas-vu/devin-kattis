<p>As we know, the security of the RSA problem relies on the
    difficulty of factoring integers. Generally, the RSA modulus is
    generated as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Pick two large prime integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compute <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = p \cdot
        q$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally speaking, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> are large enough (e.g.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1024$</span>-bit primes), then
    it is infeasible to factorize <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, which is our only known strategy
    to break the security of RSA.</p>
<p>The problem with this strategy, however, is that if we have
    two modulus <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = p \cdot
    q$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n’ = p \cdot
    q’$</span> for <span class="tex2jax_process">$q \ne q’$</span>,
    then we can compute <span class="tex2jax_process">$p = \gcd (n,
    n’)$</span>, thus factoring both <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n’$</span>. See <a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/q/76757">https://crypto.stackexchange.com/q/76757</a>
    for some recent researches on this topic, the most recent
    research can factors <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    in <span class="tex2jax_process">$172$</span> in RSA
    certificates.</p>
<p>Usually, the cause of such collision is poor randomization
    in the devices used to generate the random primes. Some ways to
    mitigate the issue is discussed in the question linked
    above.</p>
<p>If you have a huge collection of, for example, 340 million
    integers, it would be completely infeasible to compute the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\gcd $</span> of each pair.
    Instead, a <em>batch GCD algorithm</em> is needed. Common
    implementation of that algorithm is the following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Divide the set of modulus into two sets <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> of roughly equal sizes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use divide and conquer, compute the product <span class="tex2jax_process">$\prod A$</span> of all elements in
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, as well as the
        product <span class="tex2jax_process">$\prod B$</span> of
        all elements in <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>.</p>
<p>Using one of the fast integer multiplication algorithms
        based on FFT, this step can be done in time <span class="tex2jax_process">$\tilde O(n)$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the total number of bits
        representing the numbers in the input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compute <span class="tex2jax_process">$\gcd (\prod
        A,\prod B)$</span>. With the half-GCD algorithm, this step
        can also be done in time <span class="tex2jax_process">$\tilde O(n)$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If there’s any pair <span class="tex2jax_process">$a\in
    A$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b\in B$</span> with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\gcd (a, b)&gt;1$</span>, this
    algorithm would detect that pair. Otherwise, the algorithm
    recurses down to the sets <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>.</p>
<p>In this problem, you will be solving a much simpler instance
    with smaller size of integers: Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \dots , a_ n$</span>, determine if
    there exists any pair with <span class="tex2jax_process">$\gcd
    (a_ i, a_ j)&gt;1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \le 10^6$</span>, the second line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i \le 10^{10}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print the string “<tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt>” or “<tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt>” on a
    line.</p>
