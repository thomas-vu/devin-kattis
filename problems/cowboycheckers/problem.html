<p>Theta likes to play a board game called Cowboy Checkers,
    also known under the name “Nine Men’s Morris.” This strategy
    board game, which dates at least to the Roman Empire, is played
    by two players on a grid with <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span> intersections, or points, as
    shown on the left in Figure 1. Each player has nine pieces
    represented by white and black colors. During the initial phase
    of the game, players take turns placing pieces on the board at
    unoccupied intersections. Once all pieces have been placed,
    players take turns moving pieces. Pieces can be moved along the
    lines of the board from one intersection (or corner) to any
    connected open intersection (or corner).</p>
<p>The goal of the game is to take one’s opponent’s pieces,
    which is accomplished by forming “mills,” which consist of
    three pieces that are either horizontally or vertically
    adjacent. For instance, Figure 1 shows two mills: white
    has a mill consisting of the pieces on <tt class="ttfamily">e3</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">e4</tt>, and
    <tt class="ttfamily">e5</tt>, and black has a mill consisting
    of the pieces on <tt class="ttfamily">f2</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">f4</tt>, and <tt class="ttfamily">f6</tt>.</p>
<p>Each time a player forms a mill they can take one piece from
    their opponent. Thus, a desirable position, which almost always
    results in a win, is a “double mill”: in this position, the
    player whose turn it is can move one piece from one mill such
    that it closes (completes) another mill. In the next move, the
    player can move back, closing the first mill again and
    reopening the second. For instance, in Figure 1, White has
    created a double mill: the move <tt class="ttfamily">e3</tt> to
    <tt class="ttfamily">d3</tt> would close a mill consisting of
    <tt class="ttfamily">d1</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">d2</tt>, and
    <tt class="ttfamily">d3</tt> while simultaneously creating an
    open mill <tt class="ttfamily">e4</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">e5</tt>.</p>
<p>Theta is pretty good at spotting double mills - can you
    write a program that does the same?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. This test case
    consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> lines with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> characters each. The
    letters <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">W</tt> denote black and white pieces, respectively.
    The character <tt class="ttfamily">.</tt> denotes an open
    corner or intersection, except in the center of the board,
    where it has no significance. The characters <tt class="ttfamily">|</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">-</tt> are used to
    denote connector lines that may not contain any pieces. All
    inputs represents valid positions as far as which points may
    contain pieces, as displayed on the left in Figure 1.
    There may be up to nine black and up to nine white pieces on
    the board.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If White has at least one double mill, output <tt class="ttfamily">double mill</tt>, else output <tt class="ttfamily">no double mill</tt>!</p>
