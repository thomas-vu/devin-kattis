<div class="problembody">
<p>A certain manufacturing process consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> different machines, through which
    raw material pass in order until it becomes the manufactured
    goods. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th machine
    takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ i$</span> seconds to
    process a good when input.</p>
<p>A good moves automatically through the system once input
    into the first system. To give the system some tolerance with
    regards to timing, each machine <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> has an input area where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K_ i$</span> items waiting to be
    processed by that machine can be stored. This means that when
    machine <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> finishes
    processing a good, it is either passed on immediately to
    machine <span class="tex2jax_process">$i + 1$</span> if it is
    free, and otherwise placed in its input area until that machine
    becomes free and can process the good. If a machine finishes a
    good, and the next machine is currently being used, and its
    input area is full, the system shuts down. If a machine and the
    one after it finish processing an item at the same time, that
    item does not need to be put in the input area of the second
    machine first.</p>
<p>You just got a huge order of goods, and now wonder – how
    quickly can you finish manufacturing these goods, without the
    system shutting down? You have an infinite supply of raw
    materials, and can choose at which times you put in items in
    machine <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 1\, 000$</span>), the number of machines, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 10^9$</span>), the number of
    items that should be produced.</p>
<p>The next line contains the processing times <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\dots $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le T_ i \le 10^9$</span>), which are all
    integers.</p>
<p>The next line contains the sizes of the input areas
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\dots $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K_ N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le K_ i \le 10^9$</span>), which are all
    integers. Note that the first machine does not have an input
    area.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of seconds it takes to manufacture all the
    requested items. Manufacturing is considered complete when the
    last item has been processed by the last machine.</p>
