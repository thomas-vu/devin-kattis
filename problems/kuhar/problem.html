<p>Lisa works as a waitress in a restaurant. Tonight is her
    birthday so Lisa asked the chef to prepare his special meal for
    her friends. The chefâ€™s meal is made of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> ingredients. To prepare one
    serving of the meal he needs a certain amount of each
    ingredient.</p>
<p>There are some ingredients already available in the kitchen
    and Lisa will buy the rest at the grocery store. The store has
    all the necessary ingredients, each coming in smaller and
    larger packages. Lisa has <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> dollars and wants to spend them so
    that the chef can make the most servings of his meal.</p>
<p>For example, consider the first sample data below. For
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$99$</span> dollars Lisa will buy
    three smaller and one larger package of the first ingredient,
    as well as one smaller and two larger packages of the second
    ingredient <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3\cdot 10 + 1 \cdot
    11 + 1 \cdot 10 + 2 \cdot 24 = 99)$</span>. The chef will then
    have <span class="tex2jax_process">$51$</span> units
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(8 + 3 \cdot 10 + 1 \cdot
    13)$</span> of the first ingredient and <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span> units <span class="tex2jax_process">$(20 + 1 \cdot 6 + 2 \cdot 17)$</span> of the
    second ingredient, enough for <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> servings.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le M
    \le 100\, 000$</span>. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> positive integers, information
    about one ingredient. These specify, in order:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$10 \le X \le 100$</span>, the amount of
        the ingredient needed in one serving;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le Y \le 100$</span>, the amount of
        the ingredient already available in the kitchen;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ M$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le S_ M &lt; 100$</span>,
        the size of the smaller package at the store;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ M$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$10 \le PM &lt; 100$</span>,
        the price of the smaller package;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ V$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ M &lt; S_ V \le
        100$</span>, the size of the larger package; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ V$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ M &lt; P_ V \le
        100$</span>, the price of the larger package.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
