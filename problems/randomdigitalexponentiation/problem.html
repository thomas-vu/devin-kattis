<div class="description"></div>
</div>In a random digital exponentiation (RDE) cipher, each
    digit of a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is
    raised to a certain power which is determined by a randomly
    chosen encryption key. The encrypted number is the number that
    results when each digit is replaced with its power at the
    corresponding place value.
    <p>For instance, for <span class="tex2jax_process">$a =
    243$</span> and an encryption key of <tt class="ttfamily">7 4
    3</tt>, the encrypted value <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$b = 2^7 \cdot 10^2 + 4^4 \cdot 10 + 3^3 =
    15\, 387$</span>.</p>
<p>Given a plaintext value <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and an encrypted value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, find the encryption
    key that was used!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p><span class="mbox" style="width:">The input will contain a
    single test case containing two numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le a \le b \le 2\, 147\, 483\, 647$</span>).</span></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the encryption key, which is the list of exponents to
    which each digit in <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
    was raised, separated by spaces, starting from the leftmost
    digitâ€™s exponent. Each exponent should be a natural number. You
    are guaranteed that the encryption key exists and is
    unique.</p>
