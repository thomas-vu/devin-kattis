<div class="problembody">
<p>It is not an easy job to be a coach of a football team. (A
    note to our American friends: football = soccer.) Especially if
    you do not coach great teams like Ajax, Inter, Dynamo (ok, fill
    in the name of your dream team), but only a mediocre one like
    FC Dead Horse, playing in the second league. The season is
    almost over, only a few matches are left to play. All of sudden
    the team manager comes to you and tells you bad news: the main
    sponsor of your club is not happy with your results and decided
    to stop sponsoring your team, which probably means the end of
    your club. The sponsor’s decision is final and there is no way
    to change it unlessunless your team miraculously wins the
    league.</p>
<p>The manager left you in deep thought. If you increase the
    number of practices and offer players a generous bonus for each
    match, you may be able to win all the remaining matches. Is
    that enough? You also have to make sure that teams with many
    points lose against teams with few points so that in the end,
    your team will have more points than any other team. You know
    some of the referees and can bribe them to manipulate the
    result of each match. But first you need to figure out how to
    manipulate the results and whether it is possible at all.</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> teams
    numbered 1 through <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>,
    your team has the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. The current number of points of
    each team and the list of remaining matches are given. Your
    task is to find out whether it is possible to manipulate each
    remaining match so that the team <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> will finish with strictly more
    points than any other team. If it is possible, give one
    possible way to manipulate the results. In every match, the
    winning team gets 2 points, the losing team gets 0. If the
    match ends with a draw, both teams get 1 point.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input file consists of several blocks (at most 20). Each
    block has the following form: The first line contains two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 100$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le M \le 1000$</span>.
    The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    integers (each between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span>, inclusively)
    separated by spaces giving the current number of points of
    teams <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \dots , N$</span>
    respectively. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines describe the remaining
    matches. Each line corresponds to one match and contains two
    numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$a \not= b$</span>) identifying the teams
    that will play in the given match. There is a blank line after
    each block. The last block is followed by a <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> on a separate line.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each block in the input file, output one possibility how
    to manipulate the remaining matches. Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> numbers separated by spaces or end
    of line characters; the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th number will represent the
    result of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    match. Indicate the victory of the first team by 0, a draw by
    1, and the victory of the second team by 2. If it is not
    possible to manipulate the remaining matches so that the team
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> would win the league,
    output a single line containing the word ‘<tt class="tt">NO</tt>’.</p>
