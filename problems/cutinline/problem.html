<div class="problembody">
<p>You are currently standing in line, waiting to buy some
    algorithm books at the university book shop. Of course, the
    line is incredibly long. Even worse, some of your fellow
    university students keep cutting in line! In fact, this has
    been going on for such a long time you are unsure of your
    current position in the line.</p>
<p>Up until now, you have memorized how the line looked when
    you entered the line, what people have entered the line, and
    what people have left the line. Not only the first person in
    the line can leave – someone in the middle can leave if they
    grow tired of waiting.</p>
<p>Write a program where you can input the data of how the line
    changed, and output how the line currently looks.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 1000$</span>), the number of
    people currently in line. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains the names of the
    person initially in the line, from the first to the last.</p>
<p>The next line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le C \le 1000$</span>) – the number of people who entered or
    left the line.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> lines
    contain the events, in the order that the events happened. If
    someone cut in line, the event will be <tt class="ttfamily">cut
    a b</tt>, where <tt class="ttfamily">a</tt> is the name of the
    person who cut in line, and <tt class="ttfamily">b</tt> is the
    name of the person they stand in front of. If someone left the
    line, the event will be <tt class="ttfamily">leave a</tt>,
    where <tt class="ttfamily">a</tt> is the name of the person who
    left the line.</p>
<p>All names are single words of length at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> containing only lower-case
    letters <tt class="ttfamily">a-z</tt>. No two people will have
    the same name. Nobody will ever leave the queue and then enter
    it again.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the names of everyone in the line after all the
    events in the order they stand from first to last, one name per
    line.</p>
<h2>Explanation of sample 1</h2>
<p>In the first example, the queue looks like this throughout
    the events:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">a b c d</tt> (initial)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">a e b c d</tt> (<tt class="ttfamily">e</tt> cuts in front of <tt class="ttfamily">b</tt>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">a e b c</tt> (<tt class="ttfamily">d</tt> leaves)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">e b c</tt> (<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt> leaves)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">f e b c</tt> (<tt class="ttfamily">f</tt> cuts in front of <tt class="ttfamily">e</tt>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
