<div class="problembody">
<p>Jennifer was nominated to be neighborhood watch captain and
    is now in charge of managing the watch for her street.</p>
<p>Jennifer’s street consists of houses on only one side of the
    road. She has a plan of which houses will be a <i class="itshape">neighborhood watch house</i> and wants to know how
    safe the plan is. A <i class="itshape">walk</i> from one house
    to another house (not necessarily distinct) is considered
    <i class="itshape">safe</i> if there is at least one house
    along the walk that is a neighborhood watch house. The
    <i class="itshape">safety rating</i> of a plan is the number of
    walks that are safe on the street. Since a walk is either safe
    or not safe, when traveling in either direction, it is not
    counted twice in the safety rating.</p>

<p>Tell Jennifer the safety rating of her plan.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 200\, 000$</span>), which is
    the number of houses on the street, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq K \leq N$</span>), which is the
    number of neighborhood watch houses in Jennifer’s plan. The
    houses are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, \dots ,
    N$</span>.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> lines
    describe the neighborhood watch houses. Each of these lines
    contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq H \leq N$</span>), which is the house
    number of a neighborhood watch house. The house numbers are
    given in strictly increasing order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the safety rating of Jennifer’s plan.</p>
