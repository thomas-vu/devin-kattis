<div class="description"></div>
</div>My birthday is coming up and traditionally Iâ€™m serving
    pie. Not just one pie, no, I have a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> of them, of various tastes and of
    various sizes. <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> of my
    friends are coming to my party and each of them gets a piece of
    pie. This should be one piece of one pie, not several small
    pieces since that looks messy. This piece can be one whole pie
    though.
    <p>My friends are very annoying and if one of them gets a
    bigger piece than the others, they start complaining. Therefore
    all of them should get equally sized (but not necessarily
    equally shaped) pieces, even if this leads to some pie getting
    spoiled (which is better than spoiling the party). Of course, I
    want a piece of pie for myself too, and that piece should also
    be of the same size.</p>
<p>What is the largest possible piece size all of us can get?
    All the pies are cylindrical in shape and they all have the
    same height <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, but the
    radii of the pies can be different.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>One line with a positive integer: the number of test cases
    (at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span>). Then for
    each test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le N,F\le 10\, 000$</span>: the number
        of pies and the number of friends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i$</span> with
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le r_ i\le 10\,
        000$</span>: the radii of the pies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line with the largest
    possible volume <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> such
    that me and my friends can all get a pie piece of size
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span>. The answer should be
    given as a real number with an absolute error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span>.</p>
