<p>Maarja wants to buy a rectangular piece of land and then
    construct three buildings on that land.</p>
<p>The boundaries of the buildings on the ground must have
    rectangular sizes <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1 \times
    b_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_2 \times
    b_2$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_3 \times
    b_3$</span>. They can touch each other but they may not
    overlap. They can also be rotated as long as their sides are
    horizontal and vertical.</p>
<p>What is the minimum area of land Maarja has to buy?</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: Illustration of the two test scenarios

          scenario the <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \times

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of multiple test scenarios. The first
    line of input contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le t \le 1000$</span>), the number of scenarios. Then follow
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> scenarios. Each
    scenario consists of a single line, containing six integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_3$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a_1,b_1,a_2,b_2,a_3,b_3 \le
    10^9$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test scenario, output the minimum area of land such
    that Maarja can construct the three buildings.</p>
