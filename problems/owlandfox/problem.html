<p>Fox Mithra has finally learned the numbers and he is now
    familiar with the concept of ‘one’, ’two’, ‘three’ and also
    even ‘zero’, ‘minus one’, ‘minus two’ and so on. Really, an
    achievement for such a small fox. He took the textbook and
    copied the integers from the book one by one from the smallest
    to the biggest on the wall of his enclosure in the ZOO.</p>
<p>“Look, there is something wrong with your sequence on the
    wall”, said the owl who just landed on the branch above
    Mithra’s head. “You should put <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> between <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$22$</span>, there.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because the importance of a number is judged by the sum of
    its digits. <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> is
    therefore less important than <span class="tex2jax_process">$22$</span> and it is more important than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>. And obviously,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> should be equally
    close to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$22$</span> because its sum of
    digits differs only by one from both <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$22$</span>.”</p>
<p>“I see,” replied Mithra, “you are really clever. Can you
    help me please to rearrange the sequence correctly? Each time I
    tell you a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> you
    will tell me the closest smaller number with sum of digits less
    by one than the sum of digits of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.”</p>
<p>“With pleasure,” nodded the owl majestically.</p>
<p>Your task is to imitate the owl’s task. Given an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> you have to find the
    biggest integer which is smaller than <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> with sum of digits less by one
    than the sum of digits of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the number of test cases
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 100\, 000$</span>). The
    descriptions of the test cases follow:</p>
<p>Each case consists of a line containing a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 100\, 000$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case print on a separate line the number
    demanded by fox Mithra.</p>
