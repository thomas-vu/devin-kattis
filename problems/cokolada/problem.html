<div class="problembody">
<p>A new type of chocolate arrived in the local shop. The
    chocolate comes in bars, each bar consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> squares. Bars are factory made and
    only come in sizes which are full powers of two. In other words
    a single bar has <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, 4, 8, 16,
    \dots $</span> squares.</p>
<p>To fully asses the quality of chocolate Mirko must sample at
    least <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> squares. His
    friend Slavko would also like to try some of the chocolate.
    Since Mirko is in a hurry to try the chocolate himself, he
    decides to break the bar he bought in pieces, such that he has
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> squares, and
    leaves the rest (if any) to Slavko. The bars are a bit brittle,
    so Mirko can break them only on their exact center. In other
    words, from one bar with <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> squares, he can get two bars with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D/2$</span> squares.</p>
<p>Write a program that will determine the minimal number of
    breaks Mirko must perform in order to obtain exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> squares (not
    necessarily in one piece). Also, determine the smallest bar
    size Mirko must buy in order to have at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> squares.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input will contain one integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq K \leq 1\, 000\, 000)$</span>,
    number of squares Mirko must sample.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output should contain two
    integers, separated by a single space. The first integer is the
    smallest bar size Mirko must buy. The second the smallest
    number of breaks.</p>
