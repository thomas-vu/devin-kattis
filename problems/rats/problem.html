<p>The <b class="bfseries">RATS</b> (Reverse Add Then Sort)
    function takes as input a decimal integer (usually with digits
    in increasing order) and returns a decimal integer with digits
    in increasing order</p>
<p>To compute the value:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Reverse the digits of the input value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the reversed value to the input value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sort the digits of the sum into increasing order
        (dropping any leading zeroes).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre>
    RATS(12334444): 12334444 + 44443321 = 56777765 -&gt; 55667777
    RATS(44556): 44556 + 65544 = 110100 -&gt; 111
</pre>
<p>This problem deals with sequences where the first value is
    arbitrary and each succeeding value is the RATS of the previous
    value. For example:</p>
<pre>
    12334444, 55667777, 123334444, 556667777, 1233334444, 5566667777, ...
    123, 444, 888, 1677, 3489, 12333, 44556, 111, 222, 444, 888, ...
</pre>
<p>The first sequence is the <b class="bfseries">creeper</b>.
    It provably goes to infinity in this regular pattern. The
    second sequence enters a cycle which first repeats a value at
    the tenth term of the sequence. It is conjectured that every
    RATS sequence either eventually enters the creeper and goes to
    infinity or cycles as in the second sequence.</p>
<p>Write a program which computes the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> terms of a RATS sequence given the
    starting value. Your program should also detect if the sequence
    repeats a value in the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> terms or enters the creeper in the
    first <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> terms.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single decimal integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 70$</span>), which is the number
    of data sets that follow. Each data set should be processed
    identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single space,
    followed by the number of terms to compute (including the
    initial value), <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>,
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le M \le 60$</span>), a
    single space, followed by the initial value for the RATS
    sequence, a decimal integer with digits in increasing order.
    The decimal integer will have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span> digits although intermediate
    terms may have more.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is one line of output.</p>
<p>If the sequence enters the <i class="itshape">creeper</i>
    (has a term of the form <tt class="ttfamily">1233+4444</tt> or
    <tt class="ttfamily">5566+7777</tt>) in the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> terms, the output is the data set
    number, a space, the upper case letter <tt class="ttfamily">C</tt>, a space and the index of the first term to
    enter the creeper.</p>
<p>If the sequence repeats a value in the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> terms, the output is the data set
    number, a space, the upper case letter <tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>, a space and the index of the first repeated
    term.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the output is the data set number, a space, and
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$M^{\text {th}}$</span> term
    of the sequence.</p>
<p>In the first two cases the index of the initial term is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
