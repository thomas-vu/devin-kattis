<p>You are on an <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \times
    m$</span> grid where each square on the grid has a digit on it.
    From a given square that has digit <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> on it, a Move consists of jumping
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> squares in one
    of the four cardinal directions. A move cannot go beyond the
    edges of the grid; it does not wrap. What is the minimum number
    of moves required to get from the top-left corner to the
    bottom-right corner?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that
    your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The
    first line of input contains two space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n, m \le 500$</span>), indicating the size of the grid. It
    is guaranteed that at least one of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines will
    each consist of <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    digits, with no spaces, indicating the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \times m$</span> grid. Each digit is
    between <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">9</tt>, inclusive.</p>
<p>The top-left corner of the grid will be the square
    corresponding to the first character in the first line of the
    test case. The bottom-right corner of the grid will be the
    square corresponding to the last character in the last line of
    the test case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer on a line by itself representing the
    minimum number of moves required to get from the top-left
    corner of the grid to the bottom-right. If it isnâ€™t possible,
    output <tt class="ttfamily">-1</tt>.</p>
