<p>Hansel and Gretel do not listen to their teacher at school.
    Instead they secretly play a game called K-In-A-Row. One day in
    the evening they started to argue who had won more games that
    day. They collected all the papers they had used for playing
    the game and they started to count how many times each of them
    had won. But it was very tedious and they were sleepy. Help
    them to count how many games each of them had won.</p>
<p>K-In-A-Row is played in a square grid with <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> times <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> squares. Two players alternate in
    their moves. A player chooses an empty square and fills in
    his/her sign (Hansel uses cross ’<tt class="tt">x</tt>’ and
    Gretel uses circle ’<tt class="tt">o’</tt>). The game is won by
    the player who first places at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> his/her own signs in a row (either
    horizontally, vertically or in one of the two diagonal
    directions). The game stops immediately after one of the
    players completes <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> of
    his/her signs in a row; thus it may never happen that both
    players have completed <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    of their signs in a row. If no player creates such a row,
    nobody wins.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the number of games <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>. It is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> blocks, each describing one game.
    Each block starts with a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>. Numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> give the size of the grid
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq M,N\leq 200$</span>) and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K\geq 2$</span> is the length of
    the required row. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> characters describe the situation
    after the end of the game. Character ’<tt class="tt">.</tt>’
    denotes an empty field, characters ’<tt class="tt">x</tt>’ and
    ’<tt class="tt">o</tt>’ denote fields marked by Hansel and
    Gretel respectively. You may assume that the input is
    correct.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output file consists of two numbers separated by a colon
    ’<tt class="tt">:</tt>’. The first number denotes the number of
    the games won by Hansel, the second one gives the number of the
    games won by Gretel.</p>
