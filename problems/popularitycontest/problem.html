<p><em>It’s not about what you know, but who you know</em>. A
    famous saying – but is it true? You start looking around
    yourself, pondering what lies behind the success of some of
    your friends. Could it be that life is just one big popularity
    contest? Are all the hours you spend learning algorithms better
    used networking?</p>
<p>Slightly saddened by these thoughts, you realize that this
    is at least a question you can answer thanks to all those
    algorithm hours. Among your <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> friends, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> pairs of them are friends with
    each other. You have ordered your friends in increasing order
    by how successful you think they are in life. For the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th friend (starting
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>) in this order,
    we let <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> be their
    <em>success factor</em>. Similarly, we call the number of
    friends someone has their <em>popularity factor</em>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span>.</p>
<p>To investigate the matter, you decide to compute the
    <em>marketability coefficient</em> of each friend, defined as
    the difference between their popularity factor and success
    factor.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 1\, 000$</span>), the number of your friends, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le M \le \frac{N(N - 1)}{2}$</span>), the
    number of friendships.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines each
    contains one of the friendships, given as two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a \neq b \le N$</span>,
    denoting that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>’th
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>’th of your friends
    are friends.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers – the marketability
    coefficients of all your friends.</p>
