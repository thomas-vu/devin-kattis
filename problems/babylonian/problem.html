<p>More than <span class="tex2jax_process">$4\, 000$</span>
    years ago, the ancient Babylonians used a numerical system that
    is well known for being the first positional numerical system.
    In such a system, a non-negative integer is represented by a
    sequence of digits such that the value of a digit depends both
    on itself and on its position within the sequence. The
    Babylonians used a base-<span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span> system known as sexagesimal (not
    unlike our own base-<span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    decimal system) where each ‘digit’ can take values between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$59$</span>, inclusive. (The Babylonians
    didn’t have a digit to represent <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>; instead they would just leave the
    digit position empty.) Akin to the Egyptians at the time, the
    Babylonians carved their equations in solid clay, which allows
    us to read them thousands of years later.</p>
<p>Your history professor, Dr. X, has asked you to decipher the
    Babylonian numbers he has found during a recent excavation and
    to convert them into our own decimal numerical system. As you
    are a competent translator, you have no problem deciphering the
    Babylonian writing, but you now need to write a program that
    takes the sexagesimal notation and converts it to decimal.</p>
<p>Fortunately, each clay tablet discovered by Dr. X contains
    numbers in a clean format where digits corresponding to
    consecutive powers of <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span>
    are separated by commas, with the most significant digit on the
    left. For instance, one tablet contains the Babylonian number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1{,}24{,}9$</span> in
    sexagesimal, which converts to <span class="tex2jax_process">$5\, 049$</span> in decimal, since
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \cdot 60^2 + 24 \cdot 60^1 + 9
    \cdot 60^0 = 5\, 049$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 20$</span>), the number of test cases to
    follow.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines represents a single tablet
    containing a number in sexagesimal format. This number is a
    non-empty sequence of digits separated by commas. Nonzero
    digits can be any integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$59$</span> (inclusive), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> is represented by an empty string.
    The sexagesimal number does not begin with a comma, contains at
    least one nonzero digit, and consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> digits in total, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq D \leq 8$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing the decimal
    representation of the sexagesimal number.</p>
