<p>After an unsuccessful attempt at claiming power peacefully,
    Borko has decided to tear down Mirko’s village hall, which was
    built for him out of cardboard by his loyal servants.</p>
<p>For this he will use Mirko’s microprocessor (which was
    stolen from him by Borko’s friend Zvonko), a bucket of water
    and a bag of sodium. He will enter the time of the “explosion”
    into the microprocessor, and it will drop the sodium in the
    water after the time is up.</p>
<p>Borko knows the current time and when he wants the
    explosion. He is not very fond of arithmetic and Zvonko is
    currently playing with marbles in his back yard so he can’t
    help him.</p>
<p>Write a program that calculates the time to the explosion
    (this is the time Borko will enter into the microprocessor).
    The time Borko wants is at least one second and at most 24
    hours.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the current time in
    hh:mm:ss format (hours, minutes, seconds). The hours will be
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$23$</span> (inclusive) and the
    minutes and seconds between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$59$</span>. The second line contains the
    time of the explosion in the same format.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the desired time on a single line in the hh:mm:ss
    format.</p>
