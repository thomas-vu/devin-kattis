<p>Ómar is ordering pizza for his family. He is very lazy and
    therefore wants to minimize the time and effort put into
    ordering the pizza. He doesn’t care what toppings go on the
    pizza as long as the basics are there: bread, cheese and sauce.
    Luckily there is a service which suits Ómar perfectly.</p>
<p>The company Flýtibaka provides a service for people that
    want their pizza quickly. A website, app or phone call is not
    used to make an order at Flýtibaka. It is instead sufficient to
    text their phone number with a message which includes all the
    toppings desired by the customer on the pizza. Unless otherwise
    specified in the order, the pizzas will be made with regular
    dough and topped with cheese and sauce. It is unnecessary to
    include more info in the order as Flýtibaka has collected data
    on the locations and appetites of everyone in the world. That
    is how the company can determine the size of the order and
    where to deliver it.</p>
<p>Now it is time to make the order and Ómar cannot be bothered
    to write a long list of ingredients. He just wants to send as
    short of a text as he possibly can, while still being happy
    with the food. What should Ómar send?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There is no input in this task.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the text that Ómar should write in his text
    message.</p>
