<div class="problembody">
<p>Nicole has started her own business which she runs from her
    home office. While on some days she works hard, on others she
    struggles to find the motivation to get back to the grind.
    Fortunately, she has come up with a new system: she sets a
    target to work <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> minutes
    every workday, and if she hits her target she rewards herself
    by watching an episode of her favourite TV show.</p>
<p>Nicole quickly realized that on the days when she worked
    extra hard, she would then feel burnt out the next day and not
    even try to hit her target. All that extra work didn’t count in
    her new system! She thus decided that she would adjust her
    target each day by subtracting <span class="tex2jax_process">$p\% $</span> of how far she went above her
    previous day’s target from the baseline target <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (even if this makes the new target
    negative). Similarly, when she goes below her target, she would
    adjust the next day’s target by adding <span class="tex2jax_process">$p\% $</span> of how much she fell short to
    the baseline target <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>.
    To keep things simple, she’ll round up (towards positive
    infinity) when this gives a non-integer target.</p>
<p>As an example, if Nicole set her target to <span class="tex2jax_process">$m = 240$</span> minutes and worked
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_1 = 300$</span> minutes the
    first day (<span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span> minutes
    above her target), and set <span class="tex2jax_process">$p =
    50$</span>, then she would watch an episode and set the second
    day’s target to <span class="tex2jax_process">$210$</span>
    minutes (<span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> minutes less
    than the baseline target). If she then worked <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_2 = 200$</span> minutes the second day,
    missing her new target by <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> minutes, she wouldn’t earn an
    episode that day. She would then set her third day’s target to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> minutes above the
    baseline of <span class="tex2jax_process">$240$</span> minutes,
    making the next target <span class="tex2jax_process">$245$</span> minutes.</p>
<p>Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, and how long Nicole works for the
    first <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> workdays that
    she tries out this system, how many episodes of the show will
    she watch?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a line consisting of the three
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq
    m \leq 1\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq p
    \leq 100$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n
    \leq 20\, 000$</span> as described in the problem statement,
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    consisting of a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq w_ i \leq 1\, 440$</span>, the number of minutes that
    Nicole worked on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> workday of her system.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of days that Nicole reaches her target and
    watches an episode of her show.</p>
