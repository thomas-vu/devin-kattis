<div class="problembody">
<p>The ants of a particular colony are in search of food.
    Unfortunately hidden dangers are all around the colony which
    makes foraging difficult. There are traps, obstacles, and
    predators lurking about. Fortunately, the colony has the
    perfect ant for the job. Max is neither a smart ant nor an
    efficient ant but he has got blind luck on his side. In all of
    his wanderings, he has always managed to stay on safe ground
    and he (eventually) always finds a source of food to report
    back to the colony.</p>
<p>The problem is that Max rarely takes anything resembling an
    optimal (shortest) route to find a food source. However, Max
    can reliably bring back the exact details of the (often winding
    and convoluted) path that he took to get to the food source.
    Your job is to help the colony by finding the optimal route
    located within Max’s convoluted directions to allow the colony
    to forage more efficiently.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first integer in the input, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100$</span>, denotes the
    number of paths to food that Max has reported back. This is
    followed by a blank line and then descriptions of each of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> paths. Each path
    description begins with an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq s \leq 60$</span>), which denotes the number of steps
    taken in the path. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> lines contain directional steps
    expressed as upper-case characters N, E, S, and W corresponding
    to steps taken in the directions north, east, south, and west
    respectively. Each step moves Max one unit of distance. Max’s
    paths always start at the colony and end at a food source.
    Between each pair of path descriptions is a blank line.</p>
<p>When searching for an optimal path, the only directional
    steps that may be taken are ones that have previously been
    taken by Max, or the same steps in reverse.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each given path, give the number of steps found to be in
    an optimal (shortest) path.</p>
