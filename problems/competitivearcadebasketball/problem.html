<p>You’re attending a arcade basketball competition, where the
    objective is to score as many points as possible until the time
    runs out. The announcer has informed the crowd that their
    scoreboard is broken, so they don’t have a way to keep track of
    all the scores. As a seasoned programmer, you feel you can whip
    up a program that can keep track of the names of the players
    and the amount of points they’ve scored, announcing the
    winner(s) at the end of the contest.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains three integers: the number of
    participants <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100\, 000$</span>);
    the minimum number <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> of
    points required to win the contest (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le p \le 10\, 001$</span>); and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, the number of lines
    with player names and points (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le m \le 200\, 000$</span>). The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contain the names of the
    participants, each mentioned exactly once. Each name consist of
    no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>
    alphanumerical characters. The remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each contain the name of a
    participant, followed by how many points they scored
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the names of those participants who reached the
    minimum required score, one per line! Output “<tt class="ttfamily">&lt;Winner&gt; wins!</tt>” for each winner. Output
    the winners in the order in which they’ve reached the required
    score. If no one reaches the minimum required score, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">No winner!</tt>” (including the
    exclamation mark!).</p>
