<p>John is a student working as a part-time barista at the
    micro kitchen of his school department. He operates the
    espresso machine at the kitchen to make espresso and latte for
    students seeking energy to study.</p>
<p>Today, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    students coming to the micro kitchen to place an order. An
    order is noted with an espresso shot number <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> ranging between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, and an optional letter <tt class="tt">L</tt> that indicates that the student wants to have a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-shot latte. For
    example, an order <tt class="tt">2</tt> means a <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>-shot espresso, and an order
    <tt class="tt">3L</tt> means a <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-shot latte.</p>
<p>Making an <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-shot
    espresso consumes <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
    ounces of water. Making a latte requires steaming milk and
    consumes one additional ounce of water, e.g. making a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-shot latte consumes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> ounces of water. The
    espresso machine at the micro kitchen has a water tank of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> ounces that is full at
    the beginning of the day. John refills the water tank to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> ounces whenever the
    remaining water in the tank is not enough to fulfill the next
    studentâ€™s order. John fulfills the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> orders one by one without changing
    their order.</p>
<p>How many times do John have to refill the water tank today
    in order to serve all the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> students?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input has two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 100$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$10
    \leq s \leq 200$</span>). The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain a digit between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> followed by an optional letter
    <tt class="tt">L</tt> to describe an order. The orders are to
    be fulfilled in the given order as they appear in the
    input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of times John has to refill the water tank
    of the espresso machine.</p>
