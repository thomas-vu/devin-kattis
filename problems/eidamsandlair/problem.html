<div class="problembody">
<p>In your base you have dug through sand and rock to construct
    a deep pit with stairs and a lift. The pit goes very deep into
    the ground where on various floors you leave equipment and on
    the deepest levels you leave cheeses to age, particularly
    Eidam. You often take a stroll downstairs, but wonder whether
    it is faster to go up to the surface by foot or take a lift for
    a part or all of the trip.</p>
<p>You know the position and the speed of yourself and the
    lift. The surface floor is numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, positive numbers denote
    underground floors by their distance to the surface. You are
    alone on the Mars so only you will use the lift. Also, it takes
    (you and lift) almost no time to start and stop moving so you
    will neglect these. When the lift is called to multiple floors,
    it moves to them in the same order in which it was called. The
    lift is not very special – once you enter it, you may order it
    to go to an arbitrary floor. In such case, any previous calls
    must be processed first.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first input line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le T \le 10^4$</span>), the number of test cases.</p>
<p>Next <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines contain
    one test case each. Each test case is composed of four
    integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y_ p$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L_ p$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y_ s$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$L_ s$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le Y_ p, L_ p \le 10^9$</span> are the
    initial floors of you and the lift, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; Ys, Ls \le 10^6$</span> are the times
    it takes you and of the lift to move by one floor,
    respectively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print a single integer – the minimum
    time it takes you to move from your initial floor to the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>’th floor.</p>
<h2>Sample Explanation</h2>
<p>The first sample contains two test cases. In the first one,
    you will rather walk to <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>’th floor than to wait for the lift
    which is <span class="tex2jax_process">$18$</span> floors
    away.</p>
<p>In the second test case, an example of the fastest way is
    when you call the lift and walk 1 floor upstairs in the
    meantime, then you call the lift to <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>’th underground floor and wait for
    the lift which you then take to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>’th floor.</p>
