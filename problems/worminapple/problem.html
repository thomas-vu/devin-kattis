<p>Willy the Worm was living happily in an apple – until some
    vile human picked the apple, and started to eat it! Now, Willy
    must escape!</p>
<p>Given a description of the apple (defined as a convex shape
    in 3D space), and a list of possible positions in the apple for
    Willy (defined as 3D points), determine the minimum distance
    Willy must travel to get to the surface of the apple from each
    point.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There will be a single test case in the input. This test
    case will begin with a line with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$4
    \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>), which tells the number of points
    describing the apple.</p>
<p>On the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    will be three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\, 000 \le x,y,z \le 10\, 000$</span>),
    where each point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y,z)$</span>
    is either on the surface of, or within, the apple. The apple is
    the convex hull of these points. No four points will be
    coplanar.</p>
<p>Following the description of the apple, there will be a line
    with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le q \le 100\, 000$</span>),
    which is the number of queries – that is, the number of points
    where Willy might be inside the apple. Each of the following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines will contain
    three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\, 000 \le x,y,z \le 10\, 000$</span>),
    representing a point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y,z)$</span> where Willy might be. All of
    Willy’s points are guaranteed to be inside the apple.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query, output a single floating point number,
    indicating the minimum distance Willy must travel to exit the
    apple. The absolute error of your answer should be less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span>.</p>
