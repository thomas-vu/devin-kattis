<p>For many students, getting a ticket to The ICPC World Finals
    is a huge achievement, and <i class="itshape">The 2019 ICPC
    Asia Danang Regional Contest</i> is a chance to make their
    dream come true. For some others, they just like to stretch
    their brains and solve interesting problems.</p>
<p>We – <i class="itshape">the scientific committee</i>
    understand that, and we tried our best to set up a problemset
    that is interesting and diverse in both topics and difficulty.
    For a few months, we called for problem proposals from many
    people and received <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
    easy problems, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> medium
    problems and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> hard
    problems. Using these proposals, we want to create a problemset
    which:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Consists of <b class="bfseries">exactly</b> <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> problems,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
        easy problem,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
        medium problem,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
        hard problem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your task is to check whether it is possible to create such
    a problemset using the available problems.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0
    \le a, b, c \le 10, 1 \le n \le 20)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print ‘YES’ if it is possible to create a problemset
    satisfying above requirements, and ‘NO’ otherwise.</p>
<h2>Explanation of sample data</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>In the first sample, the committee do not have any easy
        problem. Thus, they cannot create a problemset with at
        least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> easy
        problem.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the second sample, the committee can use <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> easy problems, <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> medium problems and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> hard problems to
        create a problemset with exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span> problems.</p>
