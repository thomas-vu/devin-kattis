<div class="problembody">
<p>You have found an old jigsaw puzzle in the attic of your
    house, left behind by the previous occupants. Because you like
    puzzles, you decide to put this one together. But before you
    start, you want to know whether this puzzle was left behind for
    a reason. Maybe it is incomplete? Maybe the box contains pieces
    from multiple puzzles?</p>
<p>If it looks like a complete puzzle, you also need to know
    how big your work surface needs to be. Nothing worse than
    having to start a jigsaw over because you started on a small
    table.</p>
<p>The box does not tell you the dimensions <span class="tex2jax_process">$w \times h$</span> of the puzzle, but you
    can quickly count the three types of pieces in the box:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Corner pieces, which touch two of the edges of the
        puzzle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Edge pieces, which touch one of the edges of the
        puzzle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Centre pieces, which touch none of the edges of the
        puzzle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do these pieces add up to a complete jigsaw puzzle? If so,
    what was the original size of the jigsaw puzzle?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq c,e,m\leq 10^9$</span>), the
        number of corner pieces, edge pieces, and centre pieces
        respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If there exist numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$w\geq h\geq 2$</span> such that the original
    size of the jigsaw puzzle could have been <span class="tex2jax_process">$w\times h$</span>, then output a single line
    containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>. Otherwise, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”.</p>
<p>If there are multiple valid solutions, you may output any
    one of them.</p>
