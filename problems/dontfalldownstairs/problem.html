        King Whomp Descending His Fortress
      </div>
</div>
<p>King Whomp is walking down Whomp Fortress to fight Mario. In
    order to get down, he must descend down a staircase consisting
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> steps. The height
    of every subsequent step is less than or equal to the step
    before (so that he can reach Mario at the end of the
    staircase).</p>
<p>However, King Whomp is injured these days, so he cannot walk
    down steps that have a height difference of more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Thus, his Whomp
    underlings keep adjusting the staircase by removing one brick
    from the current step, which decreases the height of the
    current step by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, or
    adding one brick to the next step to raise its height by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> in order to keep their
    Majesty safe.</p>
<p>Every brick that the Whomps add or remove costs one unit of
    effort for them. Can you help them calculate the minimum amount
    of effort needed to help King Whomp walk from Whomp Fortress to
    Mario, who is on the ground at height 0?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input is an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 1\, 000 \, 000$</span>), representing the number of
    steps.<br/>
    The second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_ n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a_ i \leq 1\, 000 \,
    000$</span>) representing the height of each step where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1 \geq a_2 \geq \ldots a_
    n$</span>. Note that King Whomp needs to travel from the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-th step to the floor,
    which is at height 0.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span>, the minimum effort of the Whomp
    underlings to guarantee King Whomp can safely walk down Whomp
    Fortress.</p>
