        Rook and knight icons by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece">Cburnett</a>

<p>On a chess board of <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
    rows and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> columns there
    is a lone white rook surrounded by a group of opponent’s black
    knights. Each knight attacks <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> squares as in a typical chess
    game, which are shown in the figure – the knight on the red
    square attacks the <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>
    squares with a red dot. The rook can move horizontally and
    vertically by any number of squares. The rook can safely pass
    through an empty square that is attacked by a knight, but it
    must move to a square that is not attacked by any knight. The
    rook cannot jump over a knight while moving. If the rook moves
    to a square that contains a knight, it may capture it and
    remove it from the board. The black knights never move. Can the
    rook eventually safely move to the designated target
    square?</p>
<p>The figure illustrates how the white rook can move to the
    blue target square at the top-right corner in the first sample
    case. The rook captures one black knight at the bottom-right of
    the board on its way.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq r, c \leq 750$</span>). Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines describes one row of the
    board using <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>
    characters: the letter ‘<tt class="tt">R</tt>’ represents the
    white rook, a ‘<tt class="tt">K</tt>’ represents a black
    knight, a dot ‘<tt class="tt">.</tt>’ represents an empty
    square, and the letter ‘<tt class="tt">T</tt>’ represents the
    white rook’s target square. There is exactly one ‘<tt class="tt">R</tt>’, exactly one ‘<tt class="tt">T</tt>’, and at least
    one ‘<tt class="tt">K</tt>’ on the board. It is guaranteed that
    the white rook starts in a square that is not attacked by any
    knight. The target square may be attacked by a knight, in which
    case the knight must be captured before the rook can safely
    move to the target square.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <tt class="tt">yes</tt> if the white rook can move to
    the target square, or <tt class="tt">no</tt> otherwise.</p>
