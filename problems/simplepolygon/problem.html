<p>Write a program that constructs a polygon from a given set
    of points in the plane. Each point of the set has to be a
    vertex of the polygon, and the polygon must not have any other
    vertices. No two line segments of the polygon may have any
    point in common, except for the middle vertex of two
    consecutive line segments. For example, given the points on the
    left-hand side, a valid polygon is shown on the right-hand
    side:</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=11cm]{polygon-fig}" src="/problems/simplepolygon/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:11cm"/>
</center>
<p>A valid polygon is guaranteed to exist, and any valid
    polygon will be accepted as a correct answer. Moreover, no two
    points will share the same location, and not all points will be
    collinear.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq c \leq 200)$</span>, the number of
    test cases. Then follow the test cases, one per line.</p>
<p>Each test case starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3
    \leq n \leq 2\, 000)$</span>, the number of given points. Then
    follow, on the same line, the coordinates of the points. Each
    point is specified by two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\, 000$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>, inclusively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print a single line containing a
    permutation of the numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. Each of these numbers
    represents the index of a point, in the same order as given in
    the input. When drawing line segments between consecutive
    points in the order given by this permutation, the result must
    be a valid polygon.</p>
