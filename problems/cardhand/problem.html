        Sample Input 2 (cc by-sa NCPC 2016)
      </div>
</div>When dealt cards in the card game Plump it is a good idea
    to start by sorting the cards in hand by suit and rank. The
    different suits should be grouped and the ranks should be
    sorted within each suit. But the order of the suits does not
    matter and within each suit, the cards may be sorted in either
    ascending or descending order on rank. It is allowed for some
    suits to be sorted in ascending order and others in descending
    order.

    <p>Sorting is done by moving one card at a time from its
    current position to a new position in the hand, at the start,
    end, or in between two adjacent cards. What is the smallest
    number of moves required to sort a given hand of cards?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 52$</span>), the number of cards in the hand. The
    second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    pairwise distinct space-separated cards, each represented by
    two characters. The first character of a card represents the
    rank and is either a digit from <tt class="ttfamily">2</tt> to
    <tt class="ttfamily">9</tt> or one of the letters <tt class="ttfamily">T</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">J</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Q</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">K</tt>, and <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt> representing Ten, Jack, Queen, King and Ace,
    respectively, given here in increasing order. The second
    character of a card is from the set {<tt class="ttfamily">s</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">h</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">d</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">c</tt>} representing
    the suits spades <span class="tex2jax_process">$\spadesuit
    $</span>, hearts <span class="tex2jax_process">$\heartsuit
    $</span>, diamonds <span class="tex2jax_process">$\diamondsuit $</span>, and
    clubs <span class="tex2jax_process">$\clubsuit
    $</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum number of card moves required to sort the
    hand as described above.</p>
