<p>Oops! The latest shipment of laptop batteries has a minor
    issue. Nothing major, just a slight tendency to explode when
    being pushed too hard, that’s all. Some of our customers keep
    pestering us about this tiny defect however, and the media just
    won’t give us a break.</p>
<p>Shipping new batteries to all customers is very expensive,
    so we’ve come up with an ingenious way to fix this issue. See,
    the thing is, the battery can only explode when it’s being
    pushed too hard (i.e. when it is delivering too many Amperes).
    So we’re going to include an ammeter (a device measuring the
    current) and shut down the laptop when critical levels are
    reached.</p>
<p>There’s a slight problem though. We need to figure out what
    that critical level is. We now know from, umm, “field testing”,
    that the laptop can explode when delivering <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> milliAmperes (mA), but it is
    possible that explosion could occur below that level. We need
    to figure out the highest level which is still safe, since
    turning off the laptop is not very appreciated by customers, so
    we don’t want to do it needlessly.</p>
<p>You have been given two laptop batteries and a testing
    device. The testing device will make the battery connected to
    it (one battery can be connected at a time) deliver
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> mA, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is an integer. The testing device
    is constructed in such a way that the battery will always
    explode if there’s any risk of explosion at that current.</p>
<p>You don’t want to spend too much time testing (time is
    money), so you want to run as few tests as possible while still
    figuring out the maximum current which is safe. Given Murphy’s
    Law (everything that can go wrong will go wrong), we want to
    minimize the number of tests needed in the worst case.</p>
<p>Remember that you only have access to two batteries, so when
    the first has exploded, you cannot afford to blow the second
    one up without being sure you’ve found the correct answer.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of multiple lines, one line per case (at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> test cases). Each
    line contains a single positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4\, 711$</span> inclusive, giving the
    current at which the battery is known to explode. Input is
    terminated by a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, which should not produce any
    output.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, print one line containing the worst-case
    number of tests to perform when using an optimal testing
    strategy.</p>
