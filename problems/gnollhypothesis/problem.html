<p>You are a huge fan of the RPG <em>The Eldest Scrolls:
    Earthrim</em> and know all of the game’s internal mechanics.
    For instance, when spawning a new monster, each of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> different types of
    monsters in the game has some fixed probability of appearing,
    and you know exactly what this probability distribution over
    monster types is.</p>
<p>However, in the latest update the developers seem to have
    changed the way monsters are spawned. After some testing and
    reverse engineering, you realise that instead of spawning all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> types of monsters,
    each spawn location only has a spawn pool of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> monster types. These spawn pools
    are chosen randomly at the start of the game, independently for
    each spawn location, with every monster type having the same
    chance of being chosen for the spawn pool. And apparently a
    developer was lazy with adjusting the spawn chances. Instead of
    normalising the spawn chances of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> chosen types, the developer
    decided that if a type of monster is not chosen, its spawn
    chance is added to the next chosen monster type in the list of
    types (and if monster types at the end of the list are not
    chosen, their spawn chances are added to the first chosen
    monster type in the list). For example, Figure 1 shows a
    small example with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=5$</span>
    monsters, a possible random choice of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k=3$</span> of those monsters, and the
    resulting spawn probabilities for those <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> monsters.</p>
<p>After the update, some monster types seem to appear less
    often than before, and some more often (for instance now there
    seem to be Gnolls all over the place). You believe that the new
    spawning logic may be responsible for this by having changed
    the effective spawn chances of the monsters. In order to test
    this hypothesis, you decide to compute these effective spawn
    chances after the update.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le k \le n \le 500$</span>), the
        number of different types of monsters and the number of
        monsters that are randomly chosen for the spawn pool of
        each spawn location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1, s_2,
        \ldots , s_ n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i
        \ge 0$</span> for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sum ^{n}_{j=1}s_ j = 100$</span>),
        where <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> is the
        spawn chance in percent for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th type in the list of monster
        types. Every real number has at most six digits after the
        decimal point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> real numbers, the effective spawn
    chance in percent of each type of monster. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th number in your output should
    correspond to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th
    type of monster. Your answers should have an absolute or
    relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
