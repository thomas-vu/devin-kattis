<p>In this modern world, people are moving into more and more
    tightly packed cities. This is a development that the hermits
    of the world love – if people concentrate in cities, that
    leaves much more space for hermits! Well, a development that
    almost all hermits love. Hermiticism is a calling that can
    develop in anyone, even those who like getting their morning
    gourmet coffee from urban luxury cafés. This restricts the
    urban hermit to locations in cities where not <em>too</em> many
    people live.</p>
<p>One of those hermits, Urban, is planning a move to
    Stockholm. He has already identified what city district he
    wants to move to. The district consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> different streets.</p>
<p>After buying his morning coffee, Urban likes taking solitary
    morning walks up and down the street he lives on. This means
    that he wants to pick a street that not too many people live
    on, but also one that not too many busy streets cross. More
    formally, each street <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    has a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> of
    people that live on it. Urban wants to live on a street where
    the total number of people who live on the street and all
    streets that cross it is minimal, which he thinks is the
    quietest street. Can you help him find which one it is?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 1\, 000$</span>), the number of streets in the
    district. The next line contains the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, \dots , a_ N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a_ i \le 10^6$</span>), the number of
    people who lives on the streets.</p>
<p>The next line contains the number of pairs of streets that
    cross <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le M \le \frac{N(N - 1)}{2}$</span>). The
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines each
    contain the one-based indices of two streets that cross each
    other. The streets are numbered in the same order as the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer – the number of the quietest street.
    If there are several quietest streets, he prefers the one with
    the lowest index.</p>
