<p>The Department of National Defence (DND) wishes to connect
    several northern outposts by a wireless network. Two different
    communication technologies are to be used in establishing the
    network: every outpost will have a radio transceiver and some
    outposts will in addition have a satellite channel.</p>
<p>Any two outposts with a satellite channel can communicate
    via the satellite, regardless of their location. Otherwise, two
    outposts can communicate by radio only if the distance between
    them does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>,
    which depends of the power of the transceivers. Higher power
    yields higher <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> but
    costs more. Due to purchasing and maintenance considerations,
    the transceivers at the outposts must be identical; that is,
    the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> is the
    same for every pair of outposts.</p>
<p>Your job is to determine the minimum <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> required for the transceivers.
    There must be at least one communication path (direct or
    indirect) between every pair of outposts.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of test cases. The
    first line of each test case contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le S \le 100$</span>, the number of
    satellite channels, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S &lt; P
    \le 500$</span>, the number of outposts. <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> lines follow, giving the
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$x,y$</span>) coordinates of
    each outpost in km (coordinates are integers between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, output should consist of a single line giving
    the minimum <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> required
    to connect the network. Output should be specified to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> decimal points.</p>
