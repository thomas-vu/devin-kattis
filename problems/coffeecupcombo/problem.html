<div class="problembody">
<p>Jonna is a university student who attends <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lectures every day. Since most
    lectures are way too simple for an algorithmic expert such as
    Jonna, she can only stay awake during a lecture if she is
    drinking coffee. During a single lecture she needs to drink
    exactly one cup of coffee to stay awake.</p>
<p>Some of the lecture halls have coffee machines, so Jonna can
    always make sure to get coffee there. Furthermore, when Jonna
    leaves a lecture hall, she can bring at most two coffee cups
    with her to the following lectures (one cup in each hand). But
    note that she cannot bring more than two coffee cups with her
    at any given time.</p>
<p>Given which of Jonna’s lectures have coffee machines,
    compute the maximum number of lectures during which Jonna can
    stay awake.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 10^5$</span>), the number of lectures Jonna
    attends.</p>
<p>The second line contains a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th letter is <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt> if there is a coffee machine in the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th lecture hall, and
    otherwise it is <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print one integer, the maximum number of lectures during
    which Jonna can stay awake.</p>
