<p>We’re all familiar with harshad numbers. For this problem,
    you will ... what’s that? You <em>aren’t</em> familiar with
    harshad numbers? They’re also known as Niven numbers – does
    that ring a bell?? Anything???</p>
<p>Well, it’s a simple enough concept. A <em>harshad</em>
    number is a number which is evenly divisible by the sum of its
    digits. For example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>
    is a harshad number: the sum of its digits is <span class="tex2jax_process">$2+4=6$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span> is divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$156$</span> is also a harshad number, since
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1+5+6=12$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$156 = (12)(13$</span>).
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$157$</span> is NOT a harshad
    number since it is not divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1+5+7=13$</span>.</p>
<p>OK, let’s start over.</p>
<p>We’re all familiar with harshad numbers. For this problem,
    you will be given a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and must find the smallest harshad
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$\geq n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single line containing a positive
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \leq 1\, 000\, 000\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the smallest harshad number greater than or equal to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
