<div class="problembody">
<p>A large field has a dog and a gopher. The dog wants to eat
    the gopher, while the gopher wants to run to safety through one
    of several gopher holes dug in the surface of the field.</p>
<p>Neither the dog nor the gopher is a math major; however,
    neither is entirely stupid. The gopher decides on a particular
    gopher hole and heads for that hole in a straight line at a
    fixed speed. The dog, which is very good at reading body
    language, anticipates which hole the gopher has chosen, and
    heads at double the speed of the gopher to the hole, where it
    intends to gobble up the gopher. If the dog reaches the hole
    first, the gopher gets gobbled; otherwise, the gopher
    escapes.</p>
<p>You have been retained by the gopher to select a hole
    through which it can escape, if such a hole exists.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains four real numbers: the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> coordinates of the
    gopher followed by the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> coordinates of the dog.
    Subsequent lines of input each contain two real numbers: the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> coordinates of a
    gopher hole. All coordinates are in metres, with exactly three
    digits after the decimal point.</p>
<p>There are not more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span> gopher holes and all
    coordinates are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\,
    000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$+10\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Your output should consist of a single line. If the gopher
    can escape the line should read “<tt class="ttfamily">The
    gopher can escape through the hole at (<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>,<span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>).</tt>” identifying the
    appropriate hole.</p>
<p>Otherwise the output line should read “<tt class="ttfamily">The gopher cannot escape.</tt>” If the gopher may
    escape through more than one hole, any one will do. If the
    gopher and dog reach the hole at the same time, the gopher
    escapes successfully.</p>
