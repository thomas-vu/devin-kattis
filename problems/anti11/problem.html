<p><em>Note that this is an easier version of the problem
    <b class="bfseries">anti11hard</b></em>.<br/></p>
<p>Danny Ocean likes many things: casinos, elaborate heists,
    and complicated romantic relationships. But it’s a little-known
    fact that Danny loves binary strings most of all — binary
    strings of any length and composition. Recently, however, he
    has developed an unfortunate allergy to binary strings
    containing the substring <tt class="ttfamily"><b class="bfseries">11</b></tt>. He is optimistic that there are still
    plenty of other binary strings for him to enjoy, but he’s not
    sure exactly how many, so he has hired you to write a program
    to find out.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 100$</span>) representing the
    number of test cases. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines, each of which contains a
    single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10\,
    000$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    lines, one per case. The output for a given case is the number
    of binary strings of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> that do not contain <b class="bfseries"><tt class="ttfamily">11</tt></b> as a substring.
    Since these values can be quite large, output each value mod
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(10^9 + 7)$</span>.</p>
