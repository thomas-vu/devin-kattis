<p>The United Cinema Crowd Association of Stockholm plans to
    have a showing of <em>Old computer scientists and their
    pieings</em> at the local KTH Royal Institute of Technology
    cinema.</p>
<p>Not until far too late did the auditor of the association
    point out that the board had booked far too many groups of
    visitors to the theater, which fits at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> visitors.</p>
<p>In total, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> groups of
    visitors signed up for the showing. It was decided to let the
    groups enter the theater one at a time, in the same order in
    which they signed up for the showing. If there are too few
    empty seats when a group comes, the group gets angry and
    leaves.</p>
<p>Given the sizes of all the visiting groups, determine how
    many groups will <b class="bfseries">not</b> be accepted into
    the theater.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains the integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 100$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le M \le 50$</span>), the number of seats in the theater and
    the number of visiting groups.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> integers – the size of each
    visiting group in the order in which they signed up for the
    showing. A group consists of between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> visitors.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single number – the number of groups that will
    <b class="bfseries">not</b> be accepted to the showing.</p>
