<p>Yraglac is expecting to have a child in the near future.
    Being a mathematically-minded person, he would like his child’s
    name to be a palindrome – that is, reads the same when read
    forward and backward. Given a name, he would like to count the
    number of ways he can create a palindromic name by removing
    zero or more letters. For example, given the name “abcdb”, he
    can remove the letters “a” and “c” to get the palindrome “bdb”.
    Of course, the resulting name must not be empty. The answer
    might be very large so you should output the answer modulo
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 007 = 10^9 +
    7$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 10$</span> giving the number of test
    cases. Each test case consists of a single name with length
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000$</span> inclusive,
    containing only lowercase letters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the
    answer modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\,
    007$</span>.</p>
