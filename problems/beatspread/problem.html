<p>Superbowl Sunday is nearly here. In order to pass the time
    waiting for the half-time commercials and wardrobe
    malfunctions, the local hackers have organized a betting pool
    on the game. Members place their bets on the sum of the two
    final scores, or on the absolute difference between the two
    scores.</p>
<p>Given the winning numbers for each type of bet, can you
    deduce the final scores?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of test cases.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines follow, each
    representing a test case. Each test case gives <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, non-negative integers
    representing the sum and (absolute) difference between the two
    final scores. You can assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le s, d \le 1\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line giving the two final
    scores, largest first. If there are no such scores, output a
    line containing “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”. Recall
    that football scores are always non-negative integers.</p>
