<p>Banks often charge overdraft fees if you attempt to withdraw
    more money from your account than is available in your current
    balance. Given a sequence of deposits and withdrawals (and
    assuming each deposit and withdrawal is immediately reflected
    in your balance), determine the minimum (non-negative) starting
    balance you need to ensure that you will not be charged any
    overdraft fees over the course of the sequence.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1{,}000$</span>), which is the
    number of transactions.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^6 \le t \le 10^6$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$t \neq 0$</span>). These are the
    transactions, in the order that they occur. A positive number
    represents a deposit, a negative number represents a
    withdrawal. No two transactions occur simultaneously.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single non-negative integer, which is the minimum
    non-negative balance you must start with in your account in
    order to avoid any overdraft fees.</p>
