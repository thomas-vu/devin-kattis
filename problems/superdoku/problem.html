<p>Alice and Bob are big fans of math. In particular, they are
    very excited about playing games that are related to numbers.
    Whenever they see a puzzle like Sudoku, they cannot stop
    themselves from solving it. The objective of Sudoku is to fill
    a <span class="tex2jax_process">$9\times 9$</span> grid with
    digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3\times 3$</span>) subgrids
    that compose the grid (also called “boxes”, “blocks”, or
    “regions”) contains all of the digits from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>. The puzzle setter provides a
    partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a
    single solution.</p>
<p>After many years of solving Sudoku problems, Alice and Bob
    are tired of Sudoku. They have been trying to develop a harder
    variation of Sudoku, which they are calling Superdoku. In
    Superdoku, the grid is bigger – <span class="tex2jax_process">$n\times n$</span> instead of just
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9\times 9$</span>. However, the
    “block” constraints are impossible to formulate when there are
    no further constraints on <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Therefore, there are no block
    constraints in Superdoku. Instead, the goal is simply to make
    sure that each column and each row in the grid contains all of
    the integers from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. After playing for a
    while in the standard way (where any of the grid cells may have
    previously been filled in), they decide that the game is too
    difficult and they want to simplify it. Therefore, they decide
    to make the initial grid further constrained. They constrain
    the board by filling in the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> rows completely.</p>
<p>Alice and Bob both believe that Superdoku is solvable.
    However, since <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> could
    be very big, it may still take a long time to figure out a
    solution. They don’t want to spend too much time on this single
    game, so they are asking for your help!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line
    lists two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le k \le n$</span>, denoting the size of
    the grid <span class="tex2jax_process">$(n\times n)$</span> and
    the number of rows <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    that are already filled in. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space-separated integers, denoting
    the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> given rows.
    All integers in these <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    lines are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output either “<tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt>” or “<tt class="ttfamily">no</tt>” on the first line, indicating if there is a
    solution. If there is no solution, do not output anything more.
    If there is a solution, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> more lines, each containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space-separated
    integers, representing a solution. If there are multiple
    solutions, output any one of them.</p>
