<p>HARDFLOR, Inc. is in the business of laying terrazzo floors.
    They charge by the square foot of flooring laid. They are very
    good at laying floors, but they have some difficulty in
    calculating the areas because floors come in many shapes and
    sizes, e.g.,</p>

<p>One rule that John Hardflor, the company’s founder, made
    years ago was to “never bid on a job that doesn’t have square
    corners”. And, the company still follows that rule. They are
    still having trouble estimating areas, however, and they would
    like to have a computer program developed which would assist
    them in this endeavour.</p>
<p>The company’s estimator would like to go out on a potential
    job and measure the dimensions of the room and code them in the
    following way: He starts with an arbitrary corner. He lists a
    succession of direction distance pairs. (Directions are always
    <tt class="ttfamily">N</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">S</tt>,
    <tt class="ttfamily">E</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">W</tt> and
    distances are always in feet). e.g. a room with dimensions as
    shown</p>

<p>might be coded with the following set of pairs: <tt class="ttfamily">[(N,9),(E,16),(N,4),(E,7),(S,13),(W,23)]</tt>.</p>
<p>Write a program which will determine the area.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$4 \leq N &lt; 12$</span>) indicating the
    number of corners in the room. The second line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> direction-distance
    pairs where each is given as a concatenation of the direction
    with the distance. Each distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> satisfies <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d &lt; 100$</span>.</p>
<p>Assume that the input is correct – you will always end up at
    the corner on which you started, that every direction is at a
    right angle from the previous direction (including the first
    direction from the last direction), and that the room being
    described is a simple polygon (i.e. lines do not cross and the
    only lines that touch are those at one of the described
    corners).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line with the text <tt class="ttfamily">THE
    AREA IS &lt;A&gt;</tt> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{&lt;A&gt;}$</span> is the square
    footage of the room.</p>
