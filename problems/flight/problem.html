<div class="problembody">
<p>The airline company NCPC Airways has flights to and from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cities, numbered from
    1 to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, around the
    entire world. However, they only have <span class="tex2jax_process">$n - 1$</span> different flights (operating
    in both directions), so in order to travel between any two
    cities you might have to take several flights. In fact, since
    the management has made sure that it’s possible to travel
    between any pair of cities, there is exactly one set of flights
    a passenger have to take in order to travel between two cities
    (assuming you want to use the same airline).</p>
<p>Recently many of NCPC Airways frequent flyers have
    complained that they have had to change flights too often to
    get to their final destination. Since NCPC Airways doesn’t want
    to loose their customers to other airline companies, but still
    keep the nice property of their flights, they have decided to
    cancel one of their current flights and replace it with another
    flight. Help the company by writing a program which finds the
    best flight to cancel and the best new flight to add so that
    the maximum number of flight changes a passenger might have to
    make when travelling between any pair of cities in which NCPC
    Airways operates is minimized.</p>
<p><em>The input will be constructed so that it is always
    possible to improve the maximum number of flight changes
    needed.</em></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line in the input contains the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$4 \leq n \leq 2\, 500$</span>), the number
    of cities NCPC Airways operates in. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n - 1$</span> lines specifying the flights.
    Each flight is given as a pair of cities <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le a, b \le n$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should consist of three lines. The first line
    should contain an integer, the minimum number of flights needed
    to take when travelling between any pair of cities after
    changing one of the flights. The second line should contain two
    integers, specifying the two cities between which the flight
    should be canceled. The third line should contain two integers,
    specifying the two cities where a new flight should be
    added.</p>
<p>If there are more than one optimal solution, any one of them
    will be accepted.</p>
