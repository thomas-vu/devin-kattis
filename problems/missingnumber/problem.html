<div class="problembody">
<p>You are teaching kindergarten! You wrote down the numbers
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, in order, on a whiteboard. When
    you werenâ€™t paying attention, one of your students erased one
    of the numbers.</p>
<p>Can you tell which number your mischievous student
    erased?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le n \le 100$</span>), which is the
    number of numbers that you wrote down.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains a string of digits, which
    represents the numbers you wrote down (minus the one that has
    been erased). There are no spaces in this string. It is
    guaranteed to contain all of the numbers from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, in order, except for the single
    number that the student erased.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the number that the tricky
    student erased.</p>
