<div class="problembody">
<p>You are an elephant working for peanuts. The job that you do
    is to walk around the packing plant and make sure that peanuts
    are being packed correctly. Peanuts at your plant are packed by
    size — small, medium, and large. You walk around and note every
    peanut that is packed in the wrong type of box, or that is not
    packed in any box, so that your boss (the principal peanut
    packing pachyderm) can know of any problems.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains a sequence of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> test cases. Each case starts
    with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le
    30$</span>, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> box descriptions, one per line. A
    box is described by the real-valued coordinates for two of its
    corners <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1~ y_1~ x_2~
    y_2$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1 &lt;
    x_2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1 &lt;
    y_2$</span>, and the type of peanuts it should hold (small,
    medium, or large). There are no two boxes that overlap or
    touch. After the list of box descriptions is an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le m \le 100$</span>,
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> peanut
    descriptions, one per line. Each peanut is described by a pair
    of real-valued coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$x~
    y$</span> indicating its location, and the type of peanut that
    it is (small, medium, or large). All real-valued inputs are in
    the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0, 300]$</span> and
    have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> digits
    past the decimal point. Input ends when <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = 0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print the size and status of each of the
    peanuts inspected, in the order they are given. If a peanut is
    in a box of the correct size, its status is ‘correct’. If it is
    on the floor, its status is ‘floor’. Otherwise, its status is
    the size of the box that it is in. A peanut just on the edge of
    a box is considered to be inside that box. Print a blank line
    between each pair of test cases.</p>
