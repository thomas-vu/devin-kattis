<p>Latkas Coolacek doesn’t really like doing his mathematics
    homework, he prefers partying with his algorithm buddies and
    finding shortest paths in the city. Unfortunately, his teachers
    aren’t as happy with Latkas ignoring school. Thus, they have
    given him the worst assignment there is; boring, mindless
    geometry calculations!</p>
<p>The task given to Latkas is:</p>
<p>Consider a point <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> in
    the 2D-plane such that the distance between <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 0)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is greater than 1. The unit circle
    (the circle with radius 1 and centre in <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 0)$</span>) has exactly two tangent
    lines (lines touching the circle at a single point, and is
    perpendicular to the radius to that point) which pass through
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>. We then define the
    <em>tangential coordinates</em> of <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>. Write the two lines on the form
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ ix + b_ iy = c_ i$</span> for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i = 1, 2$</span>. The tangential
    coordinates of <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is then
    the 6-tuple <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a_1, b_1, c_1, a_2,
    b_2, c_2)$</span> (or some non-zero scaling thereof). Given
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> points in the plane,
    calculate the tangential coordinates of them all.</p>

<p>Since nobody should have to suffer through an assignment
    this sadistic, you offered to write a program which makes
    Latkas’ homework automatically. In exchange, since Latkas is
    such a good friend, he will make you 20% cooler.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 1\, 000$</span>, the
    number of points.</p>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    of two real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$|X_ i| \le
    10^4, |Y_ i| \le 10^4$</span>. These are the coordinates of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> points.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output should consist of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines - the tangential coordinates
    of every point, in the order given by the input.</p>
<p>The coordinates must be formatted “(<span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1$</span>,<span class="tex2jax_process">$b_1$</span>,<span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1$</span>,<span class="tex2jax_process">$a_2$</span>,<span class="tex2jax_process">$b_2$</span>,<span class="tex2jax_process">$c_2$</span>)”, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, b_1, c_1, a_2, b_2, c_2$</span> are
    real numbers, without any spaces.</p>
<p>Output will be considered correct if all the coordinates are
    within a relative or absolute error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span>.</p>
