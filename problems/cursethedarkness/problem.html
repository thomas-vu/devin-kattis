<div class="problembody">
<p>You are trying to read in a dark room. The room contains
    many candles, but none are lit. You are considering that it
    might be worthwhile to light one, but before you do you want to
    be certain that it will actually light your book. You only get
    to light one and each is bright enough to cast light in a
    radius of <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> meters. You
    are a stubborn reader and you are not willing to move your book
    or one of the candles.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le m \le 50$</span>, giving the number of
    test cases that follow. A test case begins with the real-valued
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X, Y$</span> location of your
    book. This is followed by an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>, giving the
    number of candles in the room and the real-valued <span class="tex2jax_process">$X, Y$</span> locations of each candle. All
    locations are measured in meters. All real values in the input
    are in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1\,
    000$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>
    and have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>
    digits past the decimal point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output “light a candle” if there is a
    candle close enough to cast light on the position of your book.
    Otherwise, output “curse the darkness”.</p>
