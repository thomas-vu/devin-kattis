<div class="problembody">
<p>You are agent B100. A pair of prominently dressed circus
    artists is traveling over the roads of the city and your
    mission is to find out where they are headed. All we know is
    that they started at point <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and that they are heading for one
    of several possible destinations. They are in quite a hurry,
    though, so we are sure they will not take a detour to their
    destination.</p>
<p>Alas, prominently dressed as they may be, the duo is nowhere
    to be seen. Fortunately, you have an exceptional sense of
    smell. More specifically: your nose will never let you down.
    You can actually smell they have traveled along the road
    between intersections <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>.</p>
<p>Where is the elusive duo headed? Or are we still not
    sure?</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: A visual representation of the second
          sample. The duo is travelling from the gray circle to one
          of the two black circles, and you smelled them on the
          dashed line, so they could be heading to 6.

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with three space-seperated integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le n \le 2\, 000$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le 50\, 000$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le t \le
        100$</span>): the number of intersections in the city, the
        number of individual roads between those intersections, and
        the number of possible destinations respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with three space-seperated integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le s, g, h \le n$</span>): the
        intersection the duo started from and the two intersections
        between which the duo has traveled, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$g \neq h$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines with
        three space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a &lt; b \le n$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le d \le 1\,
        000$</span>), indicating that there is a bidirectional road
        between intersections <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> lines with one
        integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le x \le n$</span>): the
        possible destinations. All possible destinations are
        distinct and they are all different from <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is at most one road between a pair of intersections.
    One of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
    describes the road between <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>. This road is guaranteed to be on
    a shortest path to at least one of the possible
    destinations.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with one or more space-separated integers,
        indicating the destinations that the duo can still be
        headed for, in increasing order.</p>
</li>
</ul>
