<div class="problembody">
<p>You are given a tree and a permutation of its vertices. It
    can be proven that for any tree and any pair of
    source/destination nodes, there is some permutation of the
    nodes where the first node is the source, the last node is the
    destination, and the distance between each pair of adjacent
    nodes in the permutation is less than or equal to three. Here
    the distance between two nodes <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> is the number of tree edges that
    must be traversed to get from <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>.</p>
<p>Your job will be to write a verifier for this property.
    Given such a permutation and the tree, validate whether the
    distance between each pair of adjacent nodes in the permutation
    is less than or equal to three.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le t \le 50{,}000$</span>), which is the number of test
    cases.</p>
<p>In each test case, the first line of input contains an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le n \le 100{,}000$</span>), which is the
    number of nodes in the tree. The nodes are numbered from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>
    lines contains a pair of integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le a &lt; b \le n$</span>), representing an edge in the tree
    between nodes <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le p \le n$</span>, all values distinct). This is the
    permutation of the nodes.</p>
<p>The sum of the values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> over all test cases will not
    exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$100{,}000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line with a single
    integer, which is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> if
    the given permutation satisfies the constraint that every pair
    of adjacent nodes in the permutation has distance less than or
    equal to three in the tree. Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> if the given permutation does not
    satisfy this constraint.</p>
