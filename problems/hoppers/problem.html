<div class="problembody">
<p>You are part of an elite hacking group who has just invented
    a new type of malware, called the hoppers. Hoppers can operate
    in any high-security computer networks; however, they can only
    propagate themselves in a very limited way.</p>
<p>A computer network is a set of hosts <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$|V| = N$</span>) and direct links
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$|E| = M$</span>). Each direct link connects
    two different hosts, allowing them to communicate in both
    directions. If a host <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>
    is infected with a hopper, then it will propagate itself to all
    hosts <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> is the set of hosts
    which are connected to any neighbor of <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>. Formally, <span class="tex2jax_process">$W = \{ w \mid \{ (u,v),(v,w)\} \subseteq E
    \} $</span>. The newly-infected host <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> can now proceed to infect other
    hosts in the same manner.</p>
<p>You are trying to infect all hosts in a particular
    high-security network by compromising a single host. Of course,
    a compromised host will be infected with a hopper. Though it
    may be an impossible mission, you realize that you can trick
    the administrator into installing new direct links between
    hosts by submitting IT requests.</p>
<p>Too many requests may arouse suspicion. Find the minimum
    number of IT requests you have to submit to ensure that there
    exists a single host such that if it is infected with a hopper,
    then it will propagate to the entire network.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le N \le 5 \cdot 10^5$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le M \le 5 \cdot
    10^5$</span>. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    lines contain two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le u, v \le N$</span>), representing a direct link between
    hosts <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>. There is at most one direct link
    between any pair of hosts, and no host is directly linked to
    itself.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output contains an integer in a line representing the
    minimum number of IT requests you must send.</p>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>In the first example, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N = 3$</span> hosts and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M = 2$</span> direct links <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ (1,2),(2,3)\} $</span>. In this network,
    there is no way to spread the hopper to all hosts by
    compromising only a single host, e.g., if we compromise host
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, then only hosts
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> are infected, etc. We need to
    submit one IT request to connect <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,3)$</span> to achieve our goal. By doing
    so, if we compromise host <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, all hosts <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> are infected. <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2$</span> (thus,
    host <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> is infected).
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow
    3$</span> (thus, host <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>
    is infected).</p>
