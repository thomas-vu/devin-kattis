<p>Sigga has been following the progress on quantum computers.
    She feels a bit threatened since they might break RSA
    encryption, which is based on primes, and is widely used to
    encrypt messages on the internet today. If this encryption
    system hasn’t been replaced when the first real quantum
    computer sees the light of day, no one will be safe on the
    internet!</p>
<p>Sigga takes this very seriously and decides to make her own
    encryption protocol. Instead of using primes she decides to use
    palindromes. A number is a palindrome if it’s the same read
    forwards and backwards. For example 5, 11, 121 and 9779 are
    palindromes.</p>
<p>To check the safety of the encryption protocol she needs a
    list of palindromes of different sizes. She asks you to find,
    for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, the largest palindrome that
    isn’t greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^k$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There is no input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> there can be one line containing
    two integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> and the
    largest palindrome not exceeding <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^k$</span>. The lines can be printed in any
    order and not all <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> have
    to be printed (but more is better).</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>The solution gets one point for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> in the output that’s correct.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample Inputs</h2>
<p>The sample output contains five lines, one for each
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> in <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1,4,3,10,6\} $</span>. Here we see that
    there isn’t a line for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, but only for <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> numbers. When <span class="tex2jax_process">$k = 4$</span> the second number should be
    the largest palindrome not exceeding <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^4 = 16$</span>, but that’s exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>. A solution printing
    this thus gets one point for <span class="tex2jax_process">$k =
    4$</span>. In the same way we see that it would get three more
    points for <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 3, 10\} $</span>. For
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k = 6$</span> the second number
    should be the largest palindrome not exceeding <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^6 = 64$</span> but the output is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$44$</span> while the answer is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$55$</span> for this <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>. Thus the solution gets no point
    for this <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>. In total a
    solution printing this would get <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> points.</p>
