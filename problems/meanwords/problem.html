<p>Little Timmy got caught by his teacher using some mean
    words. After getting sent to the principal, little Timmy
    learned his lesson - he should do his best to not get caught
    next time!</p>
<p>What Timmy decided to do is to take all the mean words that
    he wants to say, and combine them all together into a single
    "mean" word by getting the average of all the characters in the
    same position across all the words that have a character in
    that position, and then rounding this average down to get the
    character in that position.</p>
<p>Note: The value of a character is its ASCII value, so the
    value of <tt class="ttfamily">a</tt> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$97$</span>, the value of <tt class="ttfamily">b</tt> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$98$</span>
    and so on up to <tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>, which has value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$122$</span>. So when we average
    characters, we are averaging their ASCII values, rounding this
    down to the nearest integer, and then using the corresponding
    character as the result of this averaging.</p>
<p>Help Timmy create his mean mean words!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 1\, 000$</span>), which represents the number of
    words that follow. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contain a single word
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$45$</span> lowercase English
    characters each.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the mean word obtained by following Timmyâ€™s
    procedure.</p>
