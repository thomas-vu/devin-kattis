<p>A land far, far away has N Members of Parliament (MP). They
    had a turbulent and passionate debate on the law on amendments
    to the law on a new referendum on referendums. From Monday to
    Friday, all MPs joyfully came to work and argued all day.</p>
<p>A diligent news reporter photographed MPs at their workplace
    in the heat of the argument every working day of the week. What
    she captured on the photos are pairs of MPs fighting and
    scowling at each other. The five photographs have been
    forwarded to you for thorough analysis.</p>
<p>It is a fact that each MP belongs to one of the <em>two</em>
    political parties. Let’s denote them with letters A and B. Your
    task is to estimate which MP belongs to which party, so that
    the following holds for your estimation: each MP argued with
    <em>at most two distinct members</em> of their own party.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 200\, 000$</span>), the number of MPs. MPs are
    denoted with numbers from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<p>The following five lines describe the photographs taken from
    Monday to Friday. Each of the five lines contains the list of
    pairs of MPs that are arguing on the photograph that day
    (scowling at each other). Stated first is the number of pairs
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq P \leq N/2$</span>), followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> pairs in the form
    “<span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>”, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> are labels of MPs scowling at each
    other. Before each pair there is a double space.</p>
<p>Of course, each MP is stated at most once per line, and no
    MP ever argues with herself.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain an array
    consisting of only characters A and B, so that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>-th character denotes the party of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>-th MP in a division
    that satisfies the given conditions.</p>
<p>Since the solution isn’t going to be unique, output any.</p>
