<div class="problembody">
<p>Particle colliders are difficult to build and experiments
    are costly to run. Before running any real experiments it is
    better to do a simulation to test out the ideas first. You are
    required to write a very simple simulator for this problem.</p>
<p>There are only three particles in this system, and all
    particles are confined to an infinite plane so that they can be
    modelled as circles. Their locations are specified only by the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span> coordinates of their centers
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq 3$</span>). All
    three particles have the same radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, and are initially stationary.</p>
<p>We are given a vector <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ v,
    y_ v)$</span> specifying the direction particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> will move when the experiment
    starts. When particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    hits particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>,
    particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> will start
    moving in the direction perpendicular to the tangent at the
    point of the contact, away from particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. Particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> will cease to exist and be
    converted to radiation. A moving particle that does not hit
    another will continue moving indefinitely.</p>
<p>There are a number of possible scenarios your simulator
    should identify:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> hits
        particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, which in
        turns hits particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> hits
        particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, which in
        turns hits particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> hits
        particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, which
        moves indefinitely;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> hits
        particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, which
        moves indefinitely;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>particle <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> moves
        indefinitely.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains four lines. The first three lines each
    contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$|x_ i|,|y_ i| \leq
    1000$</span>), describing particles <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> in this order. The fourth line
    contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_
    v$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ v$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$|x_ v|, |y_ v| \leq 1000$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; r \leq 50$</span>).</p>
<p>You may assume that no two particles touch or overlap
    initially, and that the distance between the centers of
    particles <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> is greater than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4r$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer giving the number (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>â€“<span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>) identifying the scenarios
    described above.</p>
<p>Although you should take care of your calculations, it is
    guaranteed that the outcome would not change if the initial
    vector <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ v,y_ v)$</span> is
    rotated by one degree either way.</p>
