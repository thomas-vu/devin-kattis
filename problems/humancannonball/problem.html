<p>You are a world-famous circus performer, a human cannonball.
    This means that you climb into a big, fake cannon and launch
    yourself great distances to delight young and old alike. Today,
    you’re not alone. You are at the international human cannonball
    conference and exposition, where hundreds of similar circus
    performers have gathered together to share their experiences
    and practice their craft. While you normally have just one
    cannon to work with, at the conference there are usually lots
    of cannons to examine and try out.</p>
<p>The availability of several cannons creates some interesting
    opportunities for navigating the conference. If you want to
    travel quickly from point <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> to point <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, you could just run straight from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, or, you could run to a nearby
    cannon and launch yourself somewhere else. From there, you can
    continue to run toward your destination or you can continue to
    use cannons in an effort to get to your destination more
    quickly. With cannons positioned like Figure 1, you could
    follow a path like the one in Figure 2 to get from <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. The arrows show places where you
    launched yourself out of a cannon, and the lines show where you
    ran to the next cannon or to your destination.</p>

<p>You run at a rate of 5 meters per second. All cannons launch
    you a distance of 50 meters, in any direction you’d like.
    Climbing into a cannon, launching yourself and landing takes a
    total of 2 seconds. Cannons are not obstacles; if a cannon is
    in your way, you can jump over or run around it without it
    slowing you down. Given your current location, a desired
    destination and the positions of available cannons, you want to
    plan how to get to the destination as quickly as possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input describes a single navigation problem. The first
    line gives a pair of real numbers, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> coordinates where you’re currently
    located. The next line give the real-valued <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> coordinates of the location you’d
    like to reach. This is followed by a line with an integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of cannons
    available. The remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> input lines each contain a pair of
    real values giving the <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> coordinates for a
    cannon. All coordinates are measured in meters, and the value
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> will be between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single line of output, the total number of seconds
    required to reach your destination as quickly as possible. Your
    answer must be accurate to within 0.001 seconds.</p>
