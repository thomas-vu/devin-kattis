<div class="problembody">
<p>Mirko has an array of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <em>different</em> words that he
    wants to encrypt using a substitution cypher.</p>
<p>We encrypt the text using a substitution cypher by first
    choosing a key – a permutation of the English alphabet. Then we
    replace all occurrences of letter ‘<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>’
    with the first letter of the key, all occurrences of letter
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">b</tt>’ with the second letter of the
    key, and so on until letter ‘<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>’.</p>
<p>Besides the words, Mirko has an array <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> consisting of numbers from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> given in a certain order (in other
    words, array <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> is a
    permutation of numbers from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>). Mirko wants to pick a key such
    that the array of words after encrypting and lexicographic
    sorting corresponds to array <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>. More precisely, he wants the word
    initially located at <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_
    i$</span> to be at location <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> after encryption and sorting.</p>
<p>Let’s recall that the lexicographic word order is the order
    in which the words appear in the dictionary. If we are
    comparing two words, going from left to right, we search for
    the first position in both words where the letters differ and,
    based on that, we determine which word is lexicographically
    smaller. If word <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is
    the beginning of the word <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, then word <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is lexicographically smaller than
    word <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>.</p>
<p>Mirko is currently not in the mood for encrypting, so he
    kindly asks you to do it for him.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 100$</span>). Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains a single word that
    consists of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>
    lowercase letters of the English alphabet. The words will be
    mutually distinct. The last line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers – the elements of array
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>In the case when a solution doesn’t exist, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">NE</tt>”. Otherwise, output “<tt class="ttfamily">DA</tt>” in the first line, and in the second line
    output a word consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span> different letters of the English
    alphabet – the key for the substitution cipher. If multiple
    solutions exist, output any.</p>
