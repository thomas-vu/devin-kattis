<p>Open-pit mining is a surface mining technique of extracting
    rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open
    pit or borrow. Open-pit mines are used when deposits of
    commercially useful minerals or rocks are found near the
    surface. Automatic Computer Mining (ACM) is a company that
    would like to maximize its profits by open-pit mining. ACM has
    hired you to write a program that will determine the maximum
    profit it can achieve given the description of a piece of
    land.</p>
<p>Each piece of land is modelled as a set of blocks of
    material. Block <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> has an
    associated value (<span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span>),
    as well as a cost (<span class="tex2jax_process">$c_
    i$</span>), to dig that block from the land. Some blocks
    obstruct or bury other blocks. So for example if block
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is obstructed by
    blocks <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, then one must first
    dig up blocks <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> before block
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> can be dug up. A block
    can be dug up when it has no other blocks obstructing it.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input is an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 200$</span>) which is the number of blocks. These
    blocks are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    through <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    describing these blocks. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th such line describes block
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and starts with two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span> denoting the value
    and cost of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th
    block (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq v_ i, c_ i \leq
    200$</span>).</p>
<p>Then a third integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq
    m_ i \leq N-1$</span> on this line describes the number of
    blocks that block <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    obstructs. Following that are <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_
    i$</span> distinct space separated integers between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (but excluding <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>) denoting the label(s) of the
    blocks that block <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    obstructs.</p>
<p>You may assume that it is possible to dig up every block for
    some digging order. The sum of values <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_ i$</span> over all blocks <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> will be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer giving the maximum profit that ACM
    can achieve from the given piece of land.</p>
