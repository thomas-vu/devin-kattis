<div class="problembody">
<p>A large number of helium balloons have been set up as part
    of a carnival game. Players shoot a pellet gun into the
    balloons and earn a point for every balloon they pop. Each
    balloon is spherical and is tied to a string at the bottom.
    Each string is taped to a table top at a particular location.
    Gunshots are described by giving a three-dimensional location,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, for the end of the
    barrel and a vector, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>,
    describing the direction the barrel is pointing.</p>

<p>We assume that the pellet is very small and travels in a
    perfectly straight line when fired. It pops any balloon it
    passes through. The strings tied to the balloons are so thin
    that they are never hit by the pellet.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> test cases. Each test case
    begins with an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n
    \le 50$</span>, giving the number of balloons. This is followed
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
    containing four space-separated real numbers: the radius of the
    balloon (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le r \le
    10$</span>), the length of string itâ€™s tied to (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le s \le 10$</span>), and the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> location on the table top where
    the string is taped down (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10
    \le x, y \le 10$</span>).</p>
<p>The balloon descriptions are followed by a line containing
    an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le
    10$</span>. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines each contain a gunshot description, which has six
    space-separated real numbers, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span> location for <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (where <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span> is the height above the table) and
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span> coordinates for <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>. All shot coordinates are in the
    range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-10, 10]$</span>.</p>
<p>You can be assured that the tip of the barrel is not inside
    any balloon and that no balloons intersect. Also, no string
    from one balloon touches any other balloon and the direction
    vector for the gun always has positive length. All real numbers
    have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> digits
    after the decimal point. The end of all test cases is marked by
    a value of zero for <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each shot in a test case, output the number of points
    earned by that shot.</p>
