<div class="problembody">
<p>In her bike rides around Warsaw, Jill happened upon a shop
    that sold interesting glass bottles. She thought it might make
    an interesting project to use such bottles for measuring
    liquids, but this would require placing markings on the bottles
    to indicate various volumes. Where should those volume marks be
    placed?</p>
<p>Jill formalized the problem as follows. Assume a bottle is
    formed by revolving a shape that is the same as the graph of a
    polynomial <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = x_{\text {low}}$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = x_{\text {high}}$</span>
    around the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis. Thus
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis is coincident
    with a vertical line through the center of the bottle. The
    bottom of the bottle is formed by a solid circular region at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = x_{\text {low}}$</span>, and
    the top of the bottle, at <span class="tex2jax_process">$x =
    x_{\text {high}}$</span>, is left open.</p>
<p>The first sample input represents a bottle formed using the
    simple polynomial <span class="tex2jax_process">$4 -
    0.25x$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{\text
    {low}}= 0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{\text
    {high}}= 12$</span>. The bottom of this bottle is a circle with
    a radius of <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, and the
    opening at the top is a circle with a radius of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. The height of this bottle is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>. Volume markings are
    in increments of <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span>.</p>
<p>Given a polynomial <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{\text {low}}$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{\text {high}}$</span>, and
    the volume increment between successive marks on the bottle,
    compute the distances up from <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{\text {low}}$</span> for the marks at
    successive volume increments. A mark cannot be made past the
    top of the bottle, and no more than the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> increments should be marked.
    Assume the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is
    greater than zero everywhere between <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{\text {low}}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{\text {high}}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each test case consists of three lines of bottle data:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Line 1: <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the
        degree of the polynomial (an integer satisfying
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n \le 10$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Line 2: <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_0$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ n$</span>, the real coefficients of
        the polynomial <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>
        defining the bottle’s shape, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_0$</span> is the constant term,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1$</span> is the
        coefficient of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x^1$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span>, and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ n$</span> is the
        coefficient of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x^ n$</span>.
        For each <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$-100 \le a_ i \le
        100$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ n \ne
        0$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Line 3:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{\text
            {low}}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{\text {high}}$</span>, the real
            valued boundaries of the bottle (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-100 \le x_{\text {low}} &lt;
            x_{\text {high}} \le 100$</span> and <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{\text {high}}- x_{\text {low}}
            &gt; 0.1$</span></span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$inc$</span>, an
            integer which is the volume increment before each
            successive mark on the bottle (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le inc \le 500$</span>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, display the case number and the volume
    of the full bottle on one line. On a second line, display the
    increasing sequence of no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> successive distances up from the
    bottom of the bottle for the volume markings. All volumes and
    height marks should be given with exactly two decimal places.
    If the bottle does not have a volume that allows at least one
    mark, display the phrase <tt class="ttfamily">insufficient volume</tt>. No test case will
    result in a mark within <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.01$</span> from the top of the bottle. The
    volume of the bottle will not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>. All rounded distances for
    marks on a bottle differ by at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.05$</span>.</p>
