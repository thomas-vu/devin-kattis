<p>Alex and Steve just got back home from a mining trip and now
    have a lot of extra cobblestone. With their house already
    built, they decide to play a game of subtraction. They take
    turns subtracting from an initial stack of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> cobblestone. At a turn
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, the player can
    subtract any amount of cobblestone from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. For example, the first player who
    goes must subtract exactly 1 cobblestone and the second player
    can either subtract 1 or 2 cobblestone. The player who cannot
    subtract anything loses. Alex always goes first. Will Alex win
    if she plays optimally?<br/></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 5\, 000$</span>, the initial
    cobblestone stack size.<br/></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “YES” if Alex will win, “NO” if otherwise.<br/></p>
