<div class="problembody">
<p>Most of you have played card games (and if you haven’t, why
    not???) in which the deck of cards is randomized by shuffling
    it one or more times.</p>
<p>A <em>perfect shuffle </em> is a type of shuffle where the
    initial deck is divided exactly in half, and the two halves are
    perfectly interleaved. For example, a deck consisting of eight
    cards ABCDEFGH (where A is the top card of the deck) would be
    divided into two halves ABCD and EFGH and then interleaved to
    get AEBFCGDH. Note that in this shuffle the original top card
    (A) stays on top — this type of perfect shuffle is called an
    <em>out-shuffle</em>. An equally valid perfect shuffle would
    start with the first card from the second half and result in
    EAFBGCHD — this is known as an <em>in-shuffle</em>.</p>
<p>While normal shuffling does a good job at randomizing a
    deck, perfect shuffles result in only a small number of
    possible orderings. For example, if we perform multiple
    out-shuffles on the deck above, we obtain the following:</p>
<center>
      ABCDEFGH <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span>
      AEBFCGDH <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span>
      ACEGBDFH <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span>
      ABCDEFGH <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow \cdots
      $</span>
</center>
<p>So after 3 out-shuffles, the deck is returned to its
    original state. A similar thing happens if we perform multiple
    in-shuffles on an 8-card deck, though in this case it would
    take 6 shuffles before we get back to where we started. With a
    standard 52 card deck, only 8 out-shuffles are needed before
    the deck is returned to its original order (talented magicians
    can make use of this result in many of their tricks). These
    shuffles can also be used on decks with an odd number of cards,
    but we have to be a little careful: for out-shuffles, the first
    half of the deck must have 1 more card than the second half;
    for in-shuffles, it’s the exact opposite. For example, an
    out-shuffle on the deck ABCDE results in ADBEC, while an
    in-shuffle results in CADBE.</p>
<p>For this problem you will be given the size of a deck and
    must determine how many in- or out-shuffles it takes to return
    the deck to its pre-shuffled order.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one line containing a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \leq 1000$</span> (the size of
    the deck) followed by either the word <tt class="tt">in</tt> or
    <tt class="tt">out</tt>, indicating whether you should perform
    in-shuffles or out-shuffles.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the case number followed by the
    number of in- or out-shuffles required to return the deck to
    its original order.</p>
