<div class="problembody">
<p>Truls and Henry are playing table tennis against each
    other.</p>
<p>Both Truls and Henry strongly dislike math. More than
    anything, they hate calculating how many points each of them
    has during the game. To simplify scoring, they have come up
    with their own solution:</p>
<p>Instead of constantly keeping track of their points, they
    write a “<tt class="ttfamily">T</tt>” if Truls scores a point
    and an “<tt class="ttfamily">H</tt>” if Henry scores a point,
    immediately after each won rally.</p>
<p>When Truls and Henry play table tennis, the scoring system
    works according to these three rules:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>One point is awarded after each rally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A player wins a match if both of the following
        conditions are met:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The player leads by at least 2 points over their
            opponent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The player has at least 11 points.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if Truls has 11 points and Henry has 9
        points, Truls is declared the winner. But if Truls has 11
        points and Henry has 10 points, there is no winner yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a player wins according to the criteria above, the
        points for both players are reset to zero, and a new match
        begins.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now Truls and Henry have been playing for a long time, and
    both want to know the current score. They ask you to write a
    program that calculates the current score for them based on
    their notes.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of Truls and Henry’s notes, which consists of
    multiple letters on a single line. The number of letters is
    between 1 and 30. Each letter will be either “<tt class="ttfamily">T</tt>” or “<tt class="ttfamily">H</tt>”.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the score of the ongoing match as <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>-<span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> is the number of points Truls has,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> is the number of
    points Henry has.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each
    worth a number of points. Each test group contains a set of
    test cases. To get the points for a test group you need to
    solve all test cases in the test group.</p>

<h2>Explanation of Sample 1</h2>
<p>In total, Truls has won 4 points, and Henry has won 5
    points.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample 2</h2>
<p>Since Truls won the match when the score reached <tt class="ttfamily">11-0</tt>, the score was reset to <tt class="ttfamily">0-0</tt>.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample 3</h2>
<p>Even though both have more than 11 points, neither leads by
    2 points. Therefore, no winner has been declared yet.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample 4</h2>
<p>This game is a continuation of sample 3, where Henry wins
    the match after scoring two more points. The score is reset,
    and Henry then wins another point. Therefore, the score is
    <tt class="ttfamily">0-1</tt>.</p>
