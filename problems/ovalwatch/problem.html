<div class="problembody">
<p>It’s the year 2020 and OvalWatch is the most popular massive
    online first person shooter game.</p>
<p>OvalWatch features a set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> characters, and during a match,
    each player can choose one of these characters to play.</p>
<p>In order to keep each match interesting, for every match,
    OvalWatch requires that all players select unique characters
    and that all characters are selected (there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> players in each match).</p>
<p>This requirement however is problematic because sometimes
    multiple players might want to play the same character. For
    example, suppose player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> wants to pick “TraySir”, and they
    tell everyone “I wanna be TraySir”, but player <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> might have already picked
    “TraySir” and replies “I’m already TraySir”, leaving player
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> disappointed and
    frustrated.</p>
<p>Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> might then
    attempt to pick another character, say, “WindowMaker”, and they
    ask “What about WindowMaker?”. Unfortunately, another player
    may have picked WindowMaker in this time and replies “I’m
    already WindowMaker.”, leaving Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> no choice but to pick yet someone
    else.</p>
<p>BeeLizard, the developer of OvalWatch, wants to eliminate
    the frustrating player experience of having to pick a character
    many times just to find one that’s available, and came up with
    an ingenious algorithm to do so.</p>
<p>Announcing BeeLizard’s OvalWatch’s newest feature: Ghost
    Leg.</p>
<p>In Ghost Leg, the players are are enumerated horizontally
    across the top of the page, while the in game characters are
    enumerated horizontally across the bottom of the page. Vertical
    lines are drawn connecting each person with the character
    directly below.</p>
<p>Next, “legs” are added to the page. Each leg is a horizontal
    line connecting two adjacent vertical lines, and must not touch
    any other leg.</p>
<p>Finally, each player <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> traces a continuous path from
    themselves to a character at the bottom. If player <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> encounters a leg while tracing the
    path, they must follow the leg across to the other vertical
    line, and resume tracing downwards. The character at the end of
    their path is the character assigned to player <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>.</p>
<p>As BeeLizard’s intern, you have to implement the GhostLeg
    feature of OvalWatch.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of players, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, the number of legs.
    It is guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq
    N\leq 5\, 000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq
    K\leq 100\, 000$</span>.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> lines of
    the input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i, B_ i$</span> describing each leg.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> denotes the index
    of vertical line on the left side of the leg. Note that
    vertical lines are indexed from left to right starting from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span> denotes the distance between
    the top of the board and the leg’s position at the left
    vertical line. It is guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq A_ i&lt;N-1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq B_ i\leq 10^9$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers, where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$V_ i$</span> denotes that character
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$V_ i$</span> is assigned to
    player <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
