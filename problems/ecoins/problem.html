<div class="problembody">
<p>At the Department for Bills and Coins, an extension of
    today’s monetary system has newly been proposed, in order to
    make it fit the new economy better. A number of new so called
    e-coins will be produced, which, in addition to having a value
    in the normal sense of today, also have an InfoTechnological
    value. The goal of this reform is, of course, to make justice
    to the economy of numerous dotcom companies which, despite the
    fact that they are low on money surely have a lot of IT inside.
    All money of the old kind will keep its conventional value and
    get zero InfoTechnological value.</p>
<p>To successfully make value comparisions in the new system,
    something called the e-modulus is introduced. This is
    calculated as <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sqrt {X^2 +
    Y^2}$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> hold the sums of
    the conventional and InfoTechnological values respectively. For
    instance, money with a conventional value of $3 altogether and
    an InfoTechnological value of $4 will get an e-modulus of $5.
    Bear in mind that you have to calculate the sums of the
    conventional and InfoTechnological values separately before you
    calculate the e-modulus of the money.</p>
<p>To simplify the move to e-currency, you are assigned to
    write a program that, given the e-modulus that shall be reached
    and a list of the different types of e-coins that are
    available, calculates the smallest amount of e-coins that are
    needed to exactly match the e-modulus. There is no limit on how
    many e-coins of each type that may be used to match the given
    e-modulus.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: The illustration exemplifies adding 8
          coins of conventional value 2 and InfoTechnological value
          1, and 2 coins with pure InfoTechnological value 2. The
          e-modulus is of course 20 since <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sqrt {(8 \cdot 2+ 2 \cdot 0)^2+(8
          \cdot 1+2 \cdot 2)^2}= \sqrt {16^2+12^2}=20$</span>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>A line with the number of problems <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0&lt;n\le 100$</span>), followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> times:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>A line with the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0&lt;m\le 40$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0&lt; S \le 300$</span>), where
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> indicates the
        number of different e-coin types that exist in the problem,
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> states the
        value of the e-modulus that shall be matched exactly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each
        consisting of one pair of non-negative integers describing
        the value of an e-coin. The first number in the pair states
        the conventional value, and the second number holds the
        InfoTechnological value of the coin. Both values are
        between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> (inclusive).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When more than one number are present on a line, they will
    be separated by a space. Between each problem, there will be
    one blank line.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines. Each line contains either a
    single integer holding the number of coins necessary to reach
    the specified e-modulus <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> or, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> cannot be reached, the string
    “<tt class="ttfamily">not possible</tt>”.</p>
