</div>Just about any product found in a grocery store has a
    “best before” date printed on it. Unfortunately, the format for
    these dates can vary quite a bit: what is it supposed to mean
    that the bread you bought yesterday is “best before 12/11/10”?
    It could mean that the bread expires on November 10, 2012 (now
    that’s a suspiciously durable bread and probably it is not
    healthy for you for other reasons!), or it could mean that the
    bread expired on December 11, 2010 (d’oh!), or a variety of
    other options. To be safe, the truly paranoid (or healthily
    skeptic, depending on who you ask) person would assume that it
    means “best before November 12, 2010”, since that is the
    earliest possible date. On the other hand, seeing “31/5/2012”
    even the truly paranoid person knows that this must mean May
    31, 2012 since that is the only possible real date using these
    three numbers.

    <p>Given a possibly ambiguous date “<span class="tex2jax_process">$A/B/C$</span>”, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$A, B, C$</span> are integers between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2999$</span>, output the earliest possible
    legal date between Jan 1, 2000 and Dec 31, 2999 (inclusive)
    using them as day, month and year (but not necessarily in that
    order).</p>
<p>Recall that a year is a leap year (has 366 days) if the year
    is divisible by 4, unless it is divisible also by 100 but not
    by 400 (so 2000 is a leap year, 2100 is not a leap year, and
    2012 is a leap year).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input file consists of a single line containing three
    integers separated by “/”. There are no extra spaces around the
    “/”. Years may be truncated to two digits and may in that case
    also omit the leading <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    (if there is one), so <span class="tex2jax_process">$2000$</span> could be given as “2000”, “00”
    or “0” (but not as an empty string). Months and days may be
    zero-padded. You may assume that the year, when given with four
    digits, is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$2000$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2999$</span>. At most one of
    the integers has four digits, and the others have one or two
    digits.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line giving the earliest legal date possible
    given the above constraints. The output should be formatted as
    year-month-day, where year has four digits, and month and day
    have two digits each (zero padding), for example “<tt class="ttfamily">2011-07-15</tt>”.</p>
<p>If there is no legal date (subject to the above constraints)
    then output a single line with the original string followed by
    the words “<tt class="ttfamily">is illegal</tt>”.</p>
