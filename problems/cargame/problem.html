</div>Traveling by car can sometimes be very boring. The
    natural cure for this boredom is to play a word game. In the
    following example the winner is he or she who has won the most
    rounds when the car stops. Each round starts with someone
    reading out loud the three letters on the license plate of an
    oncoming car. Whoever is first to say a word containing those
    letters in the same order wins the round. On the last road trip
    you failed miserably in this game, but this time you will be
    more prepared.

    <h2>Task</h2>
<p>For each set of three letters find the first word in a
    dictionary that contains these letters in the same order.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \leq 5\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M \leq 10\, 000$</span>, the
    number of words in the dictionary and the number of license
    plates to be handled. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains a word from the
    dictionary, a string no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters long containing only
    lower case letters from the English alphabet. This is followed
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines each
    containing a string of three uppercase letters from the English
    alphabet, representing a license plate.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each license plate in the input you should output one
    line containing either the first valid word in the dictionary
    or the sentence “<tt>No valid word</tt>” if no such word
    exists.</p>
