<p>One of our older Mars Rovers has nearly completed its tour
    of duty and is awaiting instructions for one last mission to
    explore the Martian surface. The survey team has picked a route
    and has entrusted you with the job of transmitting the final
    set of instructions to the rover. This route is simply a
    sequence of moves in the cardinal directions: North, South,
    East, and West. These instructions can be sent using a string
    of corresponding characters: <tt class="tt">N, S, E</tt>, and
    <tt class="tt">W</tt>. However, receiving the signal drains the
    rover’s power supply, which is already dangerously low.
    Fortunately, the rover’s creators built in the ability for you
    to optionally define a single “macro” that can be used if the
    route has a lot of repetition. More concretely, to send a
    message with a macro, two strings are sent. The first is over
    the characters {<tt class="tt">N,S,E,W,M</tt>} and the second
    is over {<tt class="tt">N,S,E,W</tt>}. The first string
    represents a sequence of moves and calls to a macro (<tt class="tt">M</tt>), while the second string determines what the macro
    expands out to. For example:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<tt class="tt">WNMWMME<br/>
      EEN</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>is an encoding of</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<tt class="tt">WNEENWEENEENE</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>Notice that the version with macros requires only
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> characters, whereas
    the original requires <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span>.</p>
<p>Given a route, determine the minimum number of characters
    needed to transmit it to the rover.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single line containing a non-empty
    string made up of the letters <tt class="tt">N, S, E</tt>, and
    <tt class="tt">W</tt> representing the route to transmit to the
    rover. The maximum length of the string is <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the minimum number of characters needed to encode
    the route.</p>
