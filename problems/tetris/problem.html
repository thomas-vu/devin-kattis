<p>Tetris is a popular computer game played in a field
    consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> columns
    and an unlimited number of rows. In one move, one of the
    following seven pieces is dropped into the field:</p>

</center>
<p>When dropping a piece, the player is free to rotate the
    piece <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$180$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$270$</span> degrees and to move it left or
    right, as long as the piece stays entirely in the field. The
    piece then falls until it settles on the bottom of the field or
    on already occupied squares. In our variant of Tetris the piece
    <b class="bfseries">must</b> fall so that <b class="bfseries">all parts</b> of the piece are on the bottom of the
    field or on already occupied squares. In other words, after the
    piece has fallen there may not be <b class="bfseries">a free
    square</b> such that <b class="bfseries">some square above it
    is occupied</b>.</p>
<p>For example, let the field be six columns wide with initial
    heights (the number of already occupied squares in each column)
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Piece number <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> can then be dropped into the field
    in five different ways:</p>

<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth ]{tetris2}" src="/problems/tetris/file/statement/en/img-0002.png" style="width:95.00%"/>
</center>
<p>You are given the initial heights of all columns and the
    figure to be dropped into the field.</p>
<p>Write a program that calculates the number of different ways
    to do this, i.e., the number of different field configurations
    that can be achieved by dropping the piece.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le C \le 100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P
    \le 7$</span>, the number of columns and the number of the
    piece to be dropped.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> integers separated by single
    spaces, each between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, inclusive.
    These are the initial heights of the columns.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output on a single line the number of different ways to drop
    the piece in the field.</p>
