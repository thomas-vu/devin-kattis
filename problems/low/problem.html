<div class="problembody">
<p>You are building advanced chips for machines. Making the
    chips is easy, but the power supply turns out to be an issue
    since the available batteries have varied power outputs.</p>
<p>Consider the problem of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> machines, each with two chips,
    where each chip is powered by <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> batteries. Surprisingly, it does
    not matter how much power each chip gets, but a machine works
    best when its two chips have power outputs as close as
    possible. The power output of a chip is simply the smallest
    power output of its <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    batteries.</p>
<p>You have a stockpile of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2nk$</span> batteries that you want to
    assign to the chips. It might not be possible to allocate the
    batteries so that in every machine both chips have equal power
    outputs, but you want to allocate them so that the differences
    are as small as possible. To be precise, you want to tell your
    customers that in all machines the difference of power outputs
    of the two chips is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, and you want to make <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> as small as possible. To do this
    you must determine an optimal allocation of the batteries to
    the machines.</p>
<p>Consider Sample Input 1. There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> machines, each requiring
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> batteries per chip,
    and a supply of batteries with power outputs <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
    12$</span>. You can, for instance, assign the batteries with
    power outputs <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 3, 5$</span> to
    one chip, those with power <span class="tex2jax_process">$2, 4,
    12$</span> to the other chip of the same machine, those with
    power <span class="tex2jax_process">$6, 8, 9$</span> to the
    third chip, and those with power <span class="tex2jax_process">$7, 10, 11$</span> to the fourth. The power
    outputs of the chips are <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2,
    6$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>,
    respectively, and the difference between power outputs is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> in both machines. Note
    that there are many other ways to achieve this result.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. A test case
    consists of two lines. The first line contains two positive
    integers: the number of machines <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and the number of batteries per
    chip <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2nk \leq 10^6$</span>). The second line
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$2nk$</span> integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> specifying the
    power outputs of the batteries (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p_ i \leq 10^9$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the smallest number <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> such that you can allocate the
    batteries so that the difference of power outputs of the two
    chips in each machine is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>.</p>
