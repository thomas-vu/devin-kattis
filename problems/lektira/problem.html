<p>Mario is making up silly games again instead of reading
    Dostoevsky for school. The rules of his newest game follow.
    First he chooses a random word from the book. Then he splits
    the word in two arbitrary places to get three separate words.
    After that he reverses the order of the letters in each of
    those three words (exchanges the first and last letters, the
    second and second last and so on).</p>
<p>Finally, he puts the three words back together in the same
    order in which they were before splitting. The goal of the game
    is to obtain the lexicographically smallest word possible. In
    other words, of all words that can be obtained by the above
    procedure, find one which would be earliest in a
    dictionary.</p>
<p>Write a program that plays Mario’s game perfectly.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains Mario’s chosen
    word, a string of lowercase letters of the English alphabet
    with no spaces.</p>
<p>The input word will be between <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> characters long (inclusive).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the best word on a single line.</p>
