<p>The other day Bjarki was playing one of his many video
    games, <em><span class="tex2jax_process">$\sim $</span>s</em>.
    In <em><span class="tex2jax_process">$\sim $</span>s</em> you
    build a house, start a family, and slowly, but surely, gain
    riches and fame. One particular day in the game there was a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> year anniversary
    party and Bjarki’s characters invited all their friends.</p>
<p>During the party people started chatting. Due to the way
    <em><span class="tex2jax_process">$\sim $</span>s</em> is
    programmed once people start chatting they can’t stop. So as
    time goes on people get added to conversations but they never
    leave them. Steadily, groups of people chatting start to form
    and a person from one group can’t join another without the
    groups merging.</p>
<p>Bjarki is starting to get bored watching this process so he
    starts counting the size of the groups. But every person is so
    small on the screen it’s actually easier for him to notice the
    speechbubble form, which indicate a merger of groups. Bjarki
    gives you two different types of queries. One indicates a
    speechbubble and the other means Bjarki wants to know the size
    of a particular group chat.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n, q \leq 10^6$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> denoting the total
    amount of guests at the party and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> denoting the amount of queries.
    Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines follow, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th of which contains
    either contains ‘t’ and two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a, b \leq n$</span> or ‘s’ and one
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a \leq n$</span>.
    If the line begins with ‘t’ it indicates that the groups guest
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and guest <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> belong to merge and if the line
    begins with ‘s’ you should print the size of the group guest
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> belongs to.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should contain one line containing one integer
    for each query of the ‘s’ type indicating the size of the
    specified group.</p>
