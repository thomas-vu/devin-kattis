</div>In his free time, when he’s not busy hacking computers,
    Dr. Back runs a zoo. Every morning he gets up and makes sure
    that none of the animals have escaped. He has a huge list of
    all the animals and checks each animal off as he sees it, but
    thinks this is really inefficient. He only cares about what
    animal they are, since all similar animals share a cage. So, if
    he has a white tiger and a siberian tiger, Dr. Back only wants
    to know that he has <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    tigers.

    <p>Given an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines describing
    animals, output in alphabetical order the animals Dr. Back has
    in his zoo, followed by their count.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will contain multiple test cases, up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>. Each test case
    contains a line containing a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le n \le 10^{3}$</span>), followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines of animals with at least one
    word on every line. An animal name may consist of multiple
    lowercase or uppercase words, with the last one describing the
    kind of animal. Animal names may contain apostrophes, hyphens,
    and periods; e.g., <em>St. Vincent’s Agouti</em> would be a
    valid animal name. The input is terminated when <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the list number, followed by the
    animals Dr. Back has in his zoo in lowercase and alphabetical
    order, with each animal followed by one space and the delimiter
    | and then another space and their count.</p>
