</div>Somewhere in a mountainous region of the world is a
    collection of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    villages. Connecting these villages to one another is a series
    of roads, always running directly between two villages and
    allowing travel in both directions. Due to the treacherous
    landscape, building these roads is expensive, so the minimum
    number of roads have been constructed such that each village
    can reach every other village via a sequence of roads.

    <p>Trade between these villages is very important, since not
    every village has access to the same supply of natural
    resources. Many villages produce the same resource, however, so
    it is useful for villages to know their relative distance to
    other villages so that they can choose trading partners to
    minimize overall trading costs. Note that the distance between
    two villages <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> is the sum of the
    lengths of the individual roads on the shortest path that
    connects <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>.</p>
<p>A project has been underway to compute the distance between
    every pair of villages. This information has been incorporated
    in a table, along with a map that shows the layout of villages
    and roads that run between them. You have been assigned the
    task of distributing the table and map to all the villages for
    the betterment of the regional economy.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, not long after you were given this task, a
    gust of wind blew the map right out of your hand and into the
    countryside. Despite your best efforts of searching for it, you
    have been unable to locate it. You know that you could visit
    all the villages to reconstruct the map and THEN start
    distributing the map and table, but this will take twice as
    long as the original task and the villages will be very
    displeased with you. You wonder, maybe itâ€™s possible to
    reconstruct the map given only the table?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input will contain the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 2\, 500$</span>), the number
    of villages in this region. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines will contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers each. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{\rm th}$</span> integer of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\rm th}$</span> line is the
    distance from village <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    to village <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>. All
    distances are greater than zero unless <span class="tex2jax_process">$i = j$</span>, less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^7$</span>, and it is guaranteed that the
    distance from village <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    to village <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> is the same
    as the distance from village <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> to village <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> lines with two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> on each line, indicating that
    there is a road connecting villages <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> in this region. Assume the
    villages are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Any solution that outputs the
    original set of roads will be accepted.</p>
