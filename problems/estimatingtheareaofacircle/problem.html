<p>One way to estimate the area of a circle is to draw a square
    that just encompasses the circle and mark points randomly (with
    uniform probability) with a marker. Then, when you get tired of
    marking points, count up the number of points that you marked
    that landed in the circle and divide it by the total number of
    points that you marked. That gives you an idea of how large the
    circle is relative to the square. Your job is to judge how
    accurate this is for given circles and experiment outcomes.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\,
    000$</span> test cases, one test case per line. Each line has
    three space-separated numbers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$r\ m\ c$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; r \le 1\, 000$</span> is a real
    number with at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>
    digits past the decimal indicating the true radius of the
    circle, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le 100\,
    000$</span> is an integer indicating the total number of marked
    points, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le c \le
    m$</span> is an integer indicating the number of marked points
    that fall in the circle. Input ends with a line containing
    three zeros, which should not be processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print a line containing two numbers: the
    true area of the circle and the estimate according to the
    experiment. Both numbers may have a relative error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span>.</p>
