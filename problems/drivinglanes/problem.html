<p>While driving around a curve on the highway, Sam realizes
    that if they use the inside lane, they travel a shorter
    distance. Sam wonders what is the minimum distance needed to
    travel to the destination.</p>
<p>The multilane highway consists of a sequence of
    straightaways that are connected by curves. When going around a
    curve, the distance travelled depends on which lane you are in.
    Each curve has a curvature <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> and stretch <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>. Specifically, if Sam is in lane
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, then they travel
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s + c \cdot i$</span> meters
    while going around this curve.</p>
<p>Whenever Sam is on a straightaway, they may change from one
    lane into an adjacent lane. When changing to an adjacent lane,
    Sam moves forward <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    meters, but travels a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k+r$</span> meters. Each lane change must be
    completed before the car reaches the end of the current
    straightaway. Sam may change lanes multiple times in the same
    straightaway. For safety reasons, changing lanes is not
    possible on curves.</p>

<p>Sam starts in lane <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    and wishes to end in lane <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. What is the minimum distance they
    must travel?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 250$</span>), which is the
    number of straightaways, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 250$</span>), which is the
    number of lanes on the highway. The lanes are numbered
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \dots , m$</span>.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq 10^6$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq r \leq 10^6$</span>), which are the
    lane changing parameters.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    describe the straightaways in order. Each of these lines
    contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell
    $</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq \ell \leq
    10^6$</span>), which is the length of this straightaway.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> lines
    describe the curves in order. Each of these lines contains two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s \leq 10^6$</span>), which is the
    stretch of this curve, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^6 \leq c \leq 10^6$</span>), which is
    the curvature of this curve. It is guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$s + c \cdot m &gt; 0$</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th curve
    connects the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i+1)$</span>th
    straightaway.</p>
