<p>You won a small handheld fan at an office party.
    Unfortunately, the battery is not replaceable – it is fused to
    the circuitry and is not rechargeable. The company wants you to
    buy a new fan when the charge is depleted (Canada is really far
    behind with right-to-repair legislation). The fan’s battery can
    operate for exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>
    hours with its initial charge.</p>
<p>You want to attend an outdoor festival taking place over the
    Summer and will take your fan to stay cool during the festival.
    The festival does not permit reentry and only allows people to
    enter or leave at start of each hour, so your time spent there
    will be in the form of a sequence of consecutive hours. You
    also know the hourly forecast for the next few days during the
    Folksy Music Festival. For an hour with a forecasted
    temperature of <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> degrees
    Celsius, you will operate the fan exactly a <span class="tex2jax_process">$T/30$</span>-fraction of the time during
    that hour (i.e. <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \cdot
    T$</span> minutes during the hour).</p>
<p>You decide that you will only attend the festival during a
    sequence of consecutive hours if at the start of each hour your
    fan’s initial charge at that hour guarantees it can operate for
    a <span class="tex2jax_process">$T/30$</span>-fraction of the
    time during that hour. What is the longest period of time you
    can attend the festival?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 1,000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq W \leq 1,000$</span>). The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1, t_2, \ldots , t_n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq t_i \leq 30$</span>) where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_i$</span> is the forecasted
    temperature for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th
    hour of the festival.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> indicating the maximum number of
    consecutive hours you are able to attend the festival if you
    pick the first hour optimally, assuming the hourly temperature
    forecast is correct.</p>
