        A well-organised rack of weights.
      </div>
</div>
<p>The city of Bath is a noted olympic training ground—bringing
    local, national, and even international teams to practice.
    However, even the finest gymnasium falls victim to the cardinal
    sin…Weights put back in the wrong spots.</p>
<p>All of the pairs of dumbbells sit in no particular order on
    the two racks, possibly even with some of them split between
    rows. Initially each row has an equal number of dumbbells,
    however, this being a well-funded professional gym, there is
    infinite space at either end of each to hold any additional
    weights.</p>
<p>To move a dumbbell, you may either roll it to a free
    neighbouring space on the same row with almost no effort, or
    you may pick up and lift it to another free spot; this takes
    strength proportional to its weight. For each pair of
    dumbbells, both have the same unique weight.</p>
<p>What is the heaviest of the weights that you need to be able
    to lift in order to put identical weights next to each other?
    Note that you may end up with different numbers of weights on
    each row after rearranging; this is fine.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line containing the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 10^6$</span>), the number of
        pairs;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two lines, each containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_1 \ldots w_ n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le w_ i \le 10^9$</span> for each
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>), where
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_ i$</span> is the mass of
        the weight <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th from
        the left along this row.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every weight in the input appears exactly twice.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the weight of the heaviest dumbbell that must be
    moved, in order that all items can be paired up while lifting
    the smallest possible maximum weight.</p>
