<div class="problembody">
<p>You recently missed an eclipse and are waiting for the next
    one! To see any eclipse from your home, the sun and the moon
    must be in alignment at specific positions. You know how many
    years ago the sun was in the right position, and how many years
    it takes for it to get back to that position. You know the same
    for the moon. When will you see the next eclipse?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two lines.</p>
<p>The first line contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ s$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ s$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0 \le d_ s &lt; y_ s \le 50)$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ s$</span> is how many years
    ago the sun was in the right position, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ s$</span> is how many years it takes for
    the sun to be back in that position.</p>
<p>The second line contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ m$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0 \le d_ m &lt; y_ m \le 50)$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ m$</span> is how many years
    ago the moon was in the right position, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ m$</span> is how many years it takes for
    the moon to be back in that position.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the number of years until the next
    eclipse. The data will be set in such a way that there is not
    an eclipse happening right now and there will be an eclipse
    within the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$5\, 000$</span>
    years.</p>
