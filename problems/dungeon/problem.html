<div class="problembody">
<p>You are trapped in a 3D dungeon and need to find the
    quickest way out! The dungeon is composed of unit cubes which
    may or may not be filled with rock. It takes one minute to move
    one unit north, south, east, west, up or down. You cannot move
    diagonally and the maze is surrounded by solid rock on all
    sides.</p>
<p>Is an escape possible? If yes, how long will it take?</p>
<h2>Input Specification</h2>
<p>The input file consists of a number of dungeons. Each
    dungeon description starts with a line containing three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (all limited to 30 in size).
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> is the number of
    levels making up the dungeon. <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> are the number of rows and columns
    making up the plan of each level.</p>
<p>Then there will follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> blocks of <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> lines each containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> characters. Each character
    describes one cell of the dungeon. A cell full of rock is
    indicated by a ’<tt>#</tt>’ and empty cells are represented by
    a ’<tt>.</tt>’. Your starting position is indicated by
    ’<tt>S</tt>’ and the exit by the letter ’<tt>E</tt>’. There’s a
    single blank line after each level. Input is terminated by
    three zeroes for <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output Specification</h2>
<p>Each maze generates one line of output. If it is possible to
    reach the exit, print a line of the form<br/>
<tt>Escaped in &lt;x&gt; minute(s).</tt><br/>
    where <tt>&lt;x&gt;</tt> is replaced by the shortest time it
    takes to escape. If it is not possible to escape, print the
    line<br/>
<tt>Trapped!</tt></p>
