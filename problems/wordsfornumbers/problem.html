<p>We have two ways of writing out numeric values; we can print
    them in decimal form, like <b class="bfseries">45</b>, or we
    can write them out in text, like <b class="bfseries">forty-five</b>. You are a court reporter who gets
    paid by the character, so you would always prefer to write out
    numbers the long way. To that end, you are going to make sure
    all of your documents have decimal values written out in text
    rather than numbers, even if you have to get a program to help
    you do it.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> lines of text, ending at the end
    of file. All input string tokens are separated by single
    spaces. Each token is either a decimal number or a string of
    alphabet (a–z, A–Z) or simple punctuation characters. Decimal
    numbers in the input are integers in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0,99]$</span>. There are at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> tokens per line, and
    all tokens have a length of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line of text in the input, print out a modified
    version of that line with all occurrences of decimal numbers
    replaced with words. For each decimal number you find, replace
    it with hyphen-separated English words representing the same
    value. Numbers that occur at the start of a line should start
    with an uppercase letter.</p>
