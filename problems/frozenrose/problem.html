<p>The winter is coming and all the experts are warning that it
    will be the coldest one in the last hundred years. Freddy needs
    to make sure that his garden does not sustain any damage. One
    of the most important tasks is to make sure that no water
    remains in his large watering system.</p>
<p>All the water comes from a central node and is distributed
    by pipes to neighboring nodes and so on. Each node is either
    a sprinkler (rose head) with no outgoing pipe or
    an internal node with one or more outgoing pipes leading
    to some other nodes. Every node has exactly one incoming pipe,
    except for the central node which takes the water directly from
    a well and has no incoming pipe. Every pipe has
    a valve that stops all the water going through the pipe.
    The valves are of different quality and age, so some may be
    harder to close than others.</p>
<p>Freddy knows his valves well and has assigned a value
    to each pipe representing the amount of effort needed to close
    the corresponding valve. He asks you to help him count the
    minimum effort needed to close some valves so that no water
    goes to the sprinklers.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains several test cases (at most 100). Each
    test case starts with a line with two integers, the number
    of nodes <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>), and the number
    of the central node <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le c \le n$</span>). Each of
    the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> lines
    represents one pipe and contains three integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le u,v \le n$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le w \le 1\, 000$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> are the nodes connected by a pipe
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> is the effort
    needed to close the valve on that pipe.</p>
<p>You may assume that every node is reachable from the central
    node.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the
    minimum sum of efforts of valves to be closed, such that the
    central node gets separated from all sprinklers.</p>
