</div>Jon Marius forgot how to add two numbers while doing
    research for his PhD. And now he has a long list of addition
    problems that he needs to solve, in addition to his computer
    science ones! Can you help him?
    <p>On his current list Jon Marius has two kinds of problems:
    addition problems on the form “<span class="tex2jax_process">$a
    + b$</span>” and the ever returning problem “P=NP”. Jon Marius
    is a quite distracted person, so he might have to solve this
    last problem several times, since he keeps forgetting the
    solution. Also, he would like to solve these problems by
    himself, so you should skip these.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input will be a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 1\, 000$</span>) denoting the
    number of testcases. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines with either “P=NP” or an
    addition problem on the form “<span class="tex2jax_process">$a+b$</span>”, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a, b \in [0, 1\, 000]$</span> are
    integers.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the result of each addition. For lines containing
    “P=NP”, output “skipped”.</p>
