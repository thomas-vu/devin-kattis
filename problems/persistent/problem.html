<p>The multiplicative persistence of a number is defined by
    Neil Sloane (Neil J.A. Sloane in <em>The Persistence of a
    Number</em> published in Journal of Recreational Mathematics 6,
    1973, pp. 97-98., 1973) as the number of steps to reach a
    one-digit number when repeatedly multiplying the digits. For
    example:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 697 \rightarrow
    378 \rightarrow 168 \rightarrow 48 \rightarrow 32 \rightarrow 6
    \]</span>
<p>That is, the persistence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$697$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>. The persistence of a single digit
    number is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. At the time
    of this writing it is known that there are numbers with the
    persistence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>. It is
    not known whether there are numbers with the persistence of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>, but it is known that
    if they exist then the smallest of them would have more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3000$</span> digits.</p>
<p>The problem that you are to solve here is: what is the
    smallest number such that the first step of computing its
    persistence results in the given number?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of multiple test cases. Each line
    contains a test case, which consists of a decimal number with
    up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> digits.
    The input ends with a line containing <tt class="ttfamily">-1</tt>.</p>
<p>There will be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> test cases in a single input
    file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each testcase, output a single line containing one
    integer number satisfying the condition stated above. If no
    such number exists, output “<tt class="ttfamily">There is no
    such number</tt>”.</p>
