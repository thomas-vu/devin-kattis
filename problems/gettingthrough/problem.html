<div class="problembody">
<p>A long and straight corridor is fitted with a number of
    sensors. Each sensor has a certain range within which it can
    detect objects or persons. If a part of an object is within the
    sensorâ€™s range, an alarm will go off. Otherwise, nothing will
    happen.</p>
<p>Ethan needs to traverse this corridor in order to do some
    spy stuff at the other end. The question is, can he pass
    through the corridor without being detected? Can he fit so
    easily that he can bring some equipment along, or does he have
    to wear some tight clothing? Or can he perhaps send a robot
    through instead?</p>
<p>We model the corridor as being two-dimensional (we ignore
    the height), bounded by two straight lines. Each sensor is
    located inside the corridor or on a wall. Their scopes are well
    in between the two ends of the corridor. We model the person or
    robot going through as a circle. Given the layout, what is the
    maximum radius this circle can have so that it is possible to
    negotiate the corridor without being detected?</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq w \leq 100\, 000$</span>): the
        width of the corridor. The two walls are given by the lines
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x=0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x=w$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span>): the
        number of sensors in the corridor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines with
        three space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x \leq w$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$-100\, 000 \leq y \leq 100\, 000$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq r \leq 100\,
        000$</span>): the location and the range of each sensor,
        respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The two ends of the corridor are at <span class="tex2jax_process">$y=-\infty $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y=+\infty $</span>, or in less technical
    terms, they are far beyond the scope of all the sensors.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with one floating point number: the radius of
        the largest circular object (or person) that could pass
        through the corridor without being detected, assuming the
        object can (be) move(d) with absolute precision. If nothing
        could possibly get through, the output should be zero. The
        number should be accurate up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> absolute precision.</p>
</li>
