<p>You are the RCD for your regional contest. It just ended and
    you now need to decide which teams qualify for the next level
    of competition. The teams are uniquely ranked (there are no
    ties). The next level has a limit on how many teams from any
    given school can participate. However, if that limit causes
    there to be not enough teams advancing, the remaining slots
    will be filled by teams from schools over the limit. If this
    happens, you will always give preference to higher-ranking
    teams, even if it means many teams from the same school
    advancing.</p>
<p>Output, in rank order, the teams that qualify for the next
    contest.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq k &lt; n \leq 10^5$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$ 1
    \leq c \leq n$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of teams in the
    competition, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is the
    number of teams that will advance, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is the limit on the number of
    teams that may advance from any given school.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le t,s \le n$</span>). Each line describes a team, with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> being the team’s
    unique ID, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
    indicating the team’s school. All team IDs will be distinct.
    The teams will be listed in rank order, with the highest
    ranking teams first.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines. On
    each line output a single integer, which is the ID of a team.
    List the IDs of the teams that qualified to advance in rank
    order.</p>
