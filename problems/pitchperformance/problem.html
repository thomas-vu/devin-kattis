<div class="problembody">
<p>After a recent disaster at the Easter party karaoke, you are
    working on improving your singing. To gauge how well you are
    doing, you would like to measure how much the pitch and timing
    of your singing differs from the target melody you were trying
    to perform.</p>
<p>We model the melody in a simplified manner as a
    piecewise-constant function <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>, where at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> the melody has pitch <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(x)$</span>. In other words from time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> up to some time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(x)$</span> is some constant value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1$</span>, and then at time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span> it changes to some
    other value <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_2$</span> and
    remains at that value until some time <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2 &gt; x_1$</span>, and so on.</p>
<p>Your voice, on the other hand, is of a more wavering nature,
    and you may generally not be able to hold an exact constant
    pitch for any period of time, sometimes breaking off into an
    unwelcome falsetto and sometimes croaking on those low tones.
    The pitch of your voice can be modeled in a highly simplistic
    way as a piecewise-quadratic function <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>. In other words from time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span> (not necessarily the same
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span> as for the function
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>), your pitch
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$g(x)$</span> agrees with some
    quadratic polynomial, and then from time <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span> with some other quadratic
    polynomial, and so on.</p>
<p>The difference between your performance <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> and the target melody <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> is the area between these two
    functions. See Figure 1 for an example. Given the melody
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> and your performance
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>, compute their
    difference.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: Illustration of Sample Input 1. The
          difference between <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> is the area of the shaded

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 500$</span>), the number of pieces in the target
    melody function <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>. Then
    follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    describing <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th such line contains
    two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{i-1} &lt; x_ i \le 10^4$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le y_ i \le 10^4$</span>).
    For all <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> in the
    half-open interval <span class="tex2jax_process">$[x_{i-1}, x_
    i)$</span>, the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(x)$</span> equals <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span>. For the first interval we
    define <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_0 = 0$</span>.</p>
<p>Then follows a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le m \le 500$</span>), the number of pieces in the function
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> describing your
    performance. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines contain the description of <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th such line contains four
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x’_ i$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$x’_{i-1} &lt; x’_ i \le 10^4$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^{7} \le a_ i, b_ i, c_ i \le
    10^{7}$</span>). For all <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> in the half-open interval
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[x’_{i-1}, x’_ i)$</span>, the
    value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$g(x)$</span> equals
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ ix^2 + b_ ix + c_ i$</span>.
    For the first interval we define <span class="tex2jax_process">$x’_0 = 0$</span>.</p>
<p>You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le
    g(x) \le 10^4$</span> for all <span class="tex2jax_process">$x’_0 \le x \le x’_ m$</span> and that the
    two functions end at the same time (i.e., <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ n = x’_ m$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the difference between <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>. Your output should be correct to
    within an absolute or relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
