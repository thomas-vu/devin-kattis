<p>When chomping a tree the beaver cuts a very specific shape
    out of the tree trunk. What is left in the tree trunk looks
    like two frustums of a cone joined by a cylinder with the
    diameter the same as its height. A very curious beaver tries
    not to demolish a tree but rather sort out what should be the
    diameter of the cylinder joining the frustums such that he
    chomped out certain amount of wood. You are to help him to do
    the calculations.</p>

<p>We will consider an idealized beaver chomping an idealized
    tree. Let us assume that the tree trunk is a cylinder of
    diameter <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> and that the
    beaver chomps on a segment of the trunk also of height
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>. What should be the
    diameter <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> of the inner
    cylinder such that the beaver chomped out <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> cubic units of wood?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains multiple cases each presented on a separate
    line. Each line contains two space separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D, V$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\leq D\leq 100, 1\leq V\leq 1\, 000\,
    000)$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> is the
    linear units and <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> is in
    cubic units. <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> will not
    exceed the maximum volume of wood that the beaver can chomp. A
    line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$D=0$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$V=0$</span> follows the last
    case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, one line of output should be produced
    containing a floating point number giving the value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> measured in linear
    units. Your output will be considered correct if it is within
    relative or absolute error <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
