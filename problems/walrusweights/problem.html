<div class="problembody">
<p>Wallace the Weightlifting Walrus is training for a contest
    where it will have to lift <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\,
    000$</span> kg. Wallace has some weight plates lying around,
    possibly of different weights, and its goal is to add some of
    the plates to a bar so that it can train with a weight as close
    as possible to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>
    kg.</p>
<p>In case there exist two such numbers which are equally close
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> (e.g.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$998$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 002$</span>), Wallace will pick the
    greater one (in this case <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\,
    002$</span>).</p>
<p>Help Wallace the Weightlifting Walrus and tell it which
    weight it will have to lift.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains the number of plates
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span>). Each of the
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    contains one positive integer less than or equal to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>, denoting the
    weight of each plate.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one integer, the combined weight closest to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>.</p>
