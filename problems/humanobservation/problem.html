<p>It is known by all that the *creepy* <em>Lord Pooty</em>
    loves observing people for <em>“research”</em> purposes. Today,
    he is in a mall and would like to stare at people like usual.
    The mall is modelled as a grid and there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> people, standing at locations
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i, y_ i)$</span> that
    <em>Lord Pooty</em> wants to observe. There are also
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> seats at locations
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i,y_ i)$</span> that
    <em>Lord Pooty</em> can sit at to do his observation. <b class="bfseries">Due to the inherent randomness of the universe that
    none can control, all the locations of people and seats are
    random.</b></p>
<p>He want to choose a seat where the <b class="bfseries">maximum</b> distance<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> from the seat
    to any one person is <b class="bfseries">minimised</b>, to
    allow him better observation. As his fellow <em>research</em>
    buddy, help him find such a seat! If more than one seat is
    optimal, give him the <b class="bfseries">minimum</b>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> pair (i.e.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is minimised, followed
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>)!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 200\, 000$</span>). This is followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines of the following
    form: <span class="tex2jax_process">$x~ y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^9 \leq x,y \leq 10^9$</span>). These are
    the locations of the people. Then, you have an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>. (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq K \leq 200\, 000$</span>). This is
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> lines of
    the following form: <span class="tex2jax_process">$x~ y$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^9 \leq x,y \leq
    10^9$</span>). These are the locations of the seats.</p>
<p><b class="bfseries">All location inputs (people and seats)
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span> are UNIFORMLY,
    INDEPENDENTLY, RANDOMLY GENERATED integers from the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-10^9, 10^9]$</span>. Note that
    it is possible for multiple inputs (seats and people) to be in
    the same location.</b></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, the location of the
    optimal seat. If more than one seat is optimal, print the
    minimum one.</p>
