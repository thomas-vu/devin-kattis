<p>Joe’s landlord has allowed him to paint his room any colour
    that he wants, even multiple colours. Joe has come up with a
    very colourful design. Now he needs to buy the paint. Being a
    struggling student, Joe does not want to waste any money, so he
    has calculated the exact amount that he needs of each colour
    down to the microlitre. To his surprise, however, the local
    paint shop is unwilling to sell him a can of exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3.141592$</span> litres of red
    paint. No, the shop has a set of specific paint can sizes. The
    shop has almost unlimited amount of paint of each color, so
    each can can be filled with whatever colour Joe wishes and the
    shop has unlimited number of cans of each size.</p>
<p>Joe has no choice but to buy a little bit more paint than he
    really needs. Still, he would like to minimize the amount of
    paint wasted. In addition, he does not want to buy more than
    one can of any given colour.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 100\, 000$</span>,
    the number of paint can sizes offered by the paint shop, and
    the number of colours that Joe needs.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains the size of a can offered by the paint shop, in
    microlitres. Each can contains no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> litres.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines contains the number of microlitres that Joe needs of a
    given colour. It is guaranteed that for each colour, the paint
    shop sells a can large enough to satisfy Joe’s needs.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line, the total number of microlitres of
    paint wasted if Joe buys, for each colour, the smallest can
    that satisfies his needs.</p>
