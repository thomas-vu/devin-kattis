<p>A bored technician whose job requires inspecting each of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> equipment stations on
    a regular basis has tried to inject a little variety into his
    days by creating a deck of cards, each card bearing a number in
    the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$1..10$</span>. From
    this deck he randomly deals out <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> cards at the start of the day, and
    uses the numbers on these to determine which stations and in
    what order he will visit them on that day. (He has decided that
    it is OK to visit the same station more than once in the same
    day.)</p>
<p>As time goes by, he adds cards for the number of stations
    where he finds problems, so that he will visit them more often,
    so the number of cards bearing each digit may vary
    considerably.</p>
<p>One day he deals out his cards, and notices that they have
    come out in strictly ascending order. He starts to wonder just
    how likely such an ordering would be.</p>
<p>Find the number of ways to deal the cards that form a
    strictly ascending sequence. (“Strictly ascending” in this
    problem means that, for example <span class="tex2jax_process">$[2, 4, 5]$</span> would be accepted but
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[3, 1, 2]$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[2, 2, 4]$</span> would
    not.)</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> non-negative integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ i$</span>, each denoting the
    number of cards bearing the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. The sum of these <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> numbers is in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\ldots 1\, 000$</span>.</p>
<p>This is followed by a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq K \leq 10$</span>, denoting the
    number of cards to be dealt.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single line containing an integer denoting the
    number of ways to deal <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    cards from that deck that would form a strictly ascending
    sequence.</p>
