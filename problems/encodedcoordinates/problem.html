<div class="problembody">
<p>You have been monitoring a terrorist cell that is planning a
    big attack somewhere close. The terrorists have been sending
    encoded coordinates to each other, and you suspect that the
    attack will happen at one of the locations described by these
    coordinates. You have intercepted the relevant communications
    for a series of locations you want to investigate.</p>
<p>Every location consists of a separate <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinate, each being a
    non-negative integer smaller than some prime number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>. Both coordinates are
    encoded separately using the same process. A source has given
    you information on the process of decoding a single coordinate.
    The input of this process consists of five values: <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<p>Central to the decoding process is a collection of three
    functions, defined in terms of each other and the input value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \begin{array}{lll} F(n+1) &amp; =&amp;
    G(n) + H(n) \\ G(n+1) &amp; =&amp; K*F(n) + H(n-1) \\ H(n+1)
    &amp; =&amp; F(n) + K*G(n) \\ \end{array} \]</span>
<p>The values <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> are used to initialize these
    functions as follows:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    \begin{array}{ccccc} F(1) = A &amp; \qquad &amp; G(1) = B &amp;
    \qquad &amp; H(1) = C \\ \end{array} \]</span>
<p>The decoded coordinate is the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$F(N) \mod P$</span>.</p>
<p>As you might have noticed, there is some crucial information
    missing: you need the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$H(0)$</span> to calculate <span class="tex2jax_process">$G(2)$</span>. While you do not have this
    value, you do know that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinate use the same value for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$H(0)$</span>. Luckily, you have
    managed to already obtain the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> coordinates for the locations.
    Your colleagues have suggested that this does not give you
    enough information to calculate the <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates, but you want to prove
    them wrong.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with the prime number <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq P \leq 19\, 997$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with five space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K_ x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_ x$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq A_ x,B_ x,C_ x,K_ x &lt;
        P$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N_ x
        \leq 10^9$</span>): the parameters for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> coordinate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with five space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K_ y$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_ y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq A_ y,B_ y,C_ y,K_ y &lt;
        P$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N_ y
        \leq 10^9$</span>): the parameters for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x &lt; P$</span>): the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> coordinate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with one integer: the calculated <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinate. If your colleagues
        are right, and there is not exactly one valid <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinate, print
        “<tt>UNKNOWN</tt>” on a single line instead.</p>
</li>
