<p>Fiction books are all the same. The author has decided
    everything in advance, from beginning, middle, to the final
    plot. You, the reader, just read from page 1 to the very
    last page, in that order. So predictable.</p>
<p>A choose-your-own-story fiction book is different. The book
    is divided into sections. Each section starts on a new page. At
    the end of each section, you as the reader gets a choice of how
    you want the story to continue. You get to choose among a set
    of options such as “If you want to enter the dark dungeon, go
    to page 37. If you want to drink the spoiled potion, go to page
    221. If you want to befriend the three-eyed scorpion, go to
    page 114.” In this case, there are three choices, and you
    choose one of these by flipping over to that page. A new
    section starts on that page, and you read that next. You
    continue to do so until, eventually, you reach a section that
    ends the story. A story can end in one of two ways: either
    favourably or catastrophically.</p>

</div>As the true computer scientist you are, you wonder how
    many distinct favourable stories a book contains. You are given
    a choose-your-own-story book, and you want to compute the
    number of times you can read the book, without ever reading the
    exact same story again, and each time ending in a favourable
    way. We will assume that each section that ends with a choice,
    always ends with exactly three choices. We will also assume
    that no story contains a loop; there are no infinite stories.
    You always start your choose-your-own-story on page 1.
    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the number of test
    cases (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq
    100$</span>). The first line of each test case contains an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, the number of
    sections (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq S \leq
    100$</span>).</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>
    lines contains either exactly four integers, or one integer
    plus the word “favourably” or “catastrophically”. All integers
    are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$400$</span>. The first integer
    on each of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> lines is
    the page number on which that section begins. The next three
    integers are the page numbers on which each of the three
    sections start, among which we choose one. The three page
    numbers are distinct, and there is always a section starting on
    those three page numbers. Alternatively, the next word is
    either “favourably” or “catastrophically”, which means the
    story ends here, and in that way. It is guaranteed that some
    section begins on page 1 and no two sections begin on the
    same page number.</p>
<p>All sections listed in the input can be reached starting at
    page <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    test cases, output the number of distinct stories that end in a
    favourable ending. The answer is guaranteed not to exceed a
    signed <span class="tex2jax_process">$64$</span>-bit
    integer.</p>
