<p>Mountain villages like to attract tourists by building
    suspension bridges, such as the one depicted here in the Harz
    Mountains in Germany. These bridges allow
    adventurously-inclined people to seek their thrills by crossing
    over deep gorges. To make sure that everyone gets just the
    right amount of excitement, the sag at the deepest point of the
    bridge should be significant relative to the distance the
    bridge covers.</p>
<p>Given the distance between the anchor points where the
    bridge is attached, and given a desired amount of sag, compute
    how long each of the cables holding the suspension bridge needs
    to be!</p>
<p>To help you solve this task, here is some background: A
    free-hanging suspension bridge will take on the form of a
    catenary curve (<i class="itshape">catena</i> is Latin for
    chain), just like a free-hanging chain between two poles. Given
    the horizontal distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> between two anchor points and the
    desired amount <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> the
    cable is sagging in the center, there exists a positive
    parameter <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> such that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a + s = a \cdot \cosh
    \left(\frac{d}{2 a}\right)$</span>. The length of the cable is
    then given by <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell (a,d) = 2 a
    \cdot \sinh \left(\frac{d}{2 a}\right)$</span>.</p>
<p>The functions <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sinh $</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\cosh $</span> denote the
    hyperbolic sine and hyperbolic cosine, respectively, which are
    defined as follows:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{align*} \sinh x &amp; = \frac{e^ x -
    e^{-x}}{2} &amp; \cosh x &amp; = \frac{e^ x + e^{-x}}{2}
    \end{align*}</span>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case with two
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> given on a single line such that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; d \le 1\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; s \le 1\, 000$</span>.
    The number <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> denotes the
    distance between the anchor points and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is the desired sag at the center
    of the bridge. More precisely, the “sag” here is the vertical
    distance between the cable’s lowest point in the center and the
    horizontal line formed by the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> anchor points on either side of
    the gorge.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the length of cable needed to cover the distance
    between the anchor points to achieve the desired sag. Your
    answer should be correct within an absolute error of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span>.</p>
