<p>Rhymes are complicated. The extent to which one word rhymes
    with another depends on how similar they sound; but if they are
    too similar then they aren’t considered a rhyme at all. Karim
    has a huge list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    words and wants to determine the maximally rhyming pair of
    words. To that end he has introduced the concept of <i class="itshape">rhyme power</i>:</p>
<p>Given two words <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, their rhyme power
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r(S,T)$</span> is defined as</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, if one word is
        a suffix of the other,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the length of their longest common suffix,
        otherwise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For instance, the rhyme power of “fire” and “desire” is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, because their longest
    common suffix “ire” has length <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. In contrast, the rhyme power of
    “impossible” and “possible” is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, because “possible” is a suffix of
    “impossible”.</p>
<p>Given Karim’s list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> words, your task is to find the
    maximum value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$r(S, T)$</span>
    over all pairs of words.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 10^5$</span>, the number of
    words.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    each contain a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_
    i$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq |S_ i|
    \leq 10^6$</span>. The sum of all string lengths <span class="tex2jax_process">$|S_ i|$</span> is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>An integer, the maximal rhyme power.</p>
