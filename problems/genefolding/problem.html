<p>International Cell Processing Company (ICPC) is a world
    leader in the analysis of genetic sequences. A genetic sequence
    is a sequence of nucleotides, which in this problem is
    represented by a string containing only the letters <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">C</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">G</tt>, and <tt class="ttfamily">T</tt> in some
    combination, each letter representing a single nucleotide
    (<b class="bfseries">A</b>denine, <b class="bfseries">C</b>ytosine, <b class="bfseries">G</b>uanine, and
    <b class="bfseries">T</b>hymine, respectively).</p>
<p>One of the key discoveries made by ICPC is that through a
    process called Genetically Optimized Organic Folding (GOOF),
    they can take a genetic sequence and transform it into a
    simpler one, while preserving many of the properties of the
    sequence that ICPC wants to analyze.</p>
<p>A single application of GOOF works as follows. Find a point
    between two adjacent nucleotides in the nucleotide sequence,
    such that the sequence reads the same from that point in both
    directions, up until the nearer end of the sequence. For
    instance, in the sequence <tt class="ttfamily">ATTACC</tt>,
    there are two such points: <tt class="ttfamily">AT-TACC</tt>
    and <tt class="ttfamily">ATTAC-C</tt>. Then pick one of these
    points (say, the first one), and fold the genetic sequence at
    that point, merging the identical nucleotides (so, in this case
    the <tt class="ttfamily">AT</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">TA</tt> would become merged, and the resulting
    sequence would be <tt class="ttfamily">CCAT</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">TACC</tt>).</p>
<p>Through repeated application of GOOF, a nucleotide can
    potentially be made much shorter. However, manually searching
    for the appropriate folding points is very time-consuming. ICPC
    reached out to you to write a program that would automate the
    process of finding the folding points and choosing them so as
    to obtain the shortest possible genetic sequence from a given
    input sequence.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> representing the nucleotide
    sequence to be analyzed. The string consists of characters
    <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">C</tt>,
    <tt class="ttfamily">G</tt>, and <tt class="ttfamily">T</tt>
    only. The length of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4 \cdot 10^6$</span>,
    inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the smallest possible length of a sequence obtained
    from the input by applying GOOF zero or more times.</p>
