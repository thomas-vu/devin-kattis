<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several test cases. Each test case
    starts with a line with two non-negative integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 20\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le m \le 30\, 000$</span>,
    separated by a single space, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the numbers of nodes in the
    graph and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the
    number of edges. Nodes are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each line consisting of
    three (space-separated) integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> indicating that there is an edge
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> in the graph with
    weight <span class="tex2jax_process">$-20\, 000 \le w \le 20\,
    000$</span>. Edges are undirected.</p>
<p>Input will be terminated by a line containing <tt class="ttfamily">0 0</tt>, this line should <em>not</em> be
    processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For every test case, if there is no minimum spanning tree,
    then output the word <tt class="ttfamily">Impossible</tt> on a
    line of its own. If there is a minimum spanning tree, then you
    first output a single line with the cost of a minimum spanning
    tree. On the following lines you output the edges of a minimum
    spanning tree. Each edge is represented on a separate line as a
    pair of numbers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (the endpoints of the
    edge) separated by a space. The edges should be output so that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x &lt; y$</span> and should be
    listed in the lexicographic order on pairs of integers.</p>
<p>If there is more than one minimum spanning tree for a given
    graph, then any one of them will do.</p>
