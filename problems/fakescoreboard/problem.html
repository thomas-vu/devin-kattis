<div class="problembody">
<p>As you know, after the award ceremony of SWERC it is
    customary to publish a complete scoreboard with detailed
    information on the submissions and verdicts received. However,
    due to the buggy contest management system, most of the
    relevant data are not being recorded today. Clearly such state
    of affairs fails to meet the high standards we are committed
    to, so the judges have resolved to make up the rest of the data
    based on whatever shred of information left, and hope
    contestants are unable to tell the difference. To make our
    lives even simpler, we kindly ask you to provide a solution for
    us, or else today’s scoreboard will remain forever veiled in
    mystery (even the fake one).</p>
<p>What we will know by the end of the contest is the number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> of teams, the number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> of problems, and the
    number of accepted submissions by each team. From the number
    and colour of balloons floating around on the premises we will
    also be able to infer how many teams solved each of the
    problems. Your task is to figure out which teams solved which
    problems.</p>
<p>Our counting skills are not up to par, so your program
    should be able to detect when the data we collected must be
    wrong (see sample input 1). Otherwise you should output a
    possible solution, represented as a sequence of T strings of P
    characters each, in the following way. Both problems and teams
    are assigned with distinct integers, from 1 to P and 1 to T ,
    respectively. For team number <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq i \leq T$</span>), write the string on alphabet <tt class="ttfamily">N</tt>,<tt class="ttfamily">Y</tt> such that its
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq j \leq P$</span>) character is
    <tt class="ttfamily">Y</tt> if the team managed to get problem
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> accepted, and
    <tt class="ttfamily">N</tt> otherwise. For example, the
    following three strings form a solution to the second sample
    case, where the score of each of three teams is <span class="tex2jax_process">$2, 1, 2$</span>, and the count of accepted
    submissions for each of three problems is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, 2$</span>:</p>
<center>
<tt class="ttfamily">NYY<br/>
      NNY<br/>
      YYN<br/></tt>
</center>
<p>There is at least one other solution, namely</p>
<center>
<tt class="ttfamily">NYY<br/>
      NYN<br/>
      YNY<br/></tt>
</center>
<p>When several solutions are possible we ask you to supply the
    one giving rise to the lexicographically smallest string, when
    each of the T rows are concatenated in order. In the example
    above we prefer the first solution, since <tt class="ttfamily">NYYNNYYYN</tt> comes before <tt class="ttfamily">NYYNYNYNY</tt> in lexicographical order. (String
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> comes before
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S’$</span> in lexicographical
    order if the first different character between the two is
    <tt class="ttfamily">N</tt> in <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> but <tt class="ttfamily">Y</tt> in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S’$</span>).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> test cases, separated by single
    blank lines. Each input case is described by three lines:</p>
<p>The first contains two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (the number of teams) and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (the number of
    problems), with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T, P \leq
    80$</span>. The second contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> space-separated integers between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span> (inclusive), the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th of which indicates the number
    of problems solved by team <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. The third (and last) line has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> integers between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span>, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th of which describes the number
    of teams successfully solving problem <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
<p>The last line of the input file will be <tt class="ttfamily">0 0</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the input data has a solution, print <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines of <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> characters each, depicting the
    lexicographically smallest solution as explained above.
    Otherwise output a single line with the word <tt class="ttfamily">Impossible</tt>. In any case a blank line should
    separate outputs for different test cases.</p>
