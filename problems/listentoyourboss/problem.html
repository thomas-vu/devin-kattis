<div class="problembody">
<p>At work, Atrebla recently became overwhelmed with orders
    from people all over his company and is trying to reduce his
    workload. He has realized that a large portion of the orders
    are from people who don’t have the authority to tell him what
    to do. By identifying such orders easily, he will be able to
    quickly discard them. At Atrebla’s company, all employees have
    one manager, except for the CEO who does not have any manager.
    Only the “management chain” of an employee has the authority
    give orders to him or her. The management chain of the CEO is
    defined as the empty set, and the management chain of any other
    employee A with manager B is defined as the set of employees
    consisting of B and B’s management chain. Talking to other
    employees in the company, Atrebla realized that many employees
    are facing the same issue.</p>
<p>Help Atrebla and other employees identify the orders they
    can discard.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N,M \leq 100\, 000$</span>), the number of employees at
    Atrebla’s company and the number of orders. Employees are
    numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> inclusive, and
    employee <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is the CEO.
    Next will follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span>
    lines, containing the manager of employees <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. It is guaranteed that the CEO is
    in the management chain of all other employees and that an
    employee is never in their own management chain. This is
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines, one
    for each order, where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th line contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a_ i, b_ i \leq N$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i \neq b_ i$</span>) meaning
    that employee <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>
    received an order from employee <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines, one
    for each order, containing “Yes” if the order should be ignored
    and “No” otherwise.</p>
