<p>The Martingale casino is creating new games to lure in new
    gamblers who tire of the standard fare. Their latest invention
    is a fast-paced game of chance called <em>Stop Counting!</em>,
    where a single customer plays with a dealer who has a deck of
    cards. Each card has some integer value.</p>
<p>One by one, the dealer reveals the cards in the deck in
    order, and keeps track of the sum of the played cards and the
    number of cards shown. At some point before a card is dealt,
    the player can call “Stop Counting!” After this, the dealer
    continues displaying cards in order, but does not include them
    in the running sums. At some point after calling “Stop
    Counting!”, and just before another card is dealt, the player
    can also call “Start Counting!” and the dealer then includes
    subsequent cards in the totals. The player can only call “Stop
    Counting!” and “Start Counting!” at most once each, and they
    must call “Stop Counting!” before they can call “Start
    Counting!”. A card is “counted” if it is dealt before the
    player calls “Stop Counting!” or is dealt after the player
    calls “Start Counting!”</p>
<p>The payout of the game is then the average value of the
    counted cards. That is, it is the sum of the counted cards
    divided by the number of counted cards. If there are no counted
    cards, the payout is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<p>You have an ‘in’ with the dealer, and you know the full deck
    in order ahead of time. What is the maximum payout you can
    achieve?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 1\, 000\,
    000$</span>, the number of cards in the deck.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space-separated integers, the
    values on the cards. The value of each card is in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-10^{9}, 10^{9}]$</span>. The
    cards are dealt in the same order they are given in the
    input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the largest attainable payout. The answer is
    considered correct if the absolute error is less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>, or the relative
    error is less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-9}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Sample Explanation</h2>
<p>In the first sample, by calling “Stop Counting!” before the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10$</span> and “Start
    Counting!” before the final <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, we can achieve an average of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10.0$</span> with the cards that
    are counted.</p>
<p>In the second sample, all values are negative, so the best
    strategy is to call “Stop Counting!” before the first card is
    dealt and call “Start Counting!” after the last card is dealt.
    Since no cards were counted, the average of the counted cards
    is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.0$</span>.</p>
