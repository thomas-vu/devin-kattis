<p>Today, Gandalf woke up from an awful dream that told him
    that the hobbit needs to be mentally prepared for the journey
    ahead. So, Gandalf decided to create a spell where it would
    replace every unique word in a sentence with a unique
    character. However, Gandalf is cheeky so he decided to test the
    hobbit by seeing whether he can check if this one-to-one
    mapping from word to character was satisfied given a string of
    characters and a sentence string. Your job is to put yourself
    in the position of the hobbit, and write the code so that it
    displays “<tt class="ttfamily">True</tt>” if every character in
    the string maps to words in the sentence in the same order,
    with every unique character consistently mapping to the same
    unique word and every unique word consistently mapping to the
    same unique character. Otherwise, display “<tt class="ttfamily">False</tt>”. Do you think you got what it takes to
    be the next Hobbit?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of two strings. The first line will contain
    the string of alphanumeric characters which will have from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters. Then, the second
    line will contain the sentence string, where every word in the
    sentence will be space-separated, and the words can only
    contain alphanumeric characters. The sentence will have from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> words and from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span> total characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display “<tt class="ttfamily">True</tt>” if each character
    from the string of characters maps one-to-one to a unique word
    in the sentence string, and that this mapping is in the same
    order. Otherwise, display “<tt class="ttfamily">False</tt>”.</p>
