<p>Gord is training for a marathon. Behind his house is a park
    with a large network of jogging trails connecting water
    stations. Gord wants to find the shortest jogging route that
    travels along every trail at least once.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of several test cases. The first line of
    input for each case contains two positive integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n\leq 15$</span>, the number of
    water stations, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m \leq 1\,
    000$</span>, the number of trails. For each trail, there is one
    subsequent line of input containing three positive integers:
    the first two, between 1 and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, indicating the water stations at
    the end points of the trail; the third indicates the length of
    the trail, in cubits at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>. There may be more than one
    trail between any two stations; each different trail is given
    only once in the input; each trail can be travelled in either
    direction. It is possible to reach any trail from any other
    trail by visiting a sequence of water stations connected by
    trails. Gord’s route may start at any water station, and must
    end at the same station. A single line containing 0 follows the
    last test case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, there should be one line of output giving the
    length of Gord’s jogging route.</p>
