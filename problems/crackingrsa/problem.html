<p>RSA is a widely used public-key cryptosystem that allows two
    parties (such as people or computers) to exchange secret
    messages without revealing information to anyone else listening
    on the conversation. Many websites use RSA when visited over a
    secure <tt class="ttfamily">https</tt> connection. In RSA, each
    party has two different keys: a <em>public</em> key that is
    published and a <em>private</em> key that is kept secret. To
    encrypt a message intended for a specific recipient, the sender
    will use the recipient’s public key to encrypt the message. The
    recipient will use their private key to decrypt the
    message.</p>
<p>An RSA public key <span class="tex2jax_process">$(n,
    e)$</span> consists of two numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span>. The number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is a product of two distinct prime
    numbers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>. In real applications,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> would be hundreds of
    decimal digits long for security.</p>
<p>Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$\varphi (n)$</span> be
    Euler’s <em>totient</em> function, which in this case is equal
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(p-1) (q-1)$</span>. The
    private key consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$(n,
    d)$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is
    the same as in the public key and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is the solution to the
    congruence</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ de \equiv 1
    \bmod \varphi (n) \]</span>
<p>Formally, a congruence</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ a
    \equiv b \bmod c \]</span>
<p>holds for three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, if there exists an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$a - b = k c$</span>.</p>
<p>The sender will encrypt a message <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (which, for simplicity, is assumed
    to be an integer smaller than both <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>) by computing <span class="tex2jax_process">$M^ e \bmod n$</span> and sending it to the
    receiver. The recipient will calculate <span class="tex2jax_process">$(M^ e)^ d \equiv M^{e d} \equiv M^{k \varphi
    (n) + 1} \equiv M^{\varphi (n) k} M \equiv M \bmod n$</span>
    since by Euler’s theorem <span class="tex2jax_process">$M^{\varphi (n)} \equiv 1 \bmod n$</span>.
    This will reconstruct the original message. Without the private
    key, no practical way has been found for a potential attacker
    to recover <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> from the
    knowledge of <span class="tex2jax_process">$M^ e \bmod
    n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(n,
    e)$</span>.</p>
<p>Your task is to crack RSA by finding the private key related
    to a specific public key.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input has the number of test cases
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le T \le 50$</span>). Each test case has
    one line that contains the two numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span>. You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the product of two primes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p, q$</span> such that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le p,q &lt; 1000$</span>.
    Also, <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> will be chosen
    so that <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> exists and is
    unique, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 &lt; d, e &lt;
    \varphi (n)$</span>. Note that the product <span class="tex2jax_process">$d e$</span> may not fit into a 32-bit
    integer (e.g. Java’s <tt class="ttfamily">int</tt> type).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the single number <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>.</p>
