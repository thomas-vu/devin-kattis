<div class="problembody">
<p>Write what you know! The judges for a certain programming
    competition have <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    problems and are trying to prepare a contest using <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> of them.</p>
<p>The judges have tagged each problem with a list of topics
    needed to solve that problem. To not overly punish teams for
    not knowing a specific topic, for any given topic, at most half
    of the problems on the contest can have that topic.</p>
<p>Compute the number of distinct contests the judges can
    prepare. Two contests are different if there is a problem that
    appears in one contest but not the other. In particular, the
    order of the problems in the contest does not matter.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input has two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n \leq 20$</span>) is the number of proposed problems and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq k \leq n$</span>) is the number of
    problems that will be used in a contest. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each begin with an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq t \leq 20$</span>), the number of
    topics for that problem. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> unique topics. Each topic is a
    string of lowercase letters, each of length at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of distinct contests the judges can
    prepare.</p>
