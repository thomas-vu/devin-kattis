        Example exam by Ellen
      </div>
</div>Ellen is teaching elementary math to her students and the
    time for the final exam has come. The exam consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> questions. In each
    question the students have to add (<span class="tex2jax_process">$+$</span>), subtract (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-$</span>) or multiply (<span class="tex2jax_process">$*$</span>) a pair of numbers.

    <p>Ellen has already chosen the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> pairs of numbers. All that remains
    is to decide for each pair which of the three possible
    operations the students should perform. To avoid students
    getting bored, Ellen wants to make sure that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> correct answers to her exam are
    all different.</p>
<p>Please help Ellen finish constructing the exam by automating
    this task.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n \leq 2\, 500$</span>), the
        number of pairs of numbers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each with
        two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^6 \leq a, b \leq 10^6$</span>), a
        pair of numbers used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each pair of numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a,b)$</span> in the same order as in the
    input, output a line containing a valid equation. Each equation
    should consist of five parts: <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, one of the three operators,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, an equals sign
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$=$</span>), and the result of
    the expression. All the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> expression results must be
    different.</p>
<p>If there are multiple valid answers you may output any of
    them. If there is no valid answer, output a single line with
    the string “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>” instead.</p>
