<p>In the game “Simon Says” one person plays the role of Simon,
    who gives instructions to everyone else playing the game. The
    tricky part is that if Simon begins his instruction with “Simon
    says” then everyone else <em>must</em> follow the instruction
    (or they lose the game); if Simon gives an instruction that
    does not begin with “Simon says” then everyone is supposed to
    completely ignore the instruction (or they lose the game)!</p>
<p>Simon tries his or her best to trick the other players into
    following the wrong instructions. Simon might begin by saying
    “Simon says touch your nose.” and follow this with “Stop
    touching your nose.” Anyone who stops touching their nose
    loses! The last player still remaining, who has correctly
    followed precisely the instructions that began with “Simon
    says” (and only these instructions), gets to be Simon next.</p>
<p>As a child, you were horrible at this game. Your older
    siblings were always able to trick you into following the wrong
    instructions. Well, you will have the last laugh: now that you
    are a computer programmer, you can write a computer program
    that can help you play the game perfectly. You only need to
    make sure the program is able to determine which instructions
    to follow and which to ignore.</p>
<p>Are you up to the challenge? Can you craft a computer
    program that <em>never</em> makes any mistakes in the game? If
    you can, then surely fame and glory shall come your way for
    being the most unstoppable player of Simon Says ever!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 1\, 000$</span>. Each of the
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines is one
    command, of length at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters. Each command is a
    sequence of one or more words. Each word uses only lower and
    uppercase characters a–z. Each pair of words is separated by a
    single space. The command ends in a period.</p>
<p>Some commands begin with “Simon says”, and others may not.
    The phrase “Simon says” only occurs at the beginning of a
    command. If a command begins with “Simon says”, there is
    another space and at least one additional word after “says”. No
    lines contain leading or trailing space.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line that begins with precisely “Simon says”,
    output the rest of the line. Each line that does not begin with
    precisely “Simon says” should be ignored.</p>
