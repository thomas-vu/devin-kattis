<p>Having dropped out of school because of chemistry, Luka got
    a job driving trucks. One evening he parked his three trucks in
    a rest area which charges for parking in an unusual way – they
    give a discount on quantity.</p>
<p>When only one truck is parked, the driver pays <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> kuna per minute. When two trucks
    are parked, the drivers each pay <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> kuna per minute. When three trucks
    are parked, the drivers each pay <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> kuna per minute.</p>
<p>Given the numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, as well as the intervals in which
    Luka’s three trucks are parked, determine how much Luka needs
    to pay the owner of the rest area.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le C \le B \le A \le 100$</span>), the prices of parking as
    defined above. Each of the following three lines contains two
    integers each. These are the arrival and departure times (in
    minutes) of one of Luka’s trucks. The arrival time will always
    be earlier than the departure time. All time indexes will be
    between 1 and 100.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the overall cost of Luka’s parking his three
    trucks.</p>
