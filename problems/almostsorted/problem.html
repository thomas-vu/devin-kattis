</div>In a modified version of cycle sort, an array is sorted
    by swapping pairs of elements such that each swap puts at least
    one element in its correct final position. Specifically, the
    algorithm sorts the array in increasing order by performing
    zero or more sorting iterations on each index, starting from
    index <span class="tex2jax_process">$i=0$</span>, where a
    sorting iteration consists of swapping the
    element <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> in
    index <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> with some
    other element, such that after the swap, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is sorted. (An element is
    called sorted if completely sorting the array would not change
    the position of that element.) This places a new array element
    in index <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. These
    sorting iterations on index <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> continue until the element in
    index <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is sorted,
    at which point <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is
    incremented, and the whole process repeats. Eventually, when
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> has progressed through
    all valid array indices, the entire array will be sorted, and
    the algorithm terminates.
    <p>In this sorting algorithm, some elements get sorted sooner
    than others. Given an array, and an element <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>, it is your task to determine the
    state of the array when element <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> is first sorted.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a line containing a single
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the
    length of the array <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\leq n\leq
    200\, 000)$</span>. The second line contains the initial state
    of the array — <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> distinct space-separated
    integers, each less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{31}$</span> in absolute value, beginning
    with the element in index <span class="tex2jax_process">$i=0$</span>. The last line contains a single
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>, the
    query. It is guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> is one of the elements of the
    array.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space-separated values, the state
    of the array when <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> is
    first sorted.</p>
