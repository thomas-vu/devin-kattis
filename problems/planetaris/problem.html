<p>Oh, no. Atli has just painted himself into a corner. He has
    been playing the video game <em>Planetaris</em> and decided to
    start a war against his friend Finni. The downside is Finni had
    a considerably larger spaceship fleet than Atli expected. Atli
    now needs your help to turn the tide, by determining how many
    fights Atli can win.</p>
<p>Each space fight takes place in a solar system. This early
    in <em>Planetaris</em> all the spaceships are identical. Since
    Atli spent most of his Intergalactic Super Kurrency (ISK) on an
    eavesdropping station he knows to which solar systems Finniâ€™s
    fleets are going and how many ships are in each fleet. If Atli
    sends fewer ships than Finni to a particular solar system he
    will lose and Finni gains control of the solar system. If they
    send the same number of ships there will be no ships left over
    to claim the system, so there is no winner. However if Atli
    sends more ships than Finni to a system he wins the battle and
    gains control of that solar system.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a \leq 10^9$</span>,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of
    solar systems and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is
    the total number of ships Atli has at his disposal. The next
    line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq e_ i \leq 10^9$</span>,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_ i$</span> indicates
    Finni is sending <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_ i$</span>
    ships to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th solar
    system.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The only line of the output should contain an integer
    indicating the largest number of battles Atli can win if he
    plays optimally.</p>
