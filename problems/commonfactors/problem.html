<p>Everyone likes to share things in common with other
    people.</p>
<p>Numbers are the same way! Numbers like it when they have a
    factor in common.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> share a common factor
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, which gives them
    something to talk about.</p>
<p>For a given integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, we define a function,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(n)$</span>, equal to the
    number of integers in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$\left[1, n\right]$</span> that share a
    common factor greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we can define a second function, <span class="tex2jax_process">$g(n)$</span>, which characterizes the
    fraction of numbers that like a given number as follows:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$g(n)$</span> = <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{f(n)}{n}$</span></p>
<p>What we really want to know though, is, for any integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq k \leq n$</span>, what is
    the maximum value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$g(k)$</span>?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n \leq 10^{18}$</span>), the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> for the input case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For the provided test case, output the result as a fraction,
    in lowest terms, in the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>/<span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> where the greatest common divisor
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
