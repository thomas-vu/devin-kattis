<p>Oh no! Chalmers Challenge is only one day away and <a href="https://codingclub.chs.chalmers.se/"><span class="scshape">Chalmers Coding Club</span></a> havenâ€™t had the time
    to prepare all tasks. As we all know, competitive programming
    problems are created by combining funny problem statements with
    computer programming methods. There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_{uniq}+A_{reuse}$</span> problem statement
    themes and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_{uniq}+B_{reuse}$</span> algorithmic
    methods. Some of these are one-trick ponies that only work once
    while others are so good they never get old. Out of all the
    themes and methods, only <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_{reuse}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_{reuse}$</span> are good enough to be
    reused continually. How many different problems can be created
    by combining all these themes and methods?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of one line with four space-separated
    integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le A_{uniq},
    B_{uniq}, A_{reuse}, B_{reuse} \le 10^9$</span>, the number of
    single-use themes and methods and the number of reusable themes
    and methods respectively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the number of problems that can be
    created in total.</p>
