<p>Ingrid is the founder and CEO of bicycle retailer BIKEA. The
    company sells bicycles for customers to assemble
    themselves.</p>
<p>BIKEA has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> different
    bicycles to offer. Ingrid wants to give each of them a
    human-readable name, to make it easy to remember. But doing
    this by hand is a very time consuming task.</p>
<p>You are given the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, and your task is to generate
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> different names. To
    make the names readable, they must satisfy the following:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Each name has length between <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>, and only consists of
        lowercase English letters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three consecutive letters of a name cannot all be vowels
        or consonants. Here we consider <tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">e</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">i</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">o</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">u</tt> vowels, while the remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$21$</span> letters are consonants.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, <tt class="ttfamily">hello</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">bar</tt>, and <tt class="ttfamily">lkab</tt> are all
    valid names, whereas <tt class="ttfamily">ingrid</tt>,
    <tt class="ttfamily">bo</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">louise</tt> are invalid.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 30\, 000$</span>), the number of names to
    generate.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, each
    of them containing a name. It can be proven that it is possible
    to generate <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> different
    names.</p>
