<div class="problembody">
<p>When you’ve finished solving all problems in this contest,
    there’s no need to get bored, be- cause we introduce a new and
    fun game called Black Out! Grab a piece of paper and draw a
    table of 5 by 6 squares. Next, choose your favorite teammate to
    play against. Each player in turn selects one or more squares
    that are adjacent and in the same row or column, and colors
    them all black. Some of these squares may be black already, but
    at least one of them must not be. The winner is the player to
    color the last square(s) black.</p>
<p>Once you got the hang of it, you might want to try and write
    your own AI player. You can then submit it and let it play a
    few games against our (= the jury’s) player!</p>
<p>After a lengthy analysis, we have managed to prove that the
    game is theoretically won by the player who starts, so we’ll
    gracefully let your player have the first move every time. If
    you manage to beat our player in every game, you’ll be awarded
    another point in this contest. But be careful: the jury’s
    player is not to be underestimated and will surely grab any
    chance it is offered! If you lose, you’ll get a Wrong Answer.
    Also note that we are not that patient, so make sure your
    player is quick to move.</p>

<h2>Input and Output</h2>
<p><b class="bfseries">This is a problem with interactive input
    and output, read the following description very
    carefully.</b></p>
<p>The first line of the input contains one positive number:
    the number of games, at most 100. Then, for each game:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Your program writes a move on a single line to standard
        output. A move consists of four space-separated integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le r1 \le r2 \le 5$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le c1 \le c2 \le
        6$</span>; also, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r1 =
        r2$</span> and/or <span class="tex2jax_process">$c1 =
        c2$</span>) on a single line: the row and column number of
        the two squares between which all squares are colored black
        (including the two indicated squares). In case only one
        square is colored black, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r1
        = r2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c1 =
        c2$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After each move, our program writes one of the following
        two responses on a single line to standard input:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The word “<tt class="ttfamily">MOVE</tt>”, followed
            by a single space, followed by four space-separated
            integers, representing the response of our program.
            Your program must now make another move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The word “<tt class="ttfamily">GAME</tt>”,
            indicating that the game has ended: either your program
            has won, or our program intends to make a move that
            ends the game in its favor.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Make sure to print a newline after your move.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b class="bfseries">C Users</b></p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Do <tt class="ttfamily">setlinebuf(stdout);</tt> at the
        start of your program to make sure output is flushed
        correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you use <tt class="ttfamily">scanf</tt> to read the
        moves (which we recommend), then do not read the newline
        character at the end. So, to read the input with scanf, use
        <tt class="ttfamily">scanf("%s",s)</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">scanf("%d %d %d %d", &amp;r1, &amp;c1, &amp;r2,
        &amp;c2);</tt>.<br/>
        Also, do not use <tt class="ttfamily">scanf("MOVE")</tt> or
        <tt class="ttfamily">scanf("GAME")</tt>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b class="bfseries">C++ Users</b></p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Recommendation: use <tt class="ttfamily">std::cin</tt>
        and <tt class="ttfamily">std::cout</tt> to read input and
        write output. This will ensure output is flushed
        correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b class="bfseries">Java users</b></p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Do <em>not</em> use buffered output; <tt class="ttfamily">System.out.println</tt> will do fine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sample Interaction</h2>
<p><b class="bfseries">Notes:</b></p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>This example is merely to illustrate the communication
        between your program and the jury’s program; it does not
        demonstrate an example of optimal play for either
        player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The extra newlines in the example below are for clarity
        only, to demonstrate the order of events; you should print
        exactly one newline character after each move, and the
        input contains no blank lines either.</p>
