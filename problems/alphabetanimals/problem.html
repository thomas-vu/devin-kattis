      </div>
</div>You are playing a game in which a group of players take
    turns saying animal names. The animal name you say when it is
    your turn must start with the same letter as the previously
    said animal ends with and it must not have been said previously
    in this round of the game. If there is no valid name or you
    cannot come up with one you are eliminated.
    <p>Given the last animal name said before your turn and a list
    of all names not yet used, can you make it through this turn?
    If so, can you make sure to eliminate the next player?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single word, the animal
    that the previous player just said. The next line contains a
    single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n \leq 10^5$</span>), the
    number of valid unused animal names. Each of the following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contains one
    valid unused animal name.</p>
<p>All animal names (including the one the previous player
    said) are unique and consist of at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> lower case letters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>’-‘<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>’.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If there is any animal name you can play that eliminates the
    next player, output the first such name from the input list,
    followed by an exclamation mark. Otherwise, if there is any
    animal name that you can play, output the first such name.
    Otherwise, output a question mark (in this case you will just
    have to make up a fake name in the hope that the others will
    trust you that this is a real animal).</p>
