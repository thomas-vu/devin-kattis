<div class="problembody">
<p>An ultra-marathon is a race that takes place over an
    uncomfortably long distance and time, typically lasting for
    five hours or more. You are part of a group of three
    ultra-marathon runners looking to place in this year’s Great
    South-to-North run from Plymouth to Aberdeen.</p>
<p>You have a set number of days until the next race to train.
    You will all train together, as training alone can be
    dangerous. As everyone has their own schedule in mind for how
    many kilometres to run per day, this will not be easy, you will
    have to compromise.</p>
<p>The fairest option is to look at each day individually,
    examine the three options for how far to run, and to take the
    median one. That is to say, the option taken for each day
    should be one that is not be greater or lesser than both of the
    other possibilities at the same time.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>A line with the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 1000$</span>), the number of
        days of training.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_{1,\ldots
        ,n}$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq k \leq
        10^6$</span>), your ideal daily distances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{1,\ldots
        ,n}$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq a \leq
        10^6$</span>), your first colleague’s ideal daily
        distances.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_{1,\ldots
        ,n}$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq b \leq
        10^6$</span>), your second colleague’s ideal daily
        distances.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a plan for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> days as <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers, where the distance for
    every day corresponds to the median of choices for that
    day.</p>
