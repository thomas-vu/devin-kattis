<p>Rhythm is an important part of music and it is crucial for
    aspiring musicians to gain understanding of it. As the skill of
    the musician advances, more complex rhythms are introduced to
    them. To ease the learning of musical passages, a method of
    simplifying rhythms can be helpful. One method is to reduce the
    rhythm into groups of twos and threes.</p>
<p>A rhythm is composed of multiple beats. A single beat does
    not make up a rhythm, as the beats depend on each other. The
    rhythm can be subdivided into smaller components. For example,
    a rhythm of <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> beats can
    be subdivided into <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>
    beats and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> beats, or
    alternatively into <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> beats. However, a rhythm of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> beats cannot be
    subdivided into <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> beats, since one of the components
    does not form a rhythm.</p>
<p>This leaves <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> as the
    smallest group size of beats we can use to decompose a rhythm,
    but if we only use groups of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> then we cannot have an odd number
    of beats. Adding <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> as a
    group size allows us to decompose any rhythm, even if it has an
    odd number of beats.</p>
<p>Given the number of beats in a rhythm, provide one
    decomposition of the rhythm into groups of sizes <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 10^6$</span>), denoting the
    number of beats in the rhythm.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>First output one line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, the number of groups of which
    your decomposition consists. Then output a line with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> space-separated
    integers, each of which is a <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> or a <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. Your decomposition must be made
    up of the correct number of beats.</p>
<p>If there are multiple correct answers, you may output any of
    them.</p>
