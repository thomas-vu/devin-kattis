<p>Your boss gave you the task of creating a walking maze, and
    you are evaluating different designs. Before you commit to one,
    you want to know how quickly people can move in and out of each
    different maze. After all, your boss is interested in making
    money on this venture and, the faster people can move through,
    the more paying customers you can handle.</p>
<p>A maze is a set of numbered rooms and passages connecting
    the rooms. The mazeâ€™s only entrance is at the lowest-numbered
    room and the only exit is at the highest-numbered room.</p>
<p>Each passage has a limit in the number of people that can
    pass through at a time. For two rooms numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> have a common factor greater than
    one, then there is a passage between <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>. The largest common factor
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is the number of
    people per minute that can walk from <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>. Simultaneously, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> people per minute can also be
    walking from <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>. The entrance, exit,
    and rooms can handle any number of people walking through at a
    time. People want to get through the maze as quickly as
    possible, so they do not wait around in the rooms.</p>
<p>Here are illustrations of the two sample inputs. Boxes
    represent the numbered rooms, and each arrow is a passage
    labeled by the number of people per minute that can walk
    through it.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input is a single maze description. The first line is an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq
    1000$</span> indicating the number of rooms in the maze. This
    is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> unique
    integers, one per line, which are the room numbers for the
    maze. Each room number is in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[2,~ 2\times 10^9]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the maximum number of people per minute that can enter
    the maze, assuming that people are exiting the maze at the same
    speed as people entering. No maze supports more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> people entering per
    minute.</p>
