</div>Alice and Bob are playing a board game with a deck of
    nine cards. For each digit between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, there is one card with that digit
    on it. Alice and Bob each draw two cards after shuffling the
    cards, and see the digits on their own cards without revealing
    the digits to each other. Then Alice gives her two cards to
    Bob. Bob sees the digits on Alice’s cards and lays all the four
    cards on the table in increasing order by the digits. Cards are
    laid facing down.
    <p>Bob tells Alice the positions of her two cards. The goal of
    Alice is to guess the digits on Bob’s two cards. Can Alice
    uniquely determine these two digits and guess them
    correctly?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input has two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p,
    q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p &lt; q \leq
    9$</span>) on the first line, giving the digits on Alice’s
    cards. The next line has a string containing two ‘<tt class="tt">A</tt>’s and two ‘<tt class="tt">B</tt>’s, giving the
    positions of Alice’s and Bob’s cards on the table. It is
    guaranteed that Bob correctly sorts the cards and gives the
    correct positions of Alice’s cards.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If Alice can uniquely determine the two digits on Bob’s
    cards, output the two digits on a single line, starting with
    the smaller digit. Otherwise, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
