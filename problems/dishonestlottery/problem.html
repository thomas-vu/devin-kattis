<p>You suspect your local lottery of cheating! Some numbers are
    coming up too often!</p>
<p>Each week, the lottery randomly selects five numbers in the
    range from one to fifty. So, each number should appear about
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\% $</span> of the time if the
    numbers are truly chosen randomly. If a number appears far more
    than that, it’s suspicious!</p>
<p>Determine if a set of lottery drawings is suspicious by
    listing all numbers that appear too often. To allow for random
    error, you’ll need to flag any number that appears more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20\% $</span> of the time.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>). There will be
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10 \cdot n$</span> lottery
    results for you to analyze.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$10 \cdot
    n$</span> lines contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le x \le 50$</span>). Each line represents a drawing. All
    values on a line are unique.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>On a single line, output all numbers that appear strictly
    more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \cdot n$</span>
    times in the list. If there is more than one, output them
    space-separated, in sorted order from smallest to largest. If
    there aren’t any, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
