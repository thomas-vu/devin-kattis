<p>A regular bracket-sequence is a string of characters
    consisting only of opening and closing brackets, and satisfying
    the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>An empty string is a regular bracket-sequence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> is a regular
        bracket-sequence, then <tt class="ttfamily">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>)</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">[<span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>]</tt>
        and <tt class="ttfamily">{<span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>}</tt> are also regular
        bracket-sequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> are regular
        bracket-sequences, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$AB$</span> is also a regular
        bracket-sequence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the sequences “<tt class="ttfamily">[({})]</tt>”, “<tt class="ttfamily">[](){}</tt>” and
    “<tt class="ttfamily">[{}]()[{}]</tt>” are regular, but the
    sequences “<tt class="ttfamily">[({{([</tt>”, “<tt class="ttfamily">[]({)}</tt>” and “<tt class="ttfamily">[{}])([{}]</tt>” are not.</p>
<p>Ivica has found a string which looks like it could be a
    regular bracket-sequence. Some of the characters have become
    smudged and illegible, and could have been any character.</p>
<p>Write a program that calculates how many ways the illegible
    characters in the string can be replaced by brackets so that
    the result is a regular bracket-sequence. This number can be
    very large, so output only its last <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> digits.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an even integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 200$</span>), the length of the string. The second
    line contains the string. Illegible characters are represented
    by the ‘<tt class="ttfamily">?</tt>’ character.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of regular bracket-sequences the string
    could have read.</p>
