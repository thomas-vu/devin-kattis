<div class="problembody">
<p>A train line has two stations on it, A and B. Trains can
    take trips from A to B or from B to A multiple times during a
    day. When a train arrives at B from A (or arrives at A from B),
    it needs a certain amount of time before it is ready to take
    the return journey – this is the <i class="it">turnaround
    time</i>. For example, if a train arrives at 12:00 and the
    turnaround time is 0 minutes, it can leave immediately, at
    12:00.</p>
<p>A train timetable specifies departure and arrival time of
    all trips between A and B. The train company needs to know how
    many trains have to start the day at A and B in order to make
    the timetable work: whenever a train is supposed to leave A or
    B, there must actually be one there ready to go. There are
    passing sections on the track, so trains don’t necessarily
    arrive in the same order that they leave. Trains may not travel
    on trips that do not appear on the schedule.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input gives the number of cases,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S\leq 100$</span>.</p>
<p>Each case contains a number of lines. The first line is the
    turnaround time, <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, in
    minutes. The next line has two numbers on it, <span class="tex2jax_process">$NA$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$NB$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$NA$</span> is the number of trips from A to
    B, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$NB$</span> is the number
    of trips from B to A. Then there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$NA$</span> lines giving the details of the
    trips from A to B.</p>
<p>Each line contains two fields, giving the HH:MM departure
    and arrival time for that trip. The departure time for each
    trip will be earlier than the arrival time. All arrivals and
    departures occur on the same day. The trips may appear in any
    order - they are not necessarily sorted by time. The hour and
    minute values are both two digits, zero-padded, and are on a
    24-hour clock (00:00 through 23:59).</p>
<p>After these <span class="tex2jax_process">$NA$</span> lines,
    there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$NB$</span> lines
    giving the departure and arrival times for the trips from B to
    A.</p>
<p>You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq NA,
    NB\leq 100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq
    T\leq 60$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing "Case
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>: " followed by the
    number of trains that must start at A and the number of trains
    that must start at B.</p>
