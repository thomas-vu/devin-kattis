<p>Arty has been an abstract artist since childhood, and his
    works have taken on many forms. His latest (and most pricey)
    creations are lovingly referred to as Abstract Art within the
    abstract art community (they’re not the most original bunch
    when it comes to loving nicknames). Here’s an example of one of
    Arty’s recent works:</p>
<div class="figure" id="abstract_arc_1">

<div class="caption">
<b>Figure 1</b>: An example of Arty’s art.
        </div>

</div>
<p>As you can see, Abstract Art is created by painting
    (possibly overlapping) polygons. When Arty paints one of his
    designs he always paints each polygon completely before moving
    on to the next one.</p>
<p>The price of individual pieces of Arty’s Abstract Art varies
    greatly based on their aesthetic appeal, but collectors demand
    two pieces of information about each painting:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>the total amount of paint used, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the total amount of canvas covered.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that the first value will be larger than the second
    whenever there is overlap between two or more polygons. Both of
    these values can be calculated from a list containing the
    vertices of all the polygons used in the painting, but Arty
    can’t waste his time on such plebeian pursuits — he has great
    art to produce! I guess it’s left up to you.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100$</span>) representing the
    number of polygons to be painted. Following this are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each describing
    a painted polygon. Each polygon description starts with an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq m \leq 20$</span>) indicating the
    number of sides in the polygon, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> pairs of integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq x, y \leq 1\, 000)$</span> specifying the coordinates of
    the vertices of the polygon in consecutive order. Polygons may
    be concave but no polygon will cross itself. No point on the
    canvas will be touched by more than two polygon border
    segments.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display both the total amount of paint used and the amount
    of canvas covered. Your answers must have a relative or
    absolute error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
