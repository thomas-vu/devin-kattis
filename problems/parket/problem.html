<div class="problembody">
<p>Ivica has set up a new parquet flooring in his room. The
    room is <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> decimeters
    long and <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> decimeters
    wide.</p>
<p>The blocks are of quadratic shape and each has an area of
    one quadratic decimeter. Once Ivica had set up the flooring,
    which consists of <em>brown</em>-colored blocks, he decided to
    paint the blocks <em>on the edge</em> of the room
    <em>red</em>.</p>
<p>The picture below illustrates the scenario from the Sample
    Input 2 - outer blocks are red, while the remaining two inner
    blocks are brown:</p>

<p>Marica has come to visit Ivica. While Ivica was serving her
    cookies, she counted the number of blocks of each color. When
    she returned home, she recalled of the two numbers and wished
    to calculate the dimensions of Ivicaâ€™s room. Help her!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains two integers
    separated by a space, <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>
    (the number of red blocks) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (the number of brown blocks). The
    following constraints will apply: <span class="tex2jax_process">$8 \le R \le 5\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le B \le 2\, 000\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the
    dimensions of the room, <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>, respectively. If the numbers
    differ, output the greater one first. The test data will be
    such that the solution is unique.</p>
