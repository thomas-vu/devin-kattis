<div class="problembody">
<p>Given is <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> points
    with integer coordinates in the plane. Is it is possible to
    construct a simple, that is non-intersecting, rectilinear
    polygon with the given points as vertices? In a rectilinear
    polygon there are at least 4 vertices and every edge is either
    horizontal or vertical; each vertex is an endpoint of exactly
    one horizontal edge and one vertical edge. There are no holes
    in a polygon.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input is an integer giving the number of
    cases that follow. The input of each case starts with an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$4\leq n\leq 100\,
    000$</span> giving the number of points for this test case. It
    is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> pairs
    of integers specifying the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates of the points for this
    case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should contain one line for each case on input.
    Each line should contain one integer number giving the length
    of the rectilinear polygon passing through the given points
    when it exists; otherwise, it should contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
