<p>Congratulations! Your team has advanced to the next round of
    the International Cupcake Production Competition (ICPC)! To
    participate in the competition, you are going to fly to Cupcake
    City from your hometown. The competition organizers have just
    shared good news: generous sponsors will support you with your
    flight ticket!</p>
<p>Here’s how it works. You have already obtained a list of
    available flights. Among those options, you first report the
    price of any one potential flight. This determines the
    <em>reimbursement limit</em> of your trip; sponsors would pay
    you <em>up to half that price</em>. Next, you actually purchase
    your flight ticket. This flight may or may not be the same as
    the flight you report for the reimbursement limit. Finally, you
    show the receipt of your purchase, and sponsors will reimburse
    you the minimum of your actual cost and the reimbursement
    limit.</p>
<p>Now, you want to figure out your minimum possible
    <em>net</em> cost—the price you pay, minus the amount you get
    reimbursed. Naturally, you will report the price of the most
    expensive flight ticket and buy the cheapest flight ticket.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input is an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 50$</span>), the number of available flights.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$10
    \leq P \leq 10^5$</span>), which is the price of a flight
    ticket from your hometown to Cupcake City, in dollars. It is
    guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is a
    multiple of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the minimum amount, in dollars,
    that you have to pay for a flight ticket, excluding the amount
    of travel support from sponsors.</p>
