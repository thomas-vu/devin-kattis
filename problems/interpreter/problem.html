<div class="problembody">
<p>A certain computer has <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> registers and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span> words of RAM. Each register or
    RAM location holds a <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-digit integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$999$</span>. Instructions are encoded as
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-digit integers and
    stored in RAM. The encodings are as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1xy$</span> means halt
        (regardless of the values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$2dn$</span> means set
        register <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> to
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (between
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$3dn$</span> means add
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> to register
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$4dn$</span> means
        multiply register <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>
        by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$5ds$</span> means set
        register <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> to the
        value of register <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$6ds$</span> means add the
        value of register <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
        to register <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$7ds$</span> means
        multiply register <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>
        by the value of register <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$8da$</span> means set
        register <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> to the
        value in RAM whose address is in register <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$9sa$</span> means set the
        value in RAM whose address is in register <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> to the value of register
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0ds$</span> means goto
        the location in register <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> unless register <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All registers initially contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$000$</span>. The first instruction to be
    executed is at RAM address <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. All results of add/multiply
    instructions are reduced modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The initial content of the RAM is read from standard input.
    The input to your program consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-digit unsigned integers,
    representing the contents of consecutive RAM locations starting
    at <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. Unspecified RAM
    locations are initialized to <span class="tex2jax_process">$000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output from your program is a single integer: the number
    of instructions executed up to and including the halt
    instruction. You may assume that the program does halt and
    takes at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>
    steps.</p>
