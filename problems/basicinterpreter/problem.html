<p>The BASIC computer programming language has been popular for
    many years, and there have been dozens of ‘dialects’ of the
    language. It’s considered a high-level language and is
    typically interpreted (rather than compiled). For this problem,
    write an interpreter for a restricted dialect of BASIC. Here is
    a description of the language.</p>
<p>Each input line contains one statement. Each statement
    begins with a non-negative integer, which we will call its
    label. Following the label is a single space and one of the
    following commands (with explanations following):</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt>LET X = &lt;ARITHMETIC_STATEMENT&gt;</tt><br/>
        Assign the result of the arithmetic statement to variable
        <tt>X</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt>IF &lt;CONDITION&gt; THEN GOTO L</tt><br/>
        If the boolean given is true, then go to the statement
        labeled <tt>L</tt>, where <tt>L</tt> is a valid label. (If
        the condition is not true, continue execution to the
        statement with the next lowest label.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt>PRINT &lt;PRINT_STATEMENT&gt;</tt><br/>
        Produce output, without an appended newline.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt>PRINTLN &lt;PRINT_STATEMENT&gt;</tt><br/>
        Produce output, with an appended newline.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are details on types, variables, and the terms
    <tt>&lt;ARITHMETIC_STATEMENT&gt;</tt>,
    <tt>&lt;CONDITION&gt;</tt>, and
    <tt>&lt;PRINT_STATEMENT&gt;</tt> used above.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>All numeric values (in the input and for the variable
        representation) are signed 32-bit integers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All variables are single uppercase characters
        (<tt>A</tt> through <tt>Z</tt>). They are all global in
        scope, and are all initialized to zero before program
        execution begins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt>&lt;ARITHMETIC_STATEMENT&gt;</tt> is one of the
        following: <tt>X</tt>, <tt>X + Y</tt>, <tt>X - Y</tt>,
        <tt>X * Y</tt>, or <tt>X / Y</tt>. Here, <tt>X</tt> and
        <tt>Y</tt> each indicate either a variable or an
        integer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt>&lt;CONDITION&gt;</tt> is one of the following:
        <tt>X = Y</tt>, <tt>X &gt; Y</tt>, <tt>X &lt; Y</tt>, <tt>X
        &lt;&gt; Y</tt>, <tt>X &lt;= Y</tt>, or <tt>X &gt;= Y</tt>.
        Again, <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> each indicate either a
        variable or an integer. Here, <tt>&lt;&gt;</tt> indicates
        inequality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt>&lt;PRINT_STATEMENT&gt;</tt> is either a variable
        name or a literal string delimited by double quotes. Inside
        the quotes, the string contains only alphanumeric
        characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and spaces.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the signed 32-bit arithmetic, the usual rules of
    truncation towards zero (for division) and overflow (for
    addition and multiplication) and underflow (for subtraction)
    apply. The following examples illustrate these conditions:</p>
<pre>
5 / 2           = 2                  65536 * 32768   = -2147483648
-1 / 2          = 0                  -65536 * 32768  = -2147483648
2147483647 + 1  = -2147483648        -2147483648 * 2 = 0
-2147483648 - 1 = 2147483647         2147483647 * 2  = -2
</pre>
<p>Further, division by zero will not occur.</p>
<p>Program execution begins with the statement having the
    smallest label, and proceeds with the statement having the next
    smallest label. (Unless a <tt>GOTO</tt> executes, in which case
    execution proceeds at the designated label.) The program halts
    after it has completed the statement with the largest label
    (which is guaranteed not to contain a <tt>GOTO</tt>).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single program. Each line contains a
    single valid statement. Each pair of adjacent tokens in the
    input is separated by a single space. Integers in the input
    will all be in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$-2^{31}$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{31}-1$</span>. Input ends at end of
    file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Give the output (<tt>PRINT</tt> and <tt>PRINTLN</tt>
    statements) of the input program when it is executed.</p>
