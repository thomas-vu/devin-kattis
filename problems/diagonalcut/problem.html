<p>Quido and Hugo are making a chocolate cake. The central
    ingredient of the cake is a large chocolate bar, lying
    unwrapped on the kitchen table. The bar is an <span class="tex2jax_process">$M \times N$</span> rectangular grid of
    chocolate blocks. All of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$MN$</span> blocks are rectangles of
    identical shape and size. The chocolate bar is of top quality
    and the friends want to eat part of it, before the rest is used
    in the cake.</p>
<p>“OK,” says Quido, “let’s divide the whole bar into two
    triangular chunks by a straight diagonal cut from its
    upper-left corner to its lower-right corner. We will then eat
    all of the blocks which have been cut exactly in half, into two
    equal-area pieces. You will eat one half and I will eat the
    other half of each such block. All other blocks, that is, the
    blocks which are either uncut or cut into two parts of
    different sizes, will go directly into the cake. Of course, we
    will make sure the cut is perfectly precise.</p>
<p>Let’s see how much chocolate we get to eat!”</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> given on a single line, (where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M, N \leq
    10^{18}$</span>). The numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> denote the number of blocks in one
    column and in one row, respectively, in the chocolate bar.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the number of blocks of the chocolate bar which are
    cut into exactly two pieces of equal area.</p>
