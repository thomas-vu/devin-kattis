<p>Baxter Scott owns The Enlightened Dairy Co., a dairy company
    with magical cows. Early each morning, he brushes his teeth,
    strolls outside, and finds that the cows have doubled in
    number. With double the number of cows, he can produce double
    the quantity of milk. While he is ecstatic that he has so many
    cows and so much milk, the Dairy Regulator forces him to keep
    at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> cows on any
    given farm, which greatly complicates his business.</p>
<p>At The Enlightened Dairy Co., Baxter has access to an
    unlimited number of farms, each with a maximum capacity of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> cows. On each farm,
    cows reproduce at the same rate: they always double in number
    when the clock strikes midnight. To stay within the Regulator’s
    rules, whenever a farm has strictly more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> cows, Baxter selects half of the
    cows on that farm and moves them to an entirely new, empty
    farm. More precisely, if there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$D \leq C$</span> cows on a farm, he leaves
    all <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> cows on the farm,
    but if there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$D &gt;
    C$</span> cows on a farm, he leaves <span class="tex2jax_process">$\left\lceil \frac{D}{2} \right\rceil
    $</span> cows on the farm and takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$\left\lfloor \frac{D}{2} \right\rfloor
    $</span> cows to a new, empty farm. (Here <span class="tex2jax_process">$\left\lceil \ \right\rceil $</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\left\lfloor \ \right\rfloor
    $</span> denote the ceiling and floor functions, which round
    up/down to the nearest integer, respectively.) He does this
    early every morning, before the Regulator could possibly show
    up, so that he can avoid paying hefty Moo Fees.</p>
<p>The Regulator needs to know how many farms she will be
    inspecting when she visits The Enlightened Dairy Co. The
    Regulator inspects every farm that has at least one cow, and
    does not inspect any farm with zero cows. Given the number of
    cows on each farm with at least one cow on
    Day <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, compute the
    number of farms that need inspecting on any given day.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three space-separated
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C \leq 1\,
    000$</span>)</span> is the maximum number of cows allowed on a
    farm, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq N
    \leq 1\, 000$</span>)</span> is the number of farms with at
    least one cow on Day <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq
    50$</span>)</span> is the number of different days on which the
    Regulator visits. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines of input each have a single
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span>
<span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq c_ i \leq C$</span>)</span>,
    representing the number of cows on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> farms on Day <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. The final <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines each have a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ j$</span> <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq d_
    j \leq 50$</span>)</span>, representing a day when the
    Regulator visits. All <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_
    j$</span> are distinct.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ j$</span>, output
    one line with a single integer: the number of farms the
    Regulator will inspect on Day <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ j$</span>.</p>
