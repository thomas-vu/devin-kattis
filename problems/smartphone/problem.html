<p>You have a very smart phone. Here is the user experience
    when entering a word:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>You decide on the word you want to write.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You start typing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At some point, three suggestions appear. The list of
        suggestions never changes after it has first been
        presented, even if you keep typing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You always only get three suggestions. This would mean that
    the suggestions would not always fit on the screen. However,
    when this happens they are read aloud by a text to speech
    plugin that cost $9.99. Yes, it reads all the suggestions for
    every character you enter until you take one of the
    suggestions.</p>
<p>Since it’s a very smart phone, you can only do the
    following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Replace what you have written so far with one of the
        suggestions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hit the backspace button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enter a letter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these options takes one keypress. An example: you
    want to enter the text CAKEEATER. When the suggestions appear,
    you had gotten to CAK. Let’s say you decide to take the
    suggestion CAKEMONSTER, remove MONSTER and enter EATER. This
    would mean that you used 1+7+5=13 keypresses to get to the word
    CAKEEATER. The only time you would want to do this is when you
    want to annoy the cookie monster. Also, a lot of keypresses
    could have been avoided here if we had made different
    decisions.</p>
<p>Write a program that <em>minimize</em> the amount of
    keypresses given the current input, the desired word and the
    three suggestions from your very smart phone.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of a single integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the number of test
    cases.<br/>
    For each test case there will be five lines:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The word you want to type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What has been written so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suggestion 1</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suggestion 2</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Suggestion 3.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq
        50$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All line lengths will be greater than zero, and less
        than or equal to 25.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All lines consist of only uppercase characters from the
        English alphabet (<tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>–<tt class="ttfamily">Z</tt>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the minimum number of keypresses
    needed to get to the desired word.</p>
