<p>Everyone knows that cats love to eat mice. Naturally, when
    given the opportunity, any cat wants to eat as many mice as
    possible.</p>
<p>It just so happens that Cartesian Cat lives on the Cartesian
    Plane with her home located at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 0)$</span>. Obviously, none of the mice
    live at this location, they are smarter than that! However, the
    mice aren’t terribly smart. They live on the plane with
    Cartesian Cat and at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t =
    0$</span>, stick their heads above the ground, in sight of
    Cartesian Cat. Each of the mice stays in sight at its location
    for a specified amount of time before ducking back underground,
    where Cartesian Cat can’t get it.</p>
<p>Cartesian Cat has a plan. At time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t = 0$</span>, she’ll run straight towards a
    mouse, eat it instantaneously, and then head for another mouse,
    repeating the sequence until all the mice are eaten. She
    encounters two problems however: each time she eats a mouse her
    velocity reduces (due to her increased mass) by a constant
    multiplicative factor, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>. That is, if her velocity is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> before eating a mouse,
    then after eating the mouse her velocity is <span class="tex2jax_process">$v\cdot m$</span>. Also, if she doesn’t reach
    a mouse before it ducks underground, she won’t be able to eat
    it. But she can eat a mouse if she reaches it precisely at the
    time it ducks underground.</p>
<p>Since all cats are efficient by nature, help Cartesian Cat
    determine what her minimum initial velocity must be if she
    hopes to eat all of the mice. Assume that she eats the mice in
    an optimal order.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single positive integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 15$</span>), representing the
    number of mice. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines describes a mouse given as
    three space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>. This indicates that a mouse is
    located at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span> and
    will duck underground at <span class="tex2jax_process">$t =
    s$</span> seconds. The values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> are in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-1\, 000, 1\, 000]$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1,10\, 000]$</span>. No two mice are at the
    same location. The last line of input contains a single
    floating-point number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, specified to two decimal places,
    in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0.75,
    0.99]$</span>, representing the multiplicative factor by which
    the cat slows down after eating a single mouse.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum initial velocity (in units per second)
    necessary for Cartesian Cat to allow her to eat all of the
    mice, given that she eats them in the optimal order. Your
    answer should be correct within a relative or absolute error of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span>.</p>
