<p>Now one’s goose is cooked and the raw carrots are
    smoked!</p>
<p>Per-Magnus’ boss stormed into his office and complained
    about the addition program you had written for him previously.
    It can only add <em>two</em> numbers, which is of course
    completely unusable! How could you even come up with such a
    silly idea?</p>
<p>Fix your program posthaste, so that it instead sums up
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers for a given
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 10$</span>), the number of integers your program
    should add.</p>
<p>The next line contains the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers to add, each between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer – the sum of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers from the input.</p>
