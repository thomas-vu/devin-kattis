<div class="problembody">
<p>A set of gears is installed on the plane. You are given the
    center coordinate and radius of each gear, which are all
    integer-valued. For a given source and target gear, indicate
    what happens to the target gear if you attempt to turn the
    source gear. Possibilities are:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The source gear cannot move, because it would drive some
        gear in the arrangement to turn in both directions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The source gear can move, but it is not connected to the
        target gear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The source gear turns the target gear, at a certain
        ratio</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the source gear cannot move, give this result, even if
    the source and target gears are not connected.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that
    your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The
    first line of input contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 1000$</span>), the total number of gears. Following
    this will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines,
    one per gear, containing three integers: the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x, y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\, 000 \le x, y \le 10\, 000$</span>) and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le r \le 10\, 000$</span>) values for the
    gear, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> is the
    position of the axle of the gear, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is its radius. Assume that the
    teeth of the gears are properly designed, and accounted for in
    the radius, so that any gear will mesh with any other gear if
    (and only if) they are tangent to each other. The gears will
    never overlap. The source gear is the first gear, the target
    gear is the last gear specified.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line, with the following content, based on
    the result:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">-1</tt> if the source gear cannot
        move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">0</tt> if the source gear can move
        but is not connected to the target.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">a b</tt> if the source gear moves
        the target gear, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> are two space-separated
        integers, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a:b$</span> is
        the ratio of source gear revolutions to target gear
        revolutions reduced to its lowest form (i.e. they have no
        common factor other than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>).</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is always
            positive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the target turns in the same direction as the
            source, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> is
            positive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the target turns in the opposite direction as the
            source, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> is
            negative.</p>
</li>
</ul>
