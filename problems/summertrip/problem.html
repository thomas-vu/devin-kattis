<p>Leo has started a job in a travel agency. His first task is
    to organize a summer trip to an exotic overseas city. During
    the summer season, events of various types take place in the
    city: sports matches, concerts, beach parties, and many others.
    At any given time, there is exactly one event taking place.
    Events of any particular type may take place more than once
    during the season. The itinerary of events that Leo offers to
    his clients cannot be chosen arbitrarily; the company requires
    them to form a so-called “good itinerary.” A good itinerary is
    a consecutive sequence of at least two events in the summer
    season, where the first and last events are of different types,
    and they are both unique among all event types during the
    sequence. For example, if the first event in a good itinerary
    is a beach party, none of the other events during the itinerary
    can also be a beach party. There are no other restrictions on
    the event types in the sequence of a good itinerary.</p>
<p>Before he starts organizing the trip, Leo wants to know the
    total number of good itineraries that are possible given a
    calendar of events that will take place over the summer
    season.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one line with a string describing the
    sequence of event types in the summer season. All characters
    are lowercase English letters (<tt class="ttfamily">’a’</tt> –
    <tt class="ttfamily">’z’</tt>), with different letters
    represent different types of events. Character <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> of the string encodes the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th event of the summer.
    There are no blanks or spaces in the string.</p>
<p>The length of the input string is at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the number of good itineraries that exist for the
    given summer season.</p>
