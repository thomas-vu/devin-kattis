<p>Dr. Ellie Arroway has established contact with an
    extraterrestrial civilization. However, all efforts to decode
    their messages have failed so far because, as luck would have
    it, they have stumbled upon a race of stuttering aliens! Her
    team has found out that, in every long enough message, the most
    important words appear repeated a certain number of times as a
    sequence of consecutive characters, even in the middle of other
    words. Furthermore, sometimes they use contractions in an
    obscure manner. For example, if they need to say <em>bab</em>
    twice, they might just send the message <em>babab</em>, which
    has been abbreviated because the second <em>b</em> of the first
    word can be reused as the first <em>b</em> of the second
    one.</p>
<p>Thus, the message contains possibly overlapping repetitions
    of the same words over and over again. As a result, Ellie turns
    to you, S.R. Hadden, for help in identifying the gist of the
    message.</p>
<p>Given an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>,
    and a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>,
    representing the message, your task is to find the longest
    substring of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> that
    appears at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    times. For example, in the message
    <em>baaaababababbababbab</em>, the length-5 word <em>babab</em>
    is contained 3 times, namely at positions 5, 7 and 12 (where
    indices start at zero). No substring appearing 3 or more times
    is longer (see the first example from the sample input). On the
    other hand, no substring appears 11 times or more (see example
    2).</p>
<p>In case there are several solutions, the substring with the
    rightmost occurrence is preferred (see example 3).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains several test cases. Each test case
    consists of a line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$m
    \geq 1$</span>), the minimum number of repetitions, followed by
    a line containing a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> of length between <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$40\, 000$</span>, inclusive. All characters
    in <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> are lowercase
    characters from “a” to “z”. The last test case is denoted by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m = 0$</span> and must not be
    processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print one line of output for each test case. If there is no
    solution, output <tt class="ttfamily">none</tt>; otherwise,
    print two integers in a line, separated by a space. The first
    integer denotes the maximum length of a substring appearing at
    least <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> times; the
    second integer gives the rightmost starting position of this
    substring.</p>
