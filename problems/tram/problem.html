        A tram with a very low unusefulness. Maybe Lund’s tram line
        will be as appreciated as Istanbul’s, one day.

</div>It is 1815 and the politicians in Lund have just decided
    to build a tram line in Lund. Oh, sorry. That was wrong, let’s
    start over. It is 2015 and the politicians in Lund have just
    decided to build a tram line in Lund.<br/>
<br/>
    The politicians have already decided that the tram line should
    run from south-east to north-west. In order not to cause too
    many complaints from the citizens, they want to make the line
    as useful as possible. Therefore they want to minimize the
    total unusefulness of the tram.<br/>
<br/>
    The <em>unusefulness</em> for citizen <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is equal to the square of the
    closest distance from the citizen’s home to the tram line. The
    total unusefulness of the tram is the sum of all citizens’
    unusefulnesses.<br/>
<br/>
    Given the coordinates of each citizen’s home, determine the
    value <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> minimizing the
    total unusefulnes, where the equation of the tram line is given
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$y=x+a$</span>.
    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N\leq 10^5$</span>, the number of
    citizens in Lund. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, with two space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i,y_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$|x_ i|,|y_ i|\leq
    10^6$</span>), the coordinates of citizen <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’s home.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output consists of a single number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, minimizing the total
    unusefulness. An answer will be accepted if it is within an
    absolute or relative error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span>.</p>
