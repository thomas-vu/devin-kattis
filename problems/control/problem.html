<p>You are the boss of <span class="scshape">ACM</span>
    (Association for Control over Minds), an upstanding company
    with a single goal of world domination.</p>
<p>Yesterday, you woke up, and saw that the weather was clear,
    and the birds were singing. “Another day, another world
    domination plan”, you sang to yourself as you devised your next
    world domination plan involving the illusory mind control
    potions.</p>
<p>There’s only one insignificant problem you have to solve
    before you can execute this perfection of a plan: you don’t
    know the correct recipe for the mind control potion. You asked
    the local Panda-breed brewmaster for the recipe, but
    unfortunately he didn’t know either. Instead, he gave you the
    mysterious tome titled <span class="scshape">The Root of all
    Evil</span> (written by Halim the White). You read the evil
    book under candle light, and wrote down all the potion recipes
    contained inside the book. “One of them must be the formula for
    the mind control potion, I’m sure of it!”, you said to
    yourself. You numbered these recipes from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. “I just need to try concocting
    all of these recipes!”, you hummed to yourself.</p>
<p>Today, you woke up, and saw that the weather was clear,
    and…, anyway. You have purchased all the utensils and
    ingredients from the local grocery — onion, carrot, broom,
    vials, cauldrons, bat wings, …, all common grocery items. Now,
    you are ready to begin your experiments, but then you notice
    that some of the recipes share common ingredients!
    Unfortunately, you only bought one of each ingredient with you.
    “Oh no! What should I do now?!”, you panicked.</p>
<p>“I’ll just create some of the potions today, and do the
    remaining ones later.”, you resolved. You consider all your
    recipes one by one in order by their number from recipe
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through recipe
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. For each recipe, if
    you are not able to concoct this potion (explained in the next
    paragraph), you skip this recipe, and consider the next one, if
    any. Otherwise, even though it may cause some of the next
    potions to no longer be concoctable, you concoct this recipe.
    Thus, whether to concoct a potion is not a choice. It’s simply
    determined by whether it is possible or not to do so when you
    consider the potion.</p>
<p>In order to concoct a potion, you first prepare a new empty
    cauldron (you managed to procure an infinite number of
    cauldrons from the grocery store). Then, you combine all of the
    ingredients required for this potion and nothing else in this
    cauldron (that is, the cauldron cannot contain any ingredients
    not listed in the recipe). For the ingredients that have not
    been used for any of the previous potions that you’ve decided
    to concoct, you can simply put it into this cauldron. You can
    also pour the entire content of the cauldron used for one of
    your previous concoctions into this cauldron, thus mixing in
    all of the ingredients contained inside the cauldron (since you
    pour all of the content of the cauldron, this previous
    concoction can no longer be used for any of your next
    concoctions). Finally, you stir this cauldron with your broom
    and take a vial of the concoction to test on your minions
    later. The remaining concoction remains in this cauldron, and
    can be poured into another cauldron later.</p>
<p>“What is the number of recipes you will concoct this way
    today?”, you asked yourself.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a non-negative integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 200\, 000$</span>, giving the
    total number of recipes you have. Thereafter follow
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line describes
    recipe number <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. Each of
    these lines is a single space separated list of integers. Each
    of these lines begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M$</span>, denoting the number of
    ingredients required to make this recipe. Then, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> integers follow, describing the
    required ingredients. The ingredients are identified by
    integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$500\, 000$</span>, inclusively,
    with different integers denoting different ingredients. For
    each recipe, all of its ingredients will be distinct. The sum
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> over all recipes
    will be no greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$500\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the number of recipes you will concoct.</p>
<h3>Sample Data Explanation</h3>
<p>In the first example, the first potion can be concocted,
    since both ingredients were not used so far. Thus, you will
    concoct this potion. The second potion will also be concocted
    for the same reason. The third potion cannot be concocted,
    since ingredient <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is no
    longer present, and is inside a cauldron mixed with another
    ingredient not present in the recipe. The fourth potion can be
    concocted by pouring the content of the cauldrons used for the
    first and second concoctions, and then adding ingredient
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, which has remained
    unused so far. The last potion cannot be concocted, since the
    content of the cauldron for the first potion has all been
    poured when making the fourth potion and thus is now mixed with
    other ingredients not present in the recipe.</p>
<p>For the second example, since the first potion can be
    concocted, it has to be concocted. Thus, the second and third
    potions can no longer be concocted.</p>
