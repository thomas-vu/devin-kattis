<p>First Orchard is a cooperative game for children 2 years and
    up. In this simple game, the players pick colored fruits from
    trees in an orchard and place them into a basket. To make the
    game more interesting, a raven tries to reach the orchard to
    steal the fruits. If the players are successful in moving all
    fruits into the basket before the raven can get to the orchard,
    they’ll win. If the raven gets there first, the players
    lose!</p>
<p>Your task is to determine the probability with which the
    players will win!</p>
<p>The game is played as follows. There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> trees in the orchard, each bearing
    a different type of fruit: red apples, green apples, blue
    plums, and yellow pears. The raven tries to reach the orchard
    through a pathway containing one or more steps.</p>
<p>At each turn, the players roll a six-sided die. Four of the
    faces show a color (red, green, yellow, blue), the fifth face
    shows a fruit basket, and the sixth face shows a raven. All six
    faces can appear with equal probability.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><em>Red</em>, <em>Green</em>, <em>Yellow</em>,
        <em>Blue</em>. In these cases, a fruit with the
        corresponding color is placed into the basket, provided the
        tree corresponding to this color still has any fruits left
        to pick. Otherwise, the players move on to the next
        turn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Fruit Basket</em>. If the players roll the ’basket’
        face, they will pick a fruit from the tree that has the
        largest number of fruits left. If there are multiple such
        trees with the same number of fruits, any of the trees can
        be chosen.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Raven</em>. If the ’raven’ face appears on the die,
        then the raven moves one step closer towards the
        orchard.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The game is over if either the players have picked all
    fruits, or if the raven reaches the orchard, whichever happens
    first. If the raven reaches the orchard before the players have
    placed all fruits into the basket, the players lose.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case with a single line
    of input. The input contains five integer numbers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>. The values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$R, G, B$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> are the number of red, green,
    blue, and yellow fruits initially on each tree, respectively,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> denotes the number
    of steps on the raven’s pathway. Since the game is intended for
    young children, there will be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> fruits of each color: <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le R, G, B, Y \le 4$</span>. There will
    be at least one fruit overall: <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; R + G + B + Y$</span>. The raven will require at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> steps: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le S \le 8$</span>. The number of steps
    is equal to the number of times the raven must appear on the
    die for the players to lose.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the probability that the players will win as a
    floating point number. The absolute error of your result should
    be less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span>.</p>
