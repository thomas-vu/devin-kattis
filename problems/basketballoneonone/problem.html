<p>Alice and Barbara played some friendly games of one-on-one
    basketball after work, and you agreed to help them keep score.
    The rules of the game were simple:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Each successful shot by a player earns them either one
        or two points;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first player to eleven points wins, with one
        exception;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the score is tied <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, the previous rule is
        replaced by a “win by 2” rule: the first player to lead the
        other by at least two points wins.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So for example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> are possible final scores (but
    not <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span>).</p>
<p>Whenever Alice or Barbara scored points, you jotted down an
    <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>
    (indicating a score by Alice or by Barbara) followed by a
    <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">2</tt> (the
    number of points scored). You have some records of the games
    Alice and Barbara played in this format, but do not remember
    who won each game. Can you reconstruct the winner from the game
    record?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line with no more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> characters: the
    record of one game. The record consists of single letters
    (either <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>) alternating with single numbers (either
    <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">2</tt>),
    and includes no spaces or other extraneous characters. Each
    record will be a correct scoring history of a single completed
    game, played under the rules described above.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single character, either <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>
    or <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>: the winner of the recorded
    game.</p>
