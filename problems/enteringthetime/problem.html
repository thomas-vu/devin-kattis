</div>Arghs! Yet again, all the clocks in Petra’s home show the
    wrong time due to a power outage that occurred while she was
    sleeping. This means she has to spend her day resetting all the
    clocks to the correct time. Now, you might not consider this a
    big deal. After all, how many clocks does any single household
    really have? Well, Petra just so happens to be a collector of
    clocks. She literally has hundreds of clocks – and that is just
    in her bedroom! Thus, it is understandable that she does not
    look forward to all this resetting.

    <p>You, as her friend, would prefer if she did not need to
    spend her entire day resetting all her clocks. Especially since
    this means she would not have any time to play with you! If
    only you could construct some automated way of entering the
    correct time into all the clocks, perhaps through some kind of
    computer code...</p>
<p>A-ha, of course! You can write a program to determine how to
    set the correct time as quickly as possible!</p>
<p>Each clock has a display of <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> digits: two are used to display
    the hour (between <tt class="ttfamily">00</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">23</tt>), and two are used to display the minute
    (between <tt class="ttfamily">00</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">59</tt>). The time can be changed by selecting a
    digit and either decreasing or increasing by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Decreasing a digit that is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, it is turned into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, and increasing a
    digit <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> turns it into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. However, the clock
    can not display invalid times. This means that at any given
    time, the hour must be between <tt class="ttfamily">00</tt> and
    <tt class="ttfamily">23</tt> and the minute between <tt class="ttfamily">00</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">59</tt>.</p>
<p>Write a program that, given the original time of a clock and
    the current time, determines how to set the clock
    correctly.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with the time that the clock is currently set
        to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with the current time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each time has the format <tt class="ttfamily">hh:mm</tt>,
    where <tt class="ttfamily">hh</tt> is a two-digit number
    between <tt class="ttfamily">00</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">23</tt>, and <tt class="ttfamily">mm</tt> is a
    two-digit number between <tt class="ttfamily">00</tt> and
    <tt class="ttfamily">59</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first line contains the number of different times seen
    on the clock when setting it correctly. Then for each time
    output it on the same format as above <tt class="ttfamily">hh:mm</tt> on a separate line. Include both the
    original time and the final time.</p>
