<div class="problembody">
<p><em>In order to understand this problem, you need to read
    the “Association for Cool Machineries (Part 1)”
    problem.</em></p>
<p>You are the boss of <span class="scshape">ACM</span>
    (Association for Cool Machineries), an upstanding company with
    a single goal of world domination.</p>
<p>Today, after being convinced by the scientific committee of
    <span class="scshape">ACM</span>, you learned that GL-bot
    (shorthand for Giant Laser Robot) is apparently not sapient.
    Although you still find it difficult to believe that GL-bot is
    not sapient, yet the scientific committee’s argument is
    flawless: the movement of GL-bot is too regular for it to
    originate from free will. However, maybe, if GL-bot is
    programmed using a particular string and placed on a particular
    grid, the pattern may be too hard for the scientific committee
    to notice! This way, it is much harder for them to prove that
    GL-bot is not sapient, and thus, GL-bot might be labeled as
    sapient by the scientific committee! Find one such
    configuration.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>This problem has no input (the input will be empty).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Write a valid input for the <i class="itshape">“Association
    for Cool Machineries (Part 1)”</i> problem such that when a
    correct solution to that problem is given your input as its
    input, its answer is <i class="itshape">at least</i>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span>.</p>
<p>The input must adhere to all the input constraints and
    restrictions given in the <i class="itshape">“Association for
    Cool Machineries (Part 1)”</i> problem. In particular this
    means that <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> must be
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span>, inclusively.</p>
<h2>Sample Data</h2>
<p>This problem does not have any sample input and output. See
    the <i class="itshape">“Association for Cool Machineries (Part
    1)”</i> problem instead for several examples (that is, those
    sample inputs are in the correct format, but all of them are
    incorrect for this problem since the answers are less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span>).</p>
