<div class="problembody">
<p>We need to guard a set of points of interest using sentry
    robots that can not move or turn. We can position a sentry at
    any position facing either north, south, east or west. Once a
    sentry is settled, it guards the points of interest that are
    infront of it. If two or more points are in the same row or
    column a single robot can guard them all. Unfortunately, there
    are also some obstacles that the robot cannot see through.</p>
<p>From a set of points of interest and obstacles lying on a
    grid, calculate the minimum number of robots needed to guard
    all the points. In order to guard a point of interest, a robot
    must be facing the direction of this point and must not be any
    obstacles in between.</p>
<p>Given the following grid, where <tt class="ttfamily">#</tt>
    represents an obstacle and <tt class="ttfamily">*</tt> a point
    of interest, the minimum number of robots needed is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> (a possible position
    and orientation is shown using arrows for each robot). Note
    that this is not the actual input or output, just a figure.</p>

<p>For the following grid we need <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> robots because of the

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input has an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq C \leq 50$</span>) representing the number of test cases
    that follow.</p>
<p>Before each test case there is an empty line. For each case,
    the first line has 2 integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq Y, X \leq 100$</span>), representing the height and width
    of the grid. The next line has an integer that indicates the
    number of points of interest <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> lines will have the positions
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ y$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ x$</span> of the points of interest, one
    point per line (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p_ y \leq
    Y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p_ x \leq
    X$</span>). The next line has an integer that indicates the
    number of obstacles <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>.
    The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> lines
    will have the positions <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_
    y$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_ x$</span> of an
    obstacle, one per line (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq
    w_ y \leq Y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq w_ x
    \leq X$</span>). It holds that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq P + W \leq Y \cdot X$</span>, and that all positions are
    different.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case print the minimum number of robots needed
    to guard all the points of interest, one per line.</p>
