<p>Mirko and Slavko are playing a new game, “Trojke” (Triplets,
    in English). First they use a chalk to draw an <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \times N$</span> square grid on the road.
    Then they write letters into some of the squares. No letter is
    written more than once in the grid.</p>
<p>The game consists of trying to find three letters on a line
    as fast as possible. Three letters are considered to be on the
    same line if there is a line going through the centre of each
    of the three squares.</p>
<p>After a while it gets harder to find new triplets. Mirko and
    Slavko need a program that counts all the triplets, so that
    they know if the game is over or they need to search
    further.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \le N \le 100$</span>), the dimension of the grid.</p>
<p>Each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    following lines contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> characters describing the grid –
    uppercase letters and the character <tt class="ttfamily">’.’</tt> which marks an empty square.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of triples on a single line.</p>
