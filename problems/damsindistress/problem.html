      </div>
</div>Freyr, the god of prosperity, rain and the harvest, is
    having a lot of trouble these days. The giants are once again
    trying to invade Midgard, and have built a war camp at the
    bottom of the many valleys leading to Midgard. Now Freyr needs
    to wash that camp away, so a great victory feast can be held.
    Being at the bottom of the valley, any rain in the region can
    make its way through rivers and streams to the bottom of the
    valley and contribute to the glorious flooding of the giants.
    However, beavers and industrious humans have built dams
    throughout the river system, and these act as buffers that can
    hold some amount of water. But, on the flip side, once a dam is
    filled up to its capacity, it will break and all of the water
    stored there (as well as any further water added) will be
    released downstream.
    <p>Freyr, being the god of rain, knows exactly how much water
    is needed to wash the war camp away, and for each dam knows its
    exact capacity and how much water is currently stored there.
    Freyr, also being the god of prosperity and harvest, has better
    things to do than making it rain everywhere all day, so Freyr
    decides to only make it rain at a single place (either a dam,
    or the war camp), and to make it rain as little as possible in
    that place. What is the minimum amount of rain that Freyr needs
    to make to wash away the giants war camp, provided he carefully
    chooses the best location for the rain?</p>
<p>The network of dams and the war camp form a rooted tree,
    where the war camp is the root and the parent of a dam is the
    location (either another dam, or the war camp) immediately
    downstream of the dam. See FigureÂ 1 for an example.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: Illustration of Sample Input 1. In this
          case Freyr only has to make <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> units of rain at the
          left-most dam in order to make it break and send
          <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> units of water
          downstream, which then ultimately results in <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> units of rain reaching the
          war camp, well exceeding the <span class="tex2jax_process">$75$</span> units of water needed to
          flood the camp.

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le w \le 10^9$</span>), the number of
    dams and the amount of water needed to wash away the war camp,
    respectively. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, describing the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> dams. The dams are numbered from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th line contains
    three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le d_ i &lt; i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le c_ i \le 10^9$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le u_ i &lt; c_ i$</span>), where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span> is the number of
    the dam immediately downstream of dam <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (or <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> if the war camp is immediately
    downstream of dam <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>),
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span> is the maximum
    capacity of dam <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_ i$</span> is the current
    amount of water in dam <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum amount of rain Freyr needs to make at one
    location, which will result in at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> water reaching the war camp.</p>
