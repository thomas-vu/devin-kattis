<p>Once there was a great general Paul who issued the following
    warning:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<em>Suppose aliens invade the earth and threaten to
      obliterate it in a year’s time unless human beings can find
      the Ramsey number for red five and blue five. We could
      marshal the world’s best minds and fastest computers, and
      within a year we could probably calculate the value. If the
      aliens demanded the Ramsey number for red six and blue six,
      however, we would have no choice but to launch a preemptive
      attack.</em>
</blockquote>
<p>However this time, when the aliens come, they only write
    down a single line of XOR equation in the form of <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> <tt class="tt">xor</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$b~ =~
    c$</span> (here “<tt class="tt">xor</tt>” denotes the bitwise
    XOR operator) with some digits hidden in question marks. The
    aliens ask humans to calculate the number of ways that this
    equation can be satisfied. For example, two ways to satisfy
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$?3$</span> <tt class="tt">xor</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$1?~ =~
    ?$</span> are <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span> <tt class="tt">xor</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$10~ =~
    7$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span> <tt class="tt">xor</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$13~ =~
    0$</span>. Obviously, the aliens will not be happy if humans
    count it wrong.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input has a single line that contains the XOR equation
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> <tt class="tt">xor</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$b~ =~
    c$</span> with some digits replaced by question marks. A single
    space is used to separate the integers, the string “<tt class="tt">xor</tt>”, and the equals sign. The three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> are non-negative and written in
    base-<span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> without leading
    zeroes. No integer has more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> digits. There is at least one and
    at most ten question marks in the equation.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of ways in which the XOR equation can be
    satisfied after all the question marks are replaced by
    digits.</p>
