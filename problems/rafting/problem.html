<div class="problembody">
<p>You have been hired by a big theme park to design a new
    attraction: a white water rafting ride. You already designed
    the track; it is a round trip that is described by an inner and
    an outer polygon. The space in between the two polygons is the
    track.</p>
<p>You still need to design the rafts, however. It has been
    decided that they should be circular, so that they can spin
    freely along the track and increase the fun and excitement of
    the ride. Besides that, they should be as big as possible to
    fit the maximum number of people, but they canâ€™t be too big,
    for otherwise they would get stuck somewhere on the track.</p>
<p>What is the maximum radius of the rafts so that they can
    complete the track?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of
    testcases, at most 100. After that per testcase:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3\le n_ i\le 100$</span>): the number of
        points of the inner polygon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ i$</span> lines with
        two integers each: the coordinates of the points of the
        inner polygon in consecutive order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ o$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3\le n_ o\le 100$</span>): the number of
        points of the outer polygon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ o$</span> lines with
        two integers each: the coordinates of the points of the
        outer polygon in consecutive order.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All coordinates have absolute value no larger than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>. The points of
    the polygons can be given in either clockwise or
    counterclockwise order and the two polygons do not intersect or
    touch themselves or each other. The outer polygon encloses the
    inner polygon.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per testcase:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with a floating point number: the maximal
        radius of the white water rafts. This number must have a
        relative or absolute error less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
</li>
