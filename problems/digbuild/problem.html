<p>Most of us like playing video games. Benni prefers to play
    the video game <em>Digbuild</em>. <em>Digbuild</em> is
    primarily about surviving for as long as possible. In the game
    almost everything is possible. You can climb mountains, build
    castles, and fish, just to name a few options. The gameworld
    consists of large cubes, all the same size, whose corners are
    always in integral coordinates in three dimensional space. The
    player can both break these cubes (or blocks) and place blocks
    next to ones already there. There are also other items in the
    gameworld, auxiliary to these blocks. A few examples would be
    beds to sleep on, frames for photographs, and torches to light
    the world.</p>
<p>Benni isn’t a fan of building. He’d much rather dig tunnels
    in the ground. Benni always digs his tunnels horizontally and
    parallel to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis
    of the gameworld. They are also always <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> blocks high and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> blocks wide. Benni has just
    finished digging an <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    block long tunnel and decided to go get a glass of water. When
    he sits down again to play some more he notices the tunnels are
    rather poorly lit. He realizes he has to place some torches on
    the floor of his tunnel to light the up. Benni is rather
    insistent on his tunnel not becoming ugly so he has to places
    the torches strategically. Benni considers his tunnel to be
    ugly if two blocks sharing a face both hold a torch.</p>
<p>In <em>Digbuild</em> you can only place one torch per block.
    Benni is so against his tunnel being ugly he’d rather have them
    unlit completely (i.e. not placing a torch is not considered
    ugly).</p>
<p>In how many different ways can Benni place the torches such
    that his tunnel doesn’t become ugly? Since this number may be
    rather large you are asked to find the answer <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mod 10^9 + 7$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line in the input contains the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq
    10^{18}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The only line in the output should contain the number of
    non-ugly torch arrangements in an <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> block long tunnel, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mod 10^9 + 7$</span>.</p>
