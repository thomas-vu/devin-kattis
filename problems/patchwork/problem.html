<p>Adam’s grandmother has a birthday coming up and he wants to
    make her a beautiful patchwork quilt as a present. He has
    created a collection of patch designs that he will sew onto the
    quilt. However, he is having trouble deciding exactly where to
    place his patches. His current procedure is to sew on all
    patches in a given configuration, determine if he likes the way
    it looks, and cut them all off if he doesn’t. This is highly
    inefficient and Adam is running out of time.</p>
<p>Adam starts with a rectangular white cloth to be used as the
    base for his quilt and has a collection of possible patch
    types. Each patch type is a rectangular piece of cloth with a
    specified design. Fortunately, Adam has come prepared and he
    has an unlimited quantity of every patch type. Adam has asked
    you to write a program to determine what the cloth will look
    like after sewing the patches on in a specific order and in
    specific locations. Note that Adam cuts off excess fabric that
    hangs off the edge of the quilt’s base so your program should
    do the same.</p>
<p>Help Adam by writing a program to output the completed
    quilt.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R, C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq R, C \leq 100$</span>) giving the
    dimensions of the quilt. Initially, this quilt is white and is
    represented by a grid with <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rows and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> columns where each entry is the
    character ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’ (a period) representing
    white.</p>
<p>The second line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 100$</span>), which is the number of different
    patch types. The following describes the patches:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line in the description of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th patch type consists of two
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i, c_ i$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq r_ i, c_ i \leq
        100$</span>) giving the number of rows <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i$</span> and columns <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span> in this patch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i$</span> lines
        follow, each containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_
        i$</span> non-whitespace ASCII characters which describes
        the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th patch
        type.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The next line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq M \leq 100$</span>), which is the number of patches that
    Adam wishes to sew onto the quilt.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines of
    input describe the placement and types of these patches. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>th such line contains
    three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_ j$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq q_ j &lt; R$</span>),
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq t_ j &lt; C$</span>), and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p_ j \leq N$</span>). This means that
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ j$</span>th patch is sewn
    onto the quilt with its top-left corner on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_ j, t_ j$</span> row/column position of
    the quilt. This list is given in the order that they are sewn
    onto the quilt.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the completed quilt. That is, display <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rows and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> columns of ASCII characters where
    each position is the pattern of the quilt after sewing on the
    given patches whilst removing excess fabric.</p>
