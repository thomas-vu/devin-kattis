</div>The (simple) continued fraction representation of a real
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is an
    expression obtained by an iterative process of representing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> as the sum of its
    integer part and the reciprocal of another number, then writing
    this other number as the sum of its integer part and another
    reciprocal, and so on. In other words, a continued fraction
    representation of <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is
    of the form <span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{equation*} r =
    a_0 + \cfrac {1}{a_1 + \cfrac {1}{a_2 + \cfrac {1}{a_3+\dots
    }}} \end{equation*}</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots
    $</span> are integers and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1,
    a_2, \dots &gt; 0$</span>. We call the <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>-values <i class="itshape">partial quotients</i>. For example, in the continued
    fraction representation of <span class="tex2jax_process">$5.4$</span>, the partial quotients are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_0 = 5, a_1 = 2, a_2 =
    2$</span>. This representation of a real number has several
    applications in theory and practice. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is a rational number, the partial
    quotients are eventually all zero, so we only need to consider
    a finite number of partial quotients.</p>
<p>Given two rational numbers in continued fraction
    representation, your task is to perform the four elementary
    arithmetic operations on these numbers and display the results
    in continued fraction representation.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The test case
    consists of three lines. The first line contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_2$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n_ i \le 9$</span> is the number of
    partial quotients of rational number <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i$</span> for <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i \le 2$</span>. The second line
    contains the partial quotients of <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_1$</span> and the third line contains the
    partial quotients of <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_2$</span>. The absolute values of the
    quotients are not more than 10Â and you may assume that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_1 &gt; r_2 &gt; 0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the partial quotients of the continued fraction
    representations of <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_1+r_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_1-r_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_1 \times r_2$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_1 / r_2$</span>, in order, each in a line.
    Consecutive partial quotients on each line are separated by a
    single space. Do not print any trailing zero partial
    quotients.</p>
