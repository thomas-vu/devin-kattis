</div>Mia is a dice game for two players. Each roll consist of
    two dice. Mia involves bluffing about what a player has rolled,
    but in this problem we focus only on its scoring rules. Unlike
    most other dice games, the score of a roll is not simply the
    sum of the dice.

    <p>Instead, a roll is scored as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Mia (<span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> or
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$21$</span>) is always
        highest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next come doubles (<span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$22$</span>, and so on). Ties are broken
        by value, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$66$</span>
        being highest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All remaining rolls are sorted such that the highest
        number comes first, which results in a two-digit number.
        The value of the roll is the value of that number, e.g.
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> becomes <span class="tex2jax_process">$43$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> each roll two dice.
    You are asked to compute the odds that player 1 will win given
    partial knowledge of both rolls.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will contain multiple, different test cases. Each
    test case contains on a single line four symbols <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_0 \ s_1 \ r_0 \ r_1$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_0 \ s_1$</span> represent the
    dice rolled by player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_0 \ r_1$</span> represents
    the dice rolled by player <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>. A ‘<tt class="ttfamily">*</tt>’
    represents that the value is not known, otherwise a digit
    represents the value of the dice. The input will be terminated
    by a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>
    zeros.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case output the odds that player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> will win. If the odds are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Otherwise, output the odds in the
    form <span class="tex2jax_process">$a/b$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> represent the nominator and
    denominator of a reduced fraction (i.e., in lowest terms).</p>
<h2>Sample Output Explanation</h2>
<p>For <tt class="ttfamily">* * 1 2</tt>, the best player
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> can do is tie, so his
    chance of winning is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.
    For <tt class="ttfamily">1 2 * *</tt>, player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> wins unless player <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> rolls a Mia, which happens
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> out of <span class="tex2jax_process">$18$</span> times. For <tt class="ttfamily">1
    2 1 3</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">3 1 2 1</tt>, and <tt class="ttfamily">6 6 6 6</tt> the result is already known. For
    <tt class="ttfamily">* 2 2 2</tt>, player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> wins only if she rolls a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. For <tt class="ttfamily">* 2 * 6</tt>, player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> wins if he rolls a <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. If he rolls a <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, he wins with probability
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5/6$</span>. He loses if he
    rolls a <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>. If he rolls a <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> he wins only if player
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> rolls a <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Thus, his chance of winning is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/6 + 5/6 \cdot 1/6 + 1/6 \cdot
    1/6 = 12/36 = 1/3$</span>. When no dice are known, Player
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> will win in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$615$</span> of all possible
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 296$</span> outcomes. Player
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> will lose in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$615$</span> cases, and there are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$66$</span> possible ties. Thus,
    her chance of winning is <span class="tex2jax_process">$615/1296 = 205/432$</span>.</p>
