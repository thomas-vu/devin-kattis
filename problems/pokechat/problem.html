<p>The year is 2011, and you and your friend each got a copy of
    the newly released Pokemon Diamond and Pearl games. You enjoy
    playing the game together, but you can’t always be together and
    talk while you’re playing because your mom makes you come home
    after dark. This would be fine, except that the in-game chat
    functionality only allows for predetermined messages and you
    want to talk freely with your friend while you play. In order
    to be able to communicate any message, you and your friend come
    up with a simple code to convey characters to each other by
    displaying Pokemon using the game’s trading feature.</p>

<p>The code takes advantage of an encoding string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, which contains a series of unique
    characters, which you and your friend decided on in advance and
    both have a copy of. By displaying a Pokemon of id <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, your friend (or you) is signaling
    that they intend to communicate the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-th character of the encoding
    string that you are both using as a code. By displaying
    specific Pokemon in a certain order, with one Pokemon per
    character in the message you want to send, you and your friend
    can then take turns communicating full messages of your own
    choices. For example, with an encoding string of <i class="itshape">abr</i>, the id number ordering of <span class="tex2jax_process">$001$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$002$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$003$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$001$</span> represent <i class="itshape">abra</i>. Given the encoding string, and a string of
    Pokemon ids that your friend has displayed in the order given
    by the string, determine the corresponding message that your
    friend has sent to you.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>A string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> of unique
    characters representing the encoding string, where each
    character is a printable ASCII character (note that the
    whitespace character could be in <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>). It is guaranteed that the length
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> will be less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>.</p>
<p>A non-empty string of <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-digit Pokemon id numbers (zeros
    will be added in front of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> digit id numbers) of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; l &lt; 1000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> is divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. It is guaranteed that each
    Pokemon id number will be less than or equal to the length of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A non-empty message consisting only of characters found in
    the encoding string.</p>
