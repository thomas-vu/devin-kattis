<p>Soundex coding groups together words that appear to sound
    alike based on their spelling. For example, “can” and “khawn”,
    “con” and “gone” would be equivalent under Soundex coding.</p>
<p>Soundex coding involves translating each word into a series
    of digits in which each digit represents a letter:</p>
<pre>
      1 represents B, F, P, or V
      2 represents C, G, J, K, Q, S, X,  or Z
      3 represents D or T
      4 represents L
      5 represents M or N
      6 represents R
</pre>
<p>The letters A, E, I, O, U, H, W, and Y are not represented
    in Soundex coding, and repeated letters with the same code
    digit are represented by a single instance of that digit. Words
    with the same Soundex coding are considered equivalent.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each line of input contains a single word, all upper case,
    less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> letters
    long. There are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\,
    000$</span> lines of input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line of input, produce a line of output giving its
    Soundex code.</p>
