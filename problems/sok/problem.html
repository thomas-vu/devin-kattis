<p>Mirko and Slavko bought a few liters of orange, apple and
    pineapple juice. They are now whipping up a non alcoholic
    cocktail following a recipe they found on the Internet. Sadly,
    they figured out too late that not only you should use recipes
    when making cocktails, you should also use them when planning
    how much juice to buy.</p>
<p>Write a program that will determine how much of each juice
    they will have leftover, after they make as much cocktail as
    possible, respecting the recipe.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains three integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq A, B, C \leq 500$</span>), the amount of orange, apple and
    pineapple juice they bought, in liters.</p>
<p>The second line contains three integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$I$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$J$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq I, J, K \leq 50$</span>), the ratio of orange, apple and
    pineapple juice in the cocktail.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output should contain three
    decimal numbers, the leftover amounts of each juice, in liters.
    Solutions with absolute or relative error <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span> or smaller will be
    accepted.</p>
