</div>Strings of yarn have been popular in Catland for ages.
    Which cat has not spent many a lazy afternoon bouncing around a
    ball of yarn? Lately however, strings of yarn have gotten
    competition: strings of characters. It turns out that these are
    almost as much fun as yarn, and generally much safer as well
    (so far, no cat has had to call 911 on account of any character
    string-related entanglement accidents).
    <p>Naturally, some strings are more stylish than others, and
    for cool cats it is important to engage in their string-playing
    pastime with style. The <em>meow factor</em> of a string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is the minimum number
    of operations needed to transform <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> into a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S’$</span> which contains the word “meow” as
    a substring, where an operation is one of the following
    four:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Insert an arbitrary character anywhere into the
        string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete an arbitrary character anywhere from the
        string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace any character in the string by an arbitrary
        character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Swap any two adjacent characters in the string.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Write a program to compute the meow factor of a string of
    characters.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing a string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, consisting only of
    lower-case letters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>’-‘<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>’. The length of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the meow factor of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>.</p>
