<div class="problembody">
<p>The 19th century German mathematician Hermann Minkowski
    investigated a non-Euclidian geometry, called the taxicab
    geometry. In taxicab geometry the distance between two points
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_1(x_1, y_1)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_2(x_2, y_2)$</span> is defined
    as:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ D(T_1,T_2) = \left|x_1
    - x_2\right| + \left|y_1 - y_2\right| \]</span>
<p>All other definitions are the same as in Euclidian geometry,
    including that of a circle:</p>
<p>A <b class="bfseries">circle</b> is the set of all points in
    a plane at a fixed distance (the radius) from a fixed point
    (the centre of the circle).</p>
<p>We are interested in the difference of the areas of two
    circles with radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>,
    one of which is in normal (Euclidian) geometry, and the other
    in taxicab geometry. The burden of solving this difficult
    problem has fallen onto you.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input will contain the radius
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, a positive integer
    smaller than or equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>On the first line you should output the area of a circle
    with radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> in normal
    (Euclidian) geometry. On the second line you should output the
    area of a circle with radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> in taxicab geometry.</p>
<p>Note: Outputs within <span class="tex2jax_process">$\pm
    0.0001$</span> of the official solution will be accepted.</p>
