<div class="problembody">
<p>Have you ever wondered what the average ASCII character of
    any given string is? No? Never? Really? Well, is it a character
    in the string or something else?</p>
<p>Would you do this calculation by hand with an ASCII table?
    Probably not! All modern programming languages include
    functions for converting an ASCII character to an integer, and
    to convert an integer to an ASCII character. Of course, these
    functions often also handle unicode characters as well, but
    that is not part of this problem.</p>
<p>Given a string of ASCII characters, compute the average
    character. If the average character lies between two integer
    ASCII values, return the smaller one.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The single line of input contains a single string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le |s| \le 100$</span>), which consists
    of ASCII text. All of the characters of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> will be printable ASCII, between
    ASCII <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span>
    (space:<tt class="ttfamily">‘ ’</tt>) and ASCII <span class="tex2jax_process">$126$</span> (tilde:<tt class="ttfamily">‘~’</tt>). It will <b class="bfseries">NOT</b>
    contain any control characters such as carriage returns, line
    feeds, tabs, etc. It is <b class="bfseries">NOT</b> guaranteed
    to begin, end, or even contain a non-space character.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single ASCII character, which is the average of all
    of the ASCII characters in <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>.</p>
