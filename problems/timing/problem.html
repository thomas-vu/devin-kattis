<p>A clash of galaxies is coming!</p>
<p>A galaxy ruled by the mysterious MdI is trying to annex our
    milky way, but the galactical government has plans to turn
    things round.</p>
<p>Our intelligence agency has infiltrated the enemy’s
    headquarter and gained surprising intelligence. The enemy is
    moving its units around according to a fixed scheme: for each
    fort a fraction of the units is moved to other forts in each
    time unit (the time of the flight is negligible).</p>
<p>Now the government has fixed a time when to attack. Your
    order is to compute the weak points. But as the enemy’s galaxy
    is far, far away it takes one time unit to fly there.
    Furthermore, we are also certain that the MdI will recognize
    our target and immediately start all ships which can reach our
    attacking point (via one link, regardless of its direction).
    The spy informed you that these strengths are only statistical
    values, i.e. some sort of indicator as float.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains the number of test
    cases (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq T\leq 10$</span>).
    Each test case starts with one line containing three integers
    stating the number of enemy forts <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N \leq 100$</span>), the number of
    links <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq l\leq (N-1)^2$</span>) and the time
    from now when to attack <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq t\leq 5000$</span>). The second line
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> doubles
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq u_ i\leq 1000$</span>) specifying the
    strength of the stationed troops at each fort followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> lines containing the
    links. Each link is described by two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq s_ j &lt;N$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq t_ j &lt; N$</span>) describing the
    source and the target of the link and one double <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0&lt; p_ j \leq 1$</span>), the fraction of
    units transferred from <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_
    j$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ j$</span> in
    each time unit.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the lowest indicator of the enemy galaxy with an
    absolute or relative error less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
