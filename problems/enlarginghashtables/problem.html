<p>When implementing an open addressing hash table, we can use
    many different types of collision resolution strategies. One
    such strategy is quadratic probing. If we use quadratic
    probing, it’s very important that the size of the hash table is
    a prime number. If it is a prime number and the table is less
    than half full, then we can prove that the quadratic probing
    algorithm will always be able to find an empty slot. That’s
    necessary because finding an empty slot is the way the
    algorithm knows when to stop probing. However, if the table
    size is not prime, then even if the table is much less than
    half full, the probing algorithm may probe the same slots
    repeatedly and not find any empty slots.</p>
<p>Of course, even if the table size is prime, when the table
    gets half-full, the table size needs to increase to a larger
    prime. Our strategy for increasing the table size is to pick
    the smallest prime number larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> was the old table size.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input is a sequence of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> table sizes, one per line.
    Each is given as an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le n &lt; 2^{30}$</span>. The end of input is indicated by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=0$</span>, which should not be
    processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the smallest prime number larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2n$</span>. Also, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> happens not to be prime, add the
    parenthetical note ‘(<span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    is not prime)’.</p>
