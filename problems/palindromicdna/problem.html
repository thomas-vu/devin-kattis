<div class="problembody">
<p>A DNA sequence is composed of a series of four possible
    nucleobases, namely Adenine, Guanine, Thymine and Cytosine; we
    will refer to each of these bases by their initial. For our
    purposes, nucleobases have an associated cyclic “order”:
    <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt> is followed by <tt class="ttfamily">G</tt>, which in turn is followed by <tt class="ttfamily">T</tt>, which is followed by <tt class="ttfamily">C</tt>, which is followed by <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt> again. State-of-the-art research in genomics
    has revealed the startling fact that many diseases are caused
    by certain subsequences of bases not forming a palindromic
    sequence! Your mission as a leading researcher at ICPC
    laboratories is to take a DNA string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and a series of subsets
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_1 , \ldots , P_ t$</span> of
    indices to characters (nucleobases) in <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, and transform <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> so that each of the restrictions
    of the resulting string to <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_1 ,
    \ldots , P_ t$</span> are palindromic. (The restriction of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> to a subset
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P = \{ i_1 , i_2 , \ldots , i_ k
    \} $</span> of indices, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq i_1 &lt; i_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; i_ k &lt; |S|$</span>, is
    the string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_{i_1} S_{i_2}
    \ldots S_{i_ k}$</span> ). It is possible to inspect any base
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> at will, but only
    three transformations can be applied to a base:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Leave it unaltered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increase it by 1 in the cyclic order of nucleobases
        (e.g. turn <tt class="ttfamily">C</tt> into <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decrease it by 1 (e.g. turn <tt class="ttfamily">T</tt>
        into <tt class="ttfamily">G</tt>).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Moreover, owing to limitations of current technology, it is
    impossible to modify two bases in consecutive positions of the
    sequence. Is our goal achievable?</p>
<p>By way of example, consider DNA sequence <tt class="ttfamily">AGTAT</tt>. Number positions starting from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, and suppose we have
    the three subsets <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_1$</span> =
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 4\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_2 = \{ 0, 1\} $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_3 = \{ 0, 2, 4\} $</span>. One solution is
    to increase the first character and decrease the last, yielding
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S = \texttt{GGTAG}$</span>. The
    restrictions of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_1$</span> , <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_3$</span> are <tt class="ttfamily">GG</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">GG</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">GTG</tt>, respectively; all of them are
    palindromic.</p>
<p>One case where no solution is possible is when the string is
    <tt class="ttfamily">CATGC</tt>, and we require the
    subsequences determined by positions <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 0, 3\} $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 3, 4\} $</span> be palindromic. Here,
    characters <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> would all need to become a
    <tt class="ttfamily">T</tt>. But this entails modifying
    consecutive characters <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, which is not
    allowed.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> test cases. The first line of
    each test case has two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 10\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq T \leq 6\, 000$</span>), the sequence length and number of
    subsets to consider. The next line contains the DNA sequence of
    length <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> , all of whose
    characters are in <tt class="ttfamily">ACGT</tt>. The subsets
    are described by the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines. Each line starts by
    “<span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span><tt class="ttfamily">:</tt>”, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq L \leq N$</span>) is the number of positions in the
    subset, and is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> distinct integers between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N - 1$</span> in increasing order. Subsets
    may overlap partially or totally.</p>
<p>A blank line separates different test cases. The input file
    is terminated by a line containing <tt class="ttfamily">0
    0</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>In a single line per test case, print <tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt> if the task is solvable and <tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt> otherwise.</p>
