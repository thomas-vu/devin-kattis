<p>After coming to college from high school, you discovered
    something absolutely tragic. The way that GPA is calculated is
    completely different than what you are used to. Apparently,
    pluses and minuses are treated very differently than they were
    before, according to the following table.</p>

<p>GPA is calculated by taking the sum of the individual grade
    points (seen in the table above) and dividing it by the number
    of courses. You have received your report card for the current
    quarter, but you’ve blocked out the pluses and minuses instead
    because you’re too scared to look, so your report card can be
    one of many different variations. For example, a report card of
    ABB could be A+ B B+, A- B- B+, or even A B B. In how many
    possible report card variations will the college grading system
    actually be better for your GPA compared to your old high
    school system? Since this number might be quite large, print
    out your answer modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9+7$</span>. Note that order matters, so
    A B B+ and A B+ B are considered two different variations of
    ABB.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with one line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, denoting the length
    of the report card (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N
    \leq 3\, 000$</span>).</p>
<p>The second line is a string of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> characters (A,B,C,D,F)
    representing the obscured report card.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The number of report cards modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9+7$</span> that would give you a
    strictly better GPA than in high school.</p>
