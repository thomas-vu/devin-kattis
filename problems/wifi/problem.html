<p>One day, the residents of Main Street got together and
    decided that they would install wireless internet on their
    street, with coverage for every house. Now they need your help
    to decide where they should place the wireless access points.
    They would like to have as strong a signal as possible in every
    house, but they have only a limited budget for purchasing
    access points. They would like to place the available access
    points so that the maximum distance between any house and the
    access point closest to it is as small as possible.</p>
<p>Main Street is a perfectly straight road. The street number
    of each house is the number of metres from the end of the
    street to the house. For example, the house at address 123 Main
    Street is exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$123$</span>
    metres from the end of the street.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer specifying the
    number of test cases and there will be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> test cases. The first line of
    each test case contains two positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of access points that
    the residents can buy, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, the number of houses on Main
    Street. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines contain the house numbers of the houses on Main Street,
    one house number on each line. There will be no more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> houses on Main
    Street, and the house numbers will be no larger than one
    million.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing one number, the
    maximum distance between any house and the access point nearest
    to it. Round the number to the nearest tenth of a metre, and
    output it with exactly one digit after the decimal point.</p>
