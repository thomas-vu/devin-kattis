<div class="problembody">
<p>Write a program which, given an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> as input, will produce a
    mathematical expression whose solution is <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. The solution is restricted to
    using exactly four <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>’s
    and exactly three of the binary operations selected from the
    set <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ *, +, -, /\} $</span>.
    The number <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> is the ONLY
    number you can use. You are not allowed to concatenate fours to
    generate other numbers, such as <span class="tex2jax_process">$44$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$444$</span>.</p>
<p>For example given <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=0$</span>, a solution is <span class="tex2jax_process">$4 * 4 - 4 * 4 = 0$</span>. Given
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=7$</span>, a solution is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4 + 4 - 4~ /~ 4 = 7$</span>.
    Division is considered truncating integer division, so that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/4$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> (instead of <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.25$</span>). Assume the usual precedence
    of operations so that <span class="tex2jax_process">$4 + 4 * 4
    = 20$</span>, not <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span>.
    Not all integer inputs have solutions using four <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>’s with the aforementioned
    restrictions (consider <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=11$</span>).</p>
<p><em>Hint: Using your forehead and some forethought should
    make an answer forthcoming. When in doubt use the
    fourth.</em></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 1\, 000$</span>, indicating
    the number of test cases that follow. Each of the next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines contain exactly
    one integer value for <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1\, 000\, 000 \leq
    n \leq 1\, 000\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case print one line of output containing
    either an equation using four <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>’s to reach the target number or
    the phrase <tt class="tt">no solution</tt>. Print the equation
    following the format of the sample output; use spaces to
    separate the numbers and symbols printed. If there is more than
    one such equation which evaluates to the target integer, print
    any one of them.</p>
