<p>FKHÍ’s continuous integration system performs many tasks.
    Ensures input data is formatted correctly, looks for typos in
    problem statements and more. After having made a reference to a
    popular movie in the last contest and spoiled an important plot
    point for those who had not seen it yet, the organisers have
    decided to add a spoiler filtering program into the integration
    system. The spoiler filtering program should analyse all text
    in the contest data files and make sure there is no text
    spoiling important plot points that people would rather not
    have spoiled. But to create such a system one needs to
    determine what text is a spoiler, so the program knows what it
    is looking for. Thus your task is to create a text file
    containing all possible spoilers.</p>
<p>All possible first words of a spoiler have been determined,
    same for all possible second words and so on. Thus the only
    task left is to generate all possible combinations of these
    words to prepare the text file.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100$</span>, the number of
    words in each spoiler. <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines follow, one for each word. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line begins with an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq 100$</span>, the
    number of options for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th word. Next these <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> words follow on the same line,
    separated by spaces. These <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> words are distinct from each
    other. All words in the input only contain English lower and
    upper case characters. Each word is at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> letter and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> letters in length.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print all possible ways to combine the words into a spoiler.
    Each spoiler should be on its own line. The spoilers are to be
    printed in ASCII-order (note that this is the default order in
    most programming languages). It is guaranteed that the output
    will contain at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span> letters.</p>
