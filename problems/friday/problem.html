</div>On the planet Htrae Friday the 13th is a lucky day. You
    are going there on the next space ship and want to calculate
    how many times it happens during a given year. Unfortunately
    they change their calendar every year. Every year starts on a
    Sunday, but other than that, they change everything. They have
    released a list of calendar specifications for the next few
    years. A calendar specification consists of the total number of
    days in the year, the number of months in the year, and the
    number of days in each of the months.<br/>
<p>Your task is to figure out how many times there will be
    Friday the 13th based on the calendar specifications.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of a single integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the number of test
    cases.<br/>
    The first line of each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases is a line with two
    space separated integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, the total number of days in the
    year and the number of months in the year respectively. The
    second line of each test case consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> space separated integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span>, the number of days
    in each month.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq
        20$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq D \leq
        1000$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d_ i \leq
        100$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$\sum (d_ i) =
        D$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the number of Friday the 13ths in
    the specified year.</p>
