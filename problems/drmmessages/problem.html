<p>DRM Encryption is a new kind of encryption. Given an
    encrypted string (which we’ll call a <em>DRM message</em>), the
    decryption process involves three steps: Divide, Rotate and
    Merge. This process is described in the following example with
    the DRM message “EWPGAJRB”:</p>
<dl class="description">
<dt>Divide</dt>
<dd>
<p>– First, divide the message in half to “EWPG” and
        “AJRB”.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Rotate</dt>
<dd>
<p>– For each half, calculate its rotation value by summing
        up the values of each character (<span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{A} = 0, \textrm{B} = 1, \ldots ,
        \textrm{Z} = 25$</span>). The rotation value of “EWPG” is
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$4 + 22 + 15 + 6 =
        47$</span>. Rotate each character in “EWPG” <span class="tex2jax_process">$47$</span> positions forward (wrapping
        from Z to A when necessary) to obtain the new string
        “ZRKB”. Following the same process on “AJRB” results in
        “BKSC”.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Merge</dt>
<dd>
<p>– The last step is to combine these new strings (“ZRKB”
        and “BKSC”) by rotating each character in the first string
        by the value of the corresponding character in the second
        string. For the first position, rotating ‘Z’ by ‘B’ means
        moving it forward 1 character, which wraps it around to
        ‘A’. Continuing this process for every character results in
        the final decrypted message, “ABCD”.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single DRM message to be decrypted. All
    characters in the string are uppercase letters and the string’s
    length is even and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\leq 15\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the decrypted DRM message.</p>
