<p>Dominos are lots of fun. Children like to stand the tiles on
    their side in long lines. When one domino falls, it knocks down
    the next one, which knocks down the one after that, all the way
    down the line. However, sometimes a domino fails to knock the
    next one down. In that case, we have to knock it down by hand
    to get the dominos falling again.</p>
<p>Your task is to determine, given the layout of some domino
    tiles, the minimum number of dominos that must be knocked down
    by hand in order for all of the dominos to fall.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer specifying the
    number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a
    line containing two integers, each no larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>. The first integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of
    domino tiles and the second integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number of lines to follow
    in the test case. The domino tiles are numbered from 1 to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Each of the following
    lines contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> indicating that if domino number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> falls, it will cause
    domino number <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> to fall
    as well.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing one integer,
    the minimum number of dominos that must be knocked over by hand
    in order for all the dominos to fall.</p>
