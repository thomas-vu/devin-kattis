        keyboard</a> by The Keyboard Waffle Iron

</div>Oh no! Joanna just spilled some syrup on her keyboard and
    now some of the keys are sticky. This causes her considerable
    frustration, as every time she presses one of the sticky keys,
    the corresponding character gets entered twice on her computer.
    <p>This could not have happened at a more inconvenient time; it
    is the start of the contest and she was just about to type in
    the solution to the first problem! Joanna does not have time to
    remove and clean every key on her keyboard, so she wonders if
    there is a way to quickly identify the sticky keys. Starting to
    panic, she quickly types some text on her keyboard and stares
    at the resulting text displayed on her screen.</p>
<p>Given the line of text that Joanna typed on her keyboard and
    the resulting text displayed on her screen, help her determine
    which keys must be sticky.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq \mathrm{length}(s) \leq 1\,
        000$</span>), the text that Joanna typed on her
        keyboard.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq \mathrm{length}(t) \leq 1\,
        000$</span>), the text displayed on Joanna’s screen as a
        result.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> consist only of
    lower-case letters (‘<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>’–‘<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>’) and spaces (‘ ’), and start and end with a
    letter.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> is the result of doubling each
    character in <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> that
    corresponds to a sticky key. At least one character in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> corresponds to a
    sticky key (i.e. <span class="tex2jax_process">$s \neq
    t$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output all characters (letters and space) corresponding to
    keys that must be sticky, in any order.</p>
