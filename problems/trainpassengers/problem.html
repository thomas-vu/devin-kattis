<p>The Nordic Company of Passing Carriages is losing money at
    an alarming rate because most of their trains are empty.
    However, on some lines the passengers are complaining that they
    cannot fit in the cars and have to wait for the next train!</p>
<p>The authorities want to fix this situation. They asked their
    station masters to write down, for a given train, how many
    people left the train at their station, how many went in, and
    how many had to wait. Then they hired your company of highly
    paid consultants to assign properly sized trains to their
    routes.</p>
<p>You just received the measurements for a train, but before
    feeding them to your optimisation algorithm you remembered that
    they were collected on a snowy day, so any sensible station
    master would have preferred to stay inside their cabin and make
    up the numbers instead of going outside and counting.</p>
<p>Verify your hunch by checking whether the input is
    inconsistent, i.e., at every time the number of people in the
    train did not exceed the capacity nor was below <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and no passenger waited in vain
    (i.e., waited on the station when there was room in the train).
    The train should start and finish the journey empty, in
    particular passengers should not wait for the train at the last
    station.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq C \leq 10^9$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq
    n \leq 100$</span>), the total capacity and the number of
    stations the train stops in. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contain three integers each,
    the number of people that left the train, entered the train,
    and had to stay at a station. Lines are given in the same order
    as the train visits each station. All integers are between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>One line containing one word: <tt>possible</tt> if the
    measurements are consistent, <tt>impossible</tt> otherwise.</p>
