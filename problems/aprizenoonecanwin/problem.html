<p>After the festive opening of your new store, the Boutique
    store for Alternative Paramedicine and Cwakhsahlvereigh, to
    your disappointment you find out that you are not making as
    many sales as you had hoped. To remedy this, you decide to run
    a special offer: you will mark some subset of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> items for sale in your store as
    participating in the offer, and if people buy exactly two of
    these items, and the cost of these items is <em>strictly</em>
    more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> euros, you
    will give them a free complimentary unicorn horn!</p>
<p>Since you recently found out all your unicorn horns are
    really narwhal tusks, you decide to rig the offer by picking
    the participating items in such a way that no one can earn a
    horn anyway.</p>
<p>To make sure no one becomes suspicious, you want to mark as
    many items as possible as participating in the offer.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>On the first line are two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$</span>, the number
        of items for sale in your store, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq X \leq 10^9$</span>, the minimum
        cost specified in the statement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the second line are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> positive integers, each at
        most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>. These are
        the prices of the items in the store.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the maximum number of items you can mark as part of
    your special offer, without anyone actually being able to
    receive a horn.</p>
