<p>The following puzzle was popularized by Martin Gardner’s
    book “My Best Mathematical and Logic Puzzles,” although it
    appears first in the monograph “On Problem-Solving” by the
    Gestalt psychologist Karl Dunker.</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<p><i class="it">One morning, exactly at sunrise, a Buddhist
      monk began to climb a tall mountain. The narrow path, no more
      than a foot or two wide, spiraled around the mountain to a
      glittering temple at the summit.</i></p>
<p><i class="it">The monk ascended the path at varying rates
      of speed, stopping many times along the way to rest and eat
      the dried fruit he carried with him. He reached the temple
      shortly before sunset. After several days of fasting and
      meditation he began his journey back along the same path,
      starting at sunrise and again walking at variable speeds with
      many pauses along the way. His average speed descending was,
      of course, greater than his average climbing speed.</i></p>
<p><i class="it">Prove that there is a spot along the path
      that the monk will occupy on both trips at precisely the same
      time of day!</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can probably see why this is true - but can you write a
    program that computes the time at which the monk will be at the
    same spot during his ascent and descent?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line
    contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; a \le 5\, 000$</span>)
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; d \le 5\, 000$</span>) denoting the
    number of segments during the ascent and descent, respectively.
    This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
    lines, each containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le h \le 1\, 000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; t \le 100$</span>) denoting the positive change in
    elevation (<span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>) the monk
    gained during this segment and the time it took (<span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>). If the monk rests and eats
    during a segment, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> will
    be <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<p>This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>
    lines, each containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le h \le 1\, 000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; t \le 100$</span>) denoting the change in elevation
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>) the monk descended
    during this segment and the time it took (<span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>). If the monk rests and eats
    during a segment, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> will
    be <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<p>The total change in elevation during the ascent and descent
    is guaranteed to be the same, i.e., the sum of the changes in
    elevation for the ascending segments is the same as the sum for
    the descending segments.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single floating point number, the earliest point in
    time at which the monk occupies the same spot during his climb
    and his descent. The monk starts his ascent and his descent at
    time <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> on both days.</p>
<p>Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or
    relative error does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span>.</p>
