<div class="problembody">
<p>John is a leading organizer of this year’s North America
    ICPC training camp. The camp lasts several days. On each day,
    there will be a lecture introducing two problems: one classical
    problem and one creative problem. Each problem can only be
    introduced once during the entire camp. Every problem has an
    integer difficulty level.</p>
<p>John knows that the lecture on each day should not be too
    overwhelming. Therefore, the sum of the difficulties of the two
    problems in a single day shall not exceed some fixed value.
    Also, the two problems on each day should be roughly on the
    same level. Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>’s be
    the absolute difference between the difficulties of the two
    problems introduced on any given day. The maximum of all of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>s, defined as
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>, should be as small as
    possible.</p>
<p>If John chooses problems well and arranges them wisely, what
    is the smallest <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> he can
    achieve for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> days
    of the ICPC training camp?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains four space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n, p, q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$</span>,<br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$n \leq \min (p, q)$</span>) and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq s \leq 10^9$</span>), where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of days
    of the camp, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is the
    number of classical problems, <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> is the number of creative
    problems, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is the
    maximum sum of difficulties on any given day.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>
    lines contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le x \le 10^9$</span>). These are difficulties of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> classical
    problems.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>
    lines contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le y \le 10^9$</span>). These are difficulties of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> creative problems.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the smallest <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> John can achieve, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> if there is no way John can
    select problems for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> training days.</p>
