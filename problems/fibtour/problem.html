<p>Charles is traveling to the fantastic Fibonacci City. The
    city has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> mansions of
    various heights and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    bi-directional roads connecting the mansions. One of the most
    exciting tourist attraction in the city is the <i class="it">Fibonacci Tour</i>, which is a simple path visiting a
    sequence of distinct mansions, so that every pair of
    consecutively visited mansions are directly connected by a
    road, and the heights of the mansions in the path form a
    continuous subsequence of the Fibonacci
    sequence:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,
    \dots \]</span>
<p>Each number in the Fibonacci sequence equals the sum of the
    previous two numbers, except for the first two numbers which
    are defined to be one.</p>
<p>Charles will be happier if his tour is longer. What is the
    maximum length of a Fibonacci Tour he can take? The length of a
    tour is the number of mansions visited in the tour. Charles can
    start the tour at any mansion.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line has two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 10^5$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq m\leq 10^5$</span>), giving the number
    of mansions and the number of roads in the city. The next line
    has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> positive integers
    no larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{18}$</span>.
    The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th integer gives
    the height of mansion <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.
    The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each
    has two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq a, b \leq n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a \neq b$</span>), indicating that there is
    a bi-directional road between mansion <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and mansion <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. Each pair of mansions is directly
    connected by at most one road.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the length of the longest Fibonacci Tour Charles can
    take in the city. If there is no tour Charles can take, output
    zero.</p>
