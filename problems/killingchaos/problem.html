<p>In the dangerous wild west, robbers are attacking a long
    train with many coaches. Chaos erupts, and the robbers realize
    that the amount of chaos equals the number of passengers in the
    train, rounded up to the nearest multiple of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. In order to quench the chaos,
    they therefore decide to kill some passengers by blowing up one
    of the coaches.</p>
<p>What the robbers failed to realize, however, is that when
    there are multiple disjoint train segments, then the total
    amount of chaos is equal to the sum of the chaos of each train
    segment <em>times</em> the number of train segments!</p>
<p>Frantic to quench the now even worse chaos, the robbers
    continue blowing up every coach until all passengers are dead.
    Phew!</p>
<p>The chaos in a train segment is equal to the number
    passengers in that train segment rounded up to the nearest
    multiple of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. What was
    the maximum amount of chaos during the robbery?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line is a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \leq n \leq 100\, 000$</span>), the number of coaches in the
    train. On the second line follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1, p_2, \ldots \, p_ n$</span>,
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq p_ i \leq 100$</span>
    for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$i \in \{ 1, 2, \ldots ,
    n\} $</span>) the number of passengers in each coach. On the
    third and final line follows a permutation of the numbers from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> indicating the order in which the
    robbers blew up the coaches.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single integer, the maximum chaos that occurred during the
    robbery.</p>
