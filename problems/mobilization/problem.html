<p>Mobilization is a brand new strategy game in which you are
    required to mobilize an army. The army can consist of different
    types of troops, each of which has a cost, health, and potency.
    You can acquire any combination of the troop types, even
    fractional, such that the total cost is no more than the amount
    you have to spend. The efficacy of the army is equal to its
    total health value multiplied by its total potency. What is the
    greatest efficacy you can achieve with the given purchasing
    constraints?</p>
<p>You may assume that there are always sufficient troops
    available to buy as many as you want (subject to the total
    constraint).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line will contain two integers, the number of
    different types of troops <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 30\, 000$</span> and the total budget you have to
    spend <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le b \le 100\, 000$</span>).</p>
<p>Following this will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each with three values for
    this troop type: an integer value of its unit cost <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le c \le 100\, 000$</span>, a real value of its unit health
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le h \le 1$</span>), and a real value of
    its unit potency <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le p \le 1$</span>). The
    real values may contain up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> digits after the decimal
    point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output is a line containing one number, the greatest
    possible efficacy expressed with a relative or absolute error
    less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.005$</span>.</p>
