<p>Mafia is a social game played frequently by high school
    competitors in informatics on summer and winter camps and
    national competitions, usually very late at night, drinking
    various fruit sodas. This game is not about winning, it’s about
    <del>los</del> taking part, like in competitions.</p>
<p>To solve this task, you don’t need to know the rules of
    mafia: all you need to know is that some of the players are
    “mobsters” and the rest are “civilians”. The mobsters know who
    is who, but the civilians don’t. The civilians are trying to
    figure out who the mobsters are during the game.</p>
<p>In the current round of the game, out of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> surviving players so far, each one
    has accused <em>exactly one</em> other player saying that he is
    the mobster. <em>The civilians were only guessing</em> and
    <em>the mobsters have accused civilians</em>, pretending to
    know nothing.</p>
<p>Not knowing who the mobsters are, but knowing who accused
    whom, determine <em>the maximum possible number of
    mobsters</em> among these players!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 500\, 000$</span>), the number of players. The
    players are labeled with integers from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>-th line of
    input, out of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, contains the label of the
    player accused by the player <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>. (No player can accuse
    themselves).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the maximum
    possible number of mobsters.</p>
