<div class="problembody">
<p>After the zombie invasion, everything in the country of
    Aabelrt was destroyed. To rebuild as quickly as possible, the
    government of Aabelrt decided to build the minimum possible
    number of roads between cities to make sure each city can reach
    every other city. Unfortunately, there is more construction
    work to be done—now that there are roads between cities, some
    residents are having trouble telling when they have crossed
    from one city into another. To remedy this, the government of
    Aabelrt has decided to give each city a number from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 2, \ldots , k\} $</span>,
    making sure that pairs of cities with a road between them get
    different numbers. But this process is not free—when a city is
    given a number, there is a significant amount of rebranding and
    construction to be done. The cost of assigning a city the
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> coins. To keep with the tradition
    of efficiency, the government would like to assign numbers in
    the cheapest way possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq
    10^5$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq
    20$</span>, representing the number of cities and the largest
    number available to assign to cities.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n - 1$</span>
    lines of input each contain two space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq u, v \leq n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$u \neq v$</span>) indicating
    there is a bidirectional road between cities <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that each city is reachable from every
    other city.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is possible to assign numbers such that each adjacent
    pair of cities get different numbers, output how many coins
    will be used in the cheapest way to do so. If it is impossible
    to do so, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
