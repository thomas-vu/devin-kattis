<p>Lea runs into a lot of words in her life. A lot of them she
    finds unpleasant. To compensate for that she started making up
    pleasant words. Lea makes up new words by writing a nice
    looking string of characters on a piece of paper. She than
    erases a few of the most nasty looking characters and replaces
    them with underscores ‘<tt class="ttfamily">_</tt>’. After that
    she tries to replace the underscores with more acceptable
    characters trying to form a pleasant word.</p>
<p>Lea considers words pleasant if they do not contain
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> sequential vowels,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> sequential consonants
    and contain at least one letter ‘<tt class="ttfamily">L</tt>’.</p>
<p>In Croatian, the vowels are the letters <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">E</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">I</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt>, and <tt class="ttfamily">U</tt> only. All other letters are consonants.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains a string of
    characters, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>.
    The string contains only of uppercase English letters and
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">_</tt>’ characters. There will be at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> ‘<tt class="ttfamily">_</tt>’ characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output should contain a single
    integer – the total number of pleasant words that can be formed
    by substituting underscores with uppercase letters of the
    English alphabet.</p>
