<p>Gunnar and Emma play a lot of board games at home, so they
    own many dice that are not normal <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>-sided dice. For example they own a
    die that has <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> sides
    with numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$47, 48, \ldots ,
    56$</span> on it.</p>
<p>There has been a big storm in Stockholm, so Gunnar and Emma
    have been stuck at home without electricity for a couple of
    hours. They have finished playing all the games they have, so
    they came up with a new one. Each player has 2 dice which he or
    she rolls. The player with a bigger sum wins. If both sums are
    the same, the game ends in a tie.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Given the description of Gunnar’s and Emma’s dice, which
    player has higher chances of winning?</p>
<p>All of their dice have the following property: each die
    contains numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a, a+1, \dots ,
    b$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> are the lowest and
    highest numbers respectively on the die. Each number appears
    exactly on one side, so the die has <span class="tex2jax_process">$b-a+1$</span> sides.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2$</span> that describe
    Gunnar’s dice. Die number <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> contains numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i, a_ i + 1, \dots , b_ i$</span> on its
    sides. You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le
    a_ i \le b_ i \le 100$</span>. You can further assume that each
    die has at least four sides, so <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i + 3\le b_ i$</span>.</p>
<p>The second line contains the description of Emma’s dice in
    the same format.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the name of the player that has higher probability of
    winning. Output “<tt class="tt">Tie</tt>” if both players have
    same probability of winning.</p>
