<p>The postal service is interested in cutting costs as an
    alternative to raising the postage rates. One way to do this is
    by minimizing the distance traveled when delivering mail from
    the post office to all the required locations and returning to
    the post office. It may be that all the mail to be delivered
    does not fit on the mail truck at once, in which case the
    distance traveled by the truck must include travel back to the
    post office to reload. For simplicity, we assume a one
    dimensional world with the post office at the origin, and
    delivery locations each identified by a single coordinate. As
    an example, suppose a postal truck can carry up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> letters and that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> letters need to
    be delivered to location <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10$</span>, that <span class="tex2jax_process">$175$</span> need to be delivered to
    location <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> delivered to
    location <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span>. A
    maximally efficient plan would be:</p>
<p>Deliver the <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>
    letters to location <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10$</span>
    (travel <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \cdot 10$</span>), the
    first <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> letters
    to location <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> (travel
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \cdot 10$</span>), the
    remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$75$</span> letters to location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> while on the way to
    delivering the <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> to
    location <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> (travel
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \cdot 25$</span>). The total
    round-trip distance traveled is <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq N \leq 1000$</span> is the number of
    delivery addresses on the route, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq K \leq 10\, 000$</span> is the
    carrying capacity of the postal truck. Each of the following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines will contain two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ j$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ j$</span>, the location of a
    delivery and the number of letters to deliver there, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1500 \leq x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt;
    \cdots &lt; x_ N \leq 1500$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq t_ j \leq 800$</span> for all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>. All delivery
    locations are nonzero (that is, none are at the post
    office).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum total travel distance needed to deliver
    all the letters and return to the post office.</p>
