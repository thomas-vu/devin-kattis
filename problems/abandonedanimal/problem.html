</div>Your little sister has been a big help today: she went
    into town to do all the groceries! During this grand voyage,
    she was accompanied by her fluffy friend, Mr. Fluffynose
    the Stuffed Animal. However, after her return, it seems that
    she has left him somewhere along the route! This is devastating
    news for your little sister, and as she won’t stop crying about
    it, you decide to retrace her steps through town.

    <p>You know that your sister will hold on to her beloved
    Fluffynose whenever possible, so the only time she could’ve
    lost it is when she grabbed an item on her shopping list. So,
    all you have to do is figure out at what store she bought what,
    and then you’ll reunite her with her counterpart in no time!
    However, you soon find out that this isn’t quite as easy as you
    thought: she went to a lot of stores, and although she knows
    the names of the stores she went to and the order in which she
    visited them, she does not recall what she bought at each store
    (it could have been nothing!). It would take a lot of time to
    blindly search all the stores for all these items. As you have
    better things to do today, like solving programming problems,
    you want to spend as little time on this retrieval as possible.
    Therefore, you want to know exactly which items your sister
    bought at each store before you start your search.</p>
<p>For this you have two pieces of information: firstly you
    know the inventory of all stores your sister went to. Secondly,
    you know exactly in what order she purchased the groceries, as
    she has very carefully stacked all items into her bag. You
    decide to number the stores your sister visited according to
    the order in which she visited them. Given this information,
    you want to decide whether you know for sure where she bought
    every item so you can retrace her steps as efficiently as
    possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line with a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 100{,}000$</span>,
    the number of supermarkets in town. Then follows a line with an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N\leq K \leq
    100{,}000$</span>, after which <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> lines follow with a
    space-separated integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span>) and a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> (consisting of only lowercase
    letters, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>),
    denoting that item <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is
    available at the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text
    {th}$</span> store that your sister visited. It is guaranteed
    that every store has at least one item, every item is available
    at at least one store, and that every item occurs at most once
    at every store.</p>
<p>The second part of the input contains the list of items your
    sister bought, in order of purchase. It starts with a line with
    an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M\leq K$</span>, the
    number of items your sister has bought. Then follow
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines, each with
    string <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, denoting the
    name of the item your sister bought. The items are given in the
    order she purchased them in. All items that your sister has
    bought are unique.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>" if there is no
    path through the stores that matches your sister’s description.
    Output “<tt class="ttfamily">unique</tt>" if there is exactly
    one path through the stores that matches. Output “<tt class="ttfamily">ambiguous</tt>" if there are multiple possible
    paths.</p>
