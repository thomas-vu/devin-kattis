<div class="problembody">
<p>Moving to a new town can be difficult. Finding a good place
    to live which is close to everything you’re interested in is
    important. However, since you’re a great programmer, you know
    that you can solve this problem with an algorithm.</p>
<p>Everything in your virtualized town is laid out on a grid,
    so every place lies on an integer coordinate grid. You’ll be
    given a list of coordinates of the places you are interested in
    in the town, and you need to choose a place to live on the
    grid. Your program should find the grid location that minimizes
    the average straight-line squared distance to every place you
    are interested in (squared distance so that you won’t be too
    far from any one location).</p>
<p>You can live anywhere on the grid, even if something already
    exists where you want to live (buildings can always be built
    taller to accommodate you).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a list of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> descriptions for towns you are
    considering moving to. Each town description starts with a line
    containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1\,
    000$</span>, the number of locations you’re interested in. The
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    contain two space-separated integer coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, each in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0, 1\, 000]$</span>. No location is
    repeated within a town. Input ends when <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each town, print the location you want to live on the
    grid. If the best location is not exactly on a grid point,
    choose the grid point closest to the best location. Break ties
    by choosing the point that has the smallest <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> coordinate and then the smallest
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinate.</p>
