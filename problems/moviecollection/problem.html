<div class="problembody">
<p>Mr. K. I. has a very big movie collection. He
    has organized his collection in a big stack. Whenever he wants
    to watch one of the movies, he locates the movie in this stack
    and removes it carefully, ensuring that the stack doesn’t fall
    over. After he finishes watching the movie, he places it at the
    top of the stack.</p>
<p>Since the stack of movies is so big, he needs to keep track
    of the position of each movie. It is sufficient to know for
    each movie how many movies are placed above it, since, with
    this information, its position in the stack can be calculated.
    Each movie is identified by a number printed on the movie
    box.</p>
<p>Your task is to implement a program which will keep track of
    the position of each movie. In particular, each time
    Mr. K. I. removes a movie box from the stack,
    your program should print the number of movies that were placed
    above it before it was removed.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line a positive integer: the number of test
    cases, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>.
    After that, for each test case output:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\le m, r\le 100\, 000)$</span>: the
        number of movies in the stack and the number of locate
        requests, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, \ldots , a_
        r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a_ i \le
        m$</span>) representing the identification numbers of
        movies that Mr. K. I. wants to watch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For simplicity, assume that the initial stack contains the
    movies with identification numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \ldots , m$</span> in increasing
    order, where the movie box with label <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is the top-most box.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
        integers, where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th integer gives the number of
        movie boxes above the box with label <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>, immediately before this
        box is removed from the stack.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that after each locate request <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>, the movie box with label
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> is placed at the
    top of the stack.</p>
