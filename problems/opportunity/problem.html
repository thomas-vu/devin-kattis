<div class="problembody">
<p>As with most types of products, buying a new phone can be
    difficult. One of the main challenges is that there are a lot
    of different aspects of the phone that you might care about,
    such as its price, its performance, and how user-friendly the
    phone is. Typically, there will be no single phone that is
    simultaneously the best at all of these things: the cheapest
    phone, the most powerful phone, and the most user-friendly
    phone will likely be different phones.</p>
<p>Thus when buying a phone, you are forced to make some
    sacrifices by balancing the different aspects you care about
    against each other and choosing the phone that achieves the
    best compromise (where “best” of course depends on what your
    priorities happen to be). One way of measuring this sacrifice
    is known as the <em>opportunity cost</em>, which (for the
    purposes of this problem) we define as follows.</p>
<p>Suppose that you have bought a phone with price <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, performance <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, and user-friendliness
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span>. For simplicity, we
    assume that these three values are measured on a comparable
    numeric scale where higher is better. If there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> available phones, and the values
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i,y_ i,z_ i)$</span>
    represent the (price, performance, user-friendliness) of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> phone,
    then the opportunity cost of your phone is defined
    as</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \max _{1 \le i \le n}
    \left( \max (x_ i-x, 0) + \max (y_ i-y, 0) + \max (z_ i-z, 0)
    \right). \]</span>
<p>Write a program that, given the list of available phones,
    finds a phone with the minimum opportunity cost.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n \leq 200\, 000$</span>), the number of phones
    considered. Following that are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> of these lines
    contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_
    i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$z_ i$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> is the price, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span> is the performance, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$z_ i$</span> is the
    user-friendliness of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> phone (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x_ i, y_ i, z_ i \leq
    10^9$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing two integers: the smallest
    possible opportunity cost and an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> indicating the phone achieving
    that opportunity cost. If there are multiple such phones,
    output the one with the smallest index.</p>
