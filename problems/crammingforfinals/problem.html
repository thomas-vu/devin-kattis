<div class="problembody">
<p>It’s final exam season and Ashley is heading to her favorite
    library to cram for finals.</p>
<p>The library has a dedicated floor for studying where there
    are <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> rows of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> tables evenly spaced.
    Each table only has room for one student, and some students
    have already arrived and claimed their favorite tables.</p>
<p>Because the floor is usually very quiet, it is possible to
    hear sounds from other students who are nearby – for example,
    frustrated typing on a laptop keyboard or nervous leg shaking.
    Specifically, if one student is studying at the table in row
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i_1$</span> and column
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j_1$</span>, and another student
    is studying at the table in row <span class="tex2jax_process">$i_2$</span> and column <span class="tex2jax_process">$j_2$</span>, it is possible for the two
    students to hear sounds from each other if and only if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sqrt{(i_1 - i_2)^2 + (j_1 -
    j_2)^2} \le d$</span>.</p>
<p>With this, Ashley wants to find an empty table where she can
    hear as few other students as possible. Compute the minimum
    number of students that Ashley can hear if she selects her
    table optimally.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input has four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq r, c \leq 10^9$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq d \leq 2\, 500$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 10^3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n
    \leq r \cdot c - 1$</span>).</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le i \le r$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le j \le c$</span>), indicating that a student is studying at
    the table at row <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and
    column <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>. It is
    guaranteed that no two students are sitting at the same
    table.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the minimum number of
    students that Ashley can hear if she selects her table
    optimally.</p>
