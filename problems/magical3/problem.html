</div>There’s no doubt about it, three is a magical number.
    Two’s company, but three’s a crowd, no one ever talks about 2
    blind mice, and there are three members in an ACM ICPC team.

    <p>Even more magically, almost all integers can be represented
    as a number that ends in 3 in some numeric base, sometimes in
    more than one way. Consider the number 11, which is represented
    as 13 in base 8 and 23 in base 4. For this problem, you will
    find the smallest base for a given number so that the number’s
    representation in that base ends in 3.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each line of the input contains one nonnegative integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. The value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = 0$</span> represents the end
    of the input and should not be processed. All input integers
    are less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{31}$</span>.
    There are no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\,
    000$</span> nonzero values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each nonzero value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> in the input, print on a single
    line the smallest base for which the number has a
    representation that ends in 3. If there is no such base, print
    instead “<tt>No such base</tt>”.</p>
