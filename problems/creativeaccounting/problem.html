<div class="problembody">
<p>When accounting for the profit of a business, we can divide
    consecutive days into fixed-sized segments and calculate each
    segment’s profit as the sum of all its daily profits. For
    example, we could choose seven-day segments to do our
    accounting in terms of weekly profit. We also have the
    flexibility of choosing a segment’s starting day. For example,
    for weekly profit we can start a week on a Sunday, Monday, or
    even Wednesday. Choosing different segment starting days may
    sometimes change how the profit looks on the books, making it
    more (or less) attractive to investors.</p>
<p>As an example, we can divide ten consecutive days of profit
    (or loss, which we denote as negative profit) into three-day
    segments as such:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 3, 2,
    {-7} \: |\: 5, 4, 1 \: |\: 3, 0, {-3} \: |\: 5 \]</span>
<p>This gives us four segments with profit <span class="tex2jax_process">$-2, 10, 0, 5$</span>. For the purpose of
    this division, partial segments with fewer than the fixed
    segment size are allowed at the beginning and at the end. We
    say a segment is profitable if it has a strictly positive
    profit. In the above example, only two out of the four segments
    are profitable.</p>
<p>If we try a different starting day, we can
    obtain:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 3, 2 \: |\: {-7},
    5, 4 \: |\: 1, 3, 0 \: |\: {-3}, 5 \]</span>
<p>This gives us four segments with profit <span class="tex2jax_process">$5, 2, 4, 2$</span>. All four segments are
    profitable, which makes our business look much more
    consistent.</p>
<p>You’re given a list of consecutive days of profit, as well
    as an integer range. If we can choose any segment size within
    that range and any starting day for our accounting, what is the
    minimum and maximum number of profitable segments that we can
    have?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input has three space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le \ell \le h \le n \le 3 \times 10^4$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h - \ell \le 1\, 000$</span>), where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of days
    in the books, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> is
    the minimum possible choice of segment size, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> is the maximum possible choice of
    segment size.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^4 \le p \le 10^4$</span>). These are the
    daily profits, in order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output on a single line two space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$min$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$max$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$min$</span> is the minimum number of
    profitable segments possible, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$max$</span> is the maximum number of
    profitable segments possible. Both <span class="tex2jax_process">$min$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$max$</span> are taken over all possible
    choices of segment size between <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> and all possible choices of
    starting day.</p>
