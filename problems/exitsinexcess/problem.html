<p>You own a disco called the Boogie Always Persists Club. The
    club is famous for its multiple interconnected rooms to twist
    and shout in. The rooms and the corridors between them form a
    maze-like structure and for added bonus you have made all the
    corridors one-way. However, it turns out not everyone is as
    happy with your club as you are. Recently the fire safety
    inspectors came by and they were not amused by what they saw:
    if a fire were to break out in one of the rooms, people would
    have great difficulty finding the fire exits and might even
    start running around in circles! They find this completely
    unacceptable and order you to improve things as quickly as
    possible. They insist that you have to make sure that no one
    can run around in circles in the club by removing some of the
    corridors between the rooms.</p>
<p>You, on the other hand, want to retain the attractiveness of
    the rooms. You do not want to remove too many corridors,
    because then people will no longer visit your club. You decide
    that at most half of the corridors may be removed.</p>
<p>Given the layout of the club, remove at most half of the
    corridors so that no cycles remain.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing the number of rooms <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 10^5$</span> and the number
        of corridors <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq m\leq
        2\cdot 10^5$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
        lines, each containing two different <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-based integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> indicating a corridor from
        room <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> to room
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>. There will be no
        corridor from a room to itself, nor will there be more than
        one corridor from one room to any other single room.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>On the first line, print a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq r\leq m/2$</span>, the number of
        corridors to be removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then print <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
        lines containing the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-based indices of the corridors
        that need to be removed to ensure that dancers cannot go
        around in circles in the disco anymore.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are multiple valid solutions, you may output any
    one of them.</p>
