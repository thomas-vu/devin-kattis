<p>Odd and Even have had their share of fun times playing the
    good old prime game:</p>
<p>They start with an arbitrary natural number, and take turns
    either adding <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> or
    dividing by a prime (assuming the result is still a natural
    number), and the one to reach <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is the winner. However, now that
    they have a new friend, Ingmariay, they have decided to expand
    the rules of the game to allow for three-player action:</p>
<p>Instead of determining a winner for each round of play, they
    instead score points; the lowest number each of them has
    claimed during the round is the amount of points they get. (If
    any of them did not have the opportunity to claim any numbers,
    the starting number will be their score for that round.) At the
    end of the day, the player with the fewest points wins. And to
    avoid bad blood between themselves, they have all agreed that
    each of them only will focus on minimizing their own scores,
    and that whenever a player can choose different numbers that
    will result in the same score, that player will choose the
    lowest of those numbers. They have also agreed on a fixed order
    of play: Odd <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow
    $</span> Even <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow
    $</span> Ingmariay <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow
    ...$</span>, but they alternate who gets to start.</p>
<p>You recently missed one of their exciting evenings of play,
    because you had to make problems for the NCPC event.
    Fortunately for you, they had recorded the numbers and starting
    players for each round, and told you that since they always
    play optimally (minimizing their own score), you could use this
    to simulate the event for yourself. Oh joy!</p>
<p>As an example round, assume that Even is chosen as the
    starting player, and with the starting number <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span>. Then Even claims <span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span>, Ingmariay <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>, Odd <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, Even <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and Ingmariay <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Odd gets <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> points, Even <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and Ingmariay <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span>), the number
    of rounds they played that evening.</p>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    each beginning with the first character of the name of the
    starting player (either ’O’, ’E’ or ’I’), followed by a space
    and then the starting number for that round, in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1, 10\, 000]$</span></p>
<p><em>Note: If the starting number is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, all players receive <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> point for that round.</em></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line with the score at the end of the day
    for each of the three contestants, in the order “Odd”, “Even”,
    “Ingmariay”.</p>
