        Highly aesthetic tower of height 5
      </div>
</div>
<p>You are very well aware of the saying “When life gives you
    blocks, make towers!”. So, you decide to do exactly that.</p>
<p>You have <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> blocks of
    size <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_ i \times w_ i \times
    1$</span> (that is, the height of each block is 1 unit). You
    want to completely use up all these blocks such that the
    average height of towers is as high as possible. Towers are
    made in the usual way: by stacking up blocks one on top of the
    other.</p>
<p>Of course, you have an eye for beauty, so just any random
    stack of blocks does not count as a tower for you. For every
    block in a tower (except the bottom-most block), you wish to
    ensure that it is “just the right amount” smaller than the
    block below it. More precisely, you can put block j on top of
    block k if and only if <span class="tex2jax_process">$x \cdot
    l_ k \leq l_ j \leq y \cdot l_ k$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x \cdot w_ k \leq w_ j \leq y \cdot w_
    k$</span>. You are guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$ 0 &lt; x \leq y &lt; 1 $</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains three space separated
    positive integers: the number of blocks <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n \leq 200 $</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$x\prime $</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq x\prime &lt; 10^6 $</span>), and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y\prime $</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq y\prime &lt; 10^6 $</span>) where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = \frac{x\prime
    }{10^6}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y =
    \frac{y\prime }{10^6}$</span>. You are guaranteed that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$ x \leq y $</span>. Then follow
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each describing
    a block. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> line
    contains two space separated positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_ i$</span> corresponding to the length and
    width of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span>
    block. You are guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$
    1 \leq l_ i, w_ i \leq 10^9$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single integer, the number of towers in an
    arrangement of blocks that maximizes the average height of the
    towers. It can be proven that the answer is unique.</p>
