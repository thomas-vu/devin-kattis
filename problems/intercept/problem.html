<p>Fatima commutes from KTH to home by subway every day. Today
    Robert decided to surprise Fatima by baking cookies and
    bringing them to an intermediate station. Fatima does not
    always take the same route home, because she loves to admire
    the artwork inside different stations in Stockholm. However,
    she always optimizes her travel by taking the shortest route.
    Can you tell Robert which station he should go to in order to
    surely intercept Fatima?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N,M \leq 100\, 000$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the number of subway stations
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> is the number of
    subway links. <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines
    follow, each with three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq u,v &lt; N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt;
    w \leq 1\, 000\, 000\, 000$</span>, meaning that there is a
    one-way link from <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> that takes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> seconds to complete.
    Note that different subway lines may serve the same route.</p>
<p>The last line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq s,t &lt; N$</span> the number of the station closest to
    KTH and closest to home, respectively. It is possible to reach
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> from <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A space separated list of all the station numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> such that all shortest
    paths from <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> pass through
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>, in increasing
    order.</p>
