<div class="problembody">
<p>John has never been very good at maths. Due to his bad
    grades, his parents have sent him to the Academic Coalition of
    Mathematics (ACM). Despite the large amount of money his
    parents are spending on the ACM, John does not pay much
    attention during classes. However, today he has begun to think
    about all the effort his parents are putting into his
    education, and he has started to feel somewhat…guilty. So he
    has made a decision: he is going to improve his maths
    grades!</p>

<p>However, no sooner had he resolved to pay attention than the
    lesson ended. So the only thing he has been able to do is to
    hurriedly copy the content of the blackboard in his notebook.
    Today, the teacher was explaining basic arithmetic expressions
    with unknowns. He vaguely remembers that his classmates have
    been substituting values into the unknowns to obtain the
    expressions’ results. However, in all the hurry, John has only
    written down expressions, values and results in a messy
    fashion. So he does not know which value comes with each
    unknown, or which result goes with each expression.</p>
<p>That is the reason he needs your help: he wants to know,
    given an expression, some values and a result, whether it is
    possible or not to assign those values to the unknowns in order
    for the expression to evaluate to the given result. The
    particular assignment of values does not matter to John, as he
    wants to do it by himself. He only wants to know whether it is
    possible or not.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains at most 4000 testcases. Each test case in
    the input file consists of two lines:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains a sequence of natural numbers.
        The first one (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \leq
        5$</span>) is the number of unknowns that will occur in the
        expression. It is followed by a sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_1 \ldots v_ n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq v_ i \leq 50$</span>), which are
        the values to be assigned to the unknowns. Finally, there
        is an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq m \leq 1000$</span>)
        representing the desired result of the evaluation of the
        expression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second line contains an arithmetic expression
        composed of lowercase letters (<tt class="ttfamily">a-z</tt>), brackets (<tt class="ttfamily">(</tt>
        and <tt class="ttfamily">)</tt>) and binary operators
        (<tt class="ttfamily">+</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">-</tt>,
        <tt class="ttfamily">*</tt>). This expression will contain
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> unknowns,
        represented by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        different lowercase letters, without repetitions. The
        expression will not contain any blanks and will always be
        syntactically correct, i.e. it is just an unknown or
        has the form <tt class="ttfamily">(</tt><span class="tex2jax_process">$e_1$</span> <em>op</em> <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_2$</span> <tt class="ttfamily">)</tt>,
        where <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_1$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_2$</span> are expressions
        and <em>op</em> is one of the three possible binary
        operators.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The input will finish with a dummy test case of just one
    line containing <tt class="ttfamily">0 0</tt>, which must not
    be processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print a single line with <tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt> if there exists an assignment of the values
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_1 \ldots v_ n$</span> to the
    unknowns such that the expression evaluates to <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, and <tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt>
    otherwise. Notice that each value <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> must be assigned to exactly one
    unknown.</p>
