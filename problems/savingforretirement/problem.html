<div class="problembody">
<p>Alice is saving for her retirement. She hasnâ€™t really
    decided how much she wants to save, but when she retires, she
    wants to have strictly more money than Bob will have when he
    retires.</p>
<p>Bob is <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> years old.
    He plans to retire when he becomes <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ r$</span> years old. He saves
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ s$</span> every year from now
    until then.</p>
<p>Alice is <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> years old.
    She wants to save <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ s$</span>
    every year. When is the earliest time she can retire?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a single line consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> space separated integers;
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ r$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ s$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_
    s$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the age at which Alice can retire so that she has
    more money than Bob will have at age <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ r$</span>.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$20 \leq B \leq B_ r \leq
        100$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$20 \leq A \leq
        100$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq A_ s, B_ s \le
        100$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Explanation of first example</h2>
<p>At the age of <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> Bob
    has saved <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> every year
    for <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> years. This means
    he has <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> saved up.<br/>
    At the age of <span class="tex2jax_process">$23$</span> Alice
    has saved <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> every year
    for <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> years. This means
    she has <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> saved up,
    which is strictly more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span>.<br/></p>
