<p>Bubble Tea is now one of the most popular drink in Vietnam.
    Nowadays, walking down on the street, you can find a bubble tea
    shop everywhere. A huge number of bubble tea brands have
    arrived: <i class="itshape">Bobapop, Chago, DingTea, GongCha,
    Mr.GoodTea, RoyalTea, ToCoToCo,…</i> Bubble tea attracts
    students not only as a tasty drink, but also with various kinds
    of extra topping: alo vera, chocolate flan, coconut jelly, egg
    pudding, fruity pearl,…Ok, I will stop writing this statement
    here as I must get some bubble tea immediately. It is so so so
    addictive.</p>

<p>After teaching a philosophy class to Vietnamese students
    preparing for <i class="itshape">International Philosophy
    Olympiad</i>, <i class="itshape">PVH</i> invites his students
    to enjoy a cup of bubble tea. The tea shop sells <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> kinds of tea and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> kinds of topping. Every kind of
    tea or topping has its own price. For each student, <i class="itshape">PVH</i> will buy him a cup of tea with exactly one
    kind of topping. The cost of a cup equals to the cost of the
    tea plus the cost of the topping. However, not every kind of
    topping can be mixed with every kind of tea. For each kind of
    tea, we know the list of toppings can be mixed with.</p>
<p>Given the amount of money <i class="itshape">PVH</i> has, he
    would like to know how many students he can invite to the
    party, if one student drinks exactly one cup of bubble tea.
    Remember, he never watches his students drinking bubble tea
    without drinking anything, so he must buy himself a cup of
    bubble tea first!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> - the amount of kinds of tea
        the shop has.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers - the price of all
        kinds of tea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third line contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> - the amount of toppings the
        shop has.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The forth line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> integers - the price of all
        kinds of topping.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> of the
        next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
        describes the toppings that can be mixed with th
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> kind of tea.
        The line starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> integers. All these
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> integers are in
        the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1, M]$</span> and
        pairwise different. Each integer denotes a kind of topping
        which can be combined with the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> kind of tea.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last line contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> - the amount of money
        <i class="itshape">PVH</i> has.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Write the maximum number of students <i class="itshape">PVH</i> can buy bubble tea for.</p>
<h2>Constraints</h2>
<p>The amount of money is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>, inclusive. All other numbers
    in the input files are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>, inclusive.</p>
<h2>Sample clarification</h2>
<p>In this example, there are three kinds of tea with price 10,
    20 and 30; as well as five kinds of topping with price from 1
    to 5.</p>
<p>The cheapest combination of tea and topping is the first
    kind of tea with the forth kind of topping, with a total cost
    of 14. Note that, while combining the first kind of tea with
    the first kind of topping gives lower price (11), it is not
    allowed since the first kind of tea is only combinable with
    toppings of kind 4 and 5. (See the <span class="tex2jax_process">$5^{th}$</span> line of the input).</p>
<p>Hence, with the amount of money of 42, <i class="itshape">PVH</i> can buy three cups of tea, one for him and
    two more for his students!</p>
