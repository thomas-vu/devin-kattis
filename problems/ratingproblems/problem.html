<div class="problembody">
<p>Your judges are preparing a problem set, and they’re trying
    to evaluate a problem for inclusion in the set. Each judge
    rates the problem with an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$-3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, where:</p>
<center>
<table cellspacing="0" class="tabular">
<tr>
<td style="text-align:right">
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span></p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>means: I <em>really</em> like this problem!</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:right">
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$-3$</span></p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>means: I <em>really don’t</em> like this
            problem!</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:right">
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span></p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>means: Meh. I don’t care if we use this problem or
            not.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<p>The overall rating of the problem is the average of all of
    the judges’ ratings—that is, the sum of the ratings divided by
    the number of judges providing a rating.</p>
<p>Some judges have already rated the problem. Compute the
    minimum and maximum possible overall rating that the problem
    can end up with after the other judges submit their
    ratings.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 10$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le k \le n$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the total number of judges, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is the number of
    judges who have already rated the problem.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    lines contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-3
    \le r \le 3$</span>). These are the ratings of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> judges that have already rated the
    problem.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two space-separated floating point numbers on a
    single line, which are the minimum and maximum overall rating
    the problem could achieve after the remaining judges rate the
    problem, minimum first. These values must be accurate to an
    absolute or relative error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span>.</p>
