<p>Just outside the entrance to your mine shaft you have a row
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> furnaces; some of
    them are on and some are off. Unlike regular furnaces, these
    furnaces can only be turned on in neighboring pairs. In one
    move you can either choose two neighboring furnaces which are
    on and turn both of them off, or choose two neighboring
    furnaces which are off and turn both of them on.</p>
<p>You want to turn all of them on as quickly as possible. If
    it is possible to turn all the furnaces on, output the minimum
    number of moves to do so. Otherwise, output “impossible”.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 10^6$</span>. The next line contains a binary
    string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i=0$</span> means the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th furnace in the row is off and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i=1$</span> means the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th furnace in the row
    is on.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The minimum number of moves to turn all of the furnaces on,
    or “impossible” if it is not possible to do so.</p>
