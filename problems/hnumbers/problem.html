<p>This problem is based on an exercise of David Hilbert, who
    pedagogically suggested that one study the theory of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4n+1$</span> numbers. Here, we
    do only a bit of that.</p>
<p>An <b class="bfseries">H</b>-number is a positive number
    which is one more than a multiple of four: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21,...$</span> are the
    <b class="bfseries">H</b>-numbers. For this problem we pretend
    that these are the <em>only</em> numbers. The <b class="bfseries">H</b>-numbers are closed under multiplication.</p>
<p>As with regular integers, we partition the <b class="bfseries">H</b>-numbers into units, <b class="bfseries">H</b>-primes, and <b class="bfseries">H</b>-composites. <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is the only unit. An <b class="bfseries">H</b>-number <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> is <b class="bfseries">H</b>-prime
    if it is not the unit, and is the product of two <b class="bfseries">H</b>-numbers in only one way: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \cdot h$</span>. The rest of the numbers
    are <b class="bfseries">H</b>-composite.</p>
<p>For examples, the first few <b class="bfseries">H</b>-composites are: <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \cdot 5 = 25$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \cdot 9 = 45$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \cdot 13 = 65$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$9 \cdot 9 = 81$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \cdot 17 = 85$</span>.</p>
<p>Your task is to count the number of <b class="bfseries">H</b>-semi-primes. An <b class="bfseries">H</b>-semi-prime is an <b class="bfseries">H</b>-number which can be written as the product of
    exactly two <b class="bfseries">H</b>-primes. The two <b class="bfseries">H</b>-primes may be equal or different. Of the
    examples above, all five numbers are <b class="bfseries">H</b>-semi-primes. <span class="tex2jax_process">$125 = 5 \cdot 5 \cdot 5$</span> is not an
    <b class="bfseries">H</b>-semi-prime, because it is the product
    of three <b class="bfseries">H</b>-primes.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each line of input contains an <b class="bfseries">H</b>-number <span class="tex2jax_process">$h \le
    1\, 000\, 001$</span>. The last line of input contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and this line should
    not be processed. There are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span> test cases.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each <b class="bfseries">H</b>-number <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> in the input, print a line with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> followed by the number
    of <b class="bfseries">H</b>-semi-primes between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> inclusive, separated by one space
    in the format shown in the sample.</p>
