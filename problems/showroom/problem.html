<p>A car showroom is one of the few places where cars can be
    found indoors. Showrooms often have many cars, even above
    ground level! As cars are sold and new cars are bought in to
    sell, the cars must be moved carefully out of the showroom.</p>
<p>Clearly employees only wish to move cars if they have to.
    So, given a map of a showroom including its walls, doors and
    where the cars are, and the co-ordinates of the car to move,
    how many cars must be moved?</p>
<p>Cars can be rotated on the spot, but can only be moved
    through a completely empty space and not diagonally. Doors are
    always wide enough to move a car through.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le R,C \le 400$</span>), the size of
        the showroom in rows and columns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> lines,
        each containing a string of <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> characters with the following
        meaning:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>’<tt class="ttfamily">#</tt>’: a wall;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>’<tt class="ttfamily">c</tt>’: a car;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>’<tt class="ttfamily">D</tt>’: a door in a wall.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The first and last lines must be walls or doors. The
        first and last characters in a row must be walls or
        doors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next line will contain two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 &lt; r &lt; R$</span>), and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 &lt; c &lt; C$</span>), the
        co-ordinates of the car to move. <span class="tex2jax_process">$1,1$</span> is the top-left corner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing one integer: the smallest number of
        cars that need to be moved (including the car we are
        moving) to allow our desired car to leave the building.</p>
</li>
