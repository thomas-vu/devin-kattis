<p>You are working for an agency that selects the best software
    engineers from Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg for
    employment at various international companies. Given the very
    large number of excellent software engineers these countries
    have to offer, the agency has charged you to develop a tool
    that quickly selects the best candidates available from the
    agency’s files.</p>
<p>Before a software engineer is included in the agency’s
    files, he has to undergo extensive testing. Based on these
    tests, all software engineers are ranked on three essential
    skills: communication skills, programming skills, and
    algorithmic knowledge. The software engineer with rank one in
    the category algorithmic knowledge is the best algorithmic
    expert in the files, with rank two the second best,
    etcetera.</p>
<p>For potential customers, your tool needs to process the
    agency’s files and produce a shortlist of the potentially most
    interesting candidates. A software engineer is a potential
    candidate that is to be put on this shortlist if there is no
    other software engineer in the files that scores better on all
    three skills. That is, an engineer is to be put on the
    shortlist if there is no other software engineer that has
    better communication skills, better programming skills, and
    more algorithmic knowledge.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100\, 000$</span>): the
        number of software engineers in the agency’s files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        with three space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_3$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq r_1, r_2, r_3 \leq n$</span>):
        the rank of each software engineer from the files with
        respect to his communication skills, programming skills and
        algorithmic knowledge, respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For each skill <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and
    each rank <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, there is exactly one engineer
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ s = x$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a single integer: the number of candidates
        on the shortlist.</p>
</li>
</ul>
