<div class="problembody">
<p>A very simplistic scheme, which was used at one time to
    encode information, is to rotate the characters within an
    alphabet and rewrite them. ROT13 is the variant in which the
    characters A-Z are rotated 13 places, and it was a commonly
    used insecure scheme that attempted to “hide” data in many
    applications from the late 1990’s and into the early
    2000’s.</p>
<p>It has been decided by Insecure Inc. to develop a product
    that “improves” upon this scheme by first reversing the entire
    string and then rotating it. As an example, if we apply this
    scheme to string <tt class="ttfamily">ABCD</tt> with a reversal
    and rotation of 1, after the reversal we would have DCBA and
    then after rotating that by 1 position we have the result
    <tt class="ttfamily">EDCB</tt>.</p>
<p>Your task is to implement this encoding scheme for strings
    that contain only capital letters, underscores, and periods.
    Rotations are to be performed using the alphabet order:</p>
<pre>
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ_.
</pre>
<p>Note that underscore follows Z, and the period follows the
    underscore. Thus a forward rotation of 1 means <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt> is shifted to <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>,
    that is:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">A</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span> <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">B</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span> <tt class="ttfamily">C</tt></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$\vdots $</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">Z</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span> <tt class="ttfamily">_</tt></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">_</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span> <tt class="ttfamily">.</tt></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">.</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span> <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Likewise a rotation of 3 means:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">A</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span> <tt class="ttfamily">D</tt></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">B</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span> <tt class="ttfamily">E</tt></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$\vdots $</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">.</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span> <tt class="ttfamily">C</tt></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is composed of <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leqslant T \leqslant 30$</span>), each on
    one line.</p>
<p>Each input line will consist of an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, followed by a string.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the amount of
    forward rotation, such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leqslant N \leqslant 27$</span>. The string is the message to
    be encrypted, and will consist of 1 to 40 characters, using
    only capital letters, underscores, and periods.</p>
<p>The end of the input will be denoted by a final line with
    only the number <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, display the “encrypted” message that
    results after being reversed and then shifted.</p>
