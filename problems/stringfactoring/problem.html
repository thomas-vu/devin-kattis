<p>Spotting patterns in seemingly random strings is a problem
    with many applications. E.g., in our efforts to understand the
    genome we investigate the structure of DNA strings. In data
    compression we are interested in finding repetitions, so the
    data can be represented more efficiently with pointers. Another
    plausible example arises from the area of artificial
    intelligence, as how to interpret information given to you in a
    language you do not know. The natural thing to do in order to
    decode the information message would be to look for repetitions
    in it. So if the SETI project (the Search for Extra Terrestrial
    Intelligence) ever get a signal in the H21-spectra, we need to
    know how to decompose it.</p>
<p>One way of capturing the redundancy of a string is to find
    its factoring. If two or more identical substrings <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> follow each other in a string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, we can represent this
    aprt of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> as the
    substring <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, enclosed by
    parentheses, raised to the power of the number of repetitions.
    E.g., the string <span class="tex2jax_process">$DOODOO$</span>
    can be factored as <span class="tex2jax_process">$(DOO)^2$</span>, but also as <span class="tex2jax_process">$(D(O)^2)^2$</span>. Naturally, the latter
    factoring is considered better since it cannot be factored any
    further. We say that a factoring is irreducible if it does not
    contain any consecutive repetition of a substring. A string may
    have several irreducible factorings, as seen by the example
    string <span class="tex2jax_process">$POPPOP$</span>. It can be
    factored as <span class="tex2jax_process">$(POP)^2$</span>, as
    well as <span class="tex2jax_process">$PO(P)^2OP$</span>. The
    first factoring has a shorter representation and motivates the
    following definition. The <em>weigh</em> of a factoring equals
    the number of characters in it, <em>excluding</em> the
    parentheses and the exponents. Thus the weight of <span class="tex2jax_process">$(POP)^2$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, whereas <span class="tex2jax_process">$PO(P)^2OP$</span> has weight <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>. A <em>maximal</em> facotring is a
    factoring with the smallest possible weight. It should be clear
    that a maximal factoring is always an irreducible one, but
    there may still be several maximal factorings. E.g.,Â the
    string <span class="tex2jax_process">$ABABA$</span> has two
    maximal factorings <span class="tex2jax_process">$(AB)^2A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$A(BA)^2$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line, containing a string of
    at least one, but at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> characters from the capital
    alphabet A-Z.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the weight of a maximal factoring of the input
    string.</p>
