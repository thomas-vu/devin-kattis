<p>Your wealthy friends love to brag about all their
    travelling. Every time you see them, they have visited some new
    exotic place you have never heard of. All of them are all too
    happy to tell you they have been <em>all</em> around the
    world—but you’re not so sure about that. Have these jetsetters
    made a real <em>circumnavigation</em>?</p>
<p>There exist many different definitions of what exactly
    constitutes a circumnavigation, but for the purposes of this
    problem we consider a circumnavigation a journey starting and
    ending at the same point and visiting all meridians (lines of
    longitude) along the way. Note that the North and South Pole
    are part of every meridian.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: Illustration of Sample Input 1, giving a
          circumnavigation starting and ending in Reykjavík, with
          additional waypoints in Athens, Jakarta, Honolulu and
          Chicago.

<p>Amelia, one of your rich friends, gave you a log of her
    flights in the form of a list of waypoints. Her trip started at
    the first waypoint, visited the remaining waypoints in order,
    and finally went back from the last waypoint to the first.
    Between consecutive waypoints, Amelia always travelled along
    the shortest circular arc connecting the two points. Find out
    whether Amelia’s trip can be considered a circumnavigation in
    the above sense, and if not find a meridian that Amelia never
    visited. In that case, always report exactly an integer-valued
    or half-integer-valued meridian.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>), the number
        of waypoints.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$\phi
        $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lambda
        $</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-90 &lt; \phi &lt;
        90, -180 \le \lambda &lt; 180$</span>), the latitude and
        longitude of one of the waypoints.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No two consecutive waypoints along the route are equal or
    antipodes (opposite points on the sphere) of each other.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the route is a valid circumnavigation, output <tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt>. Otherwise, output <tt class="ttfamily">no</tt>, followed by a longitude <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lambda $</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-180 \le \lambda &lt; 180$</span>) which the
    route never visited. The longitude must end in either
    <tt class="ttfamily">.0</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">.5</tt>.</p>
