<p>Your older brother is an amateur mathematician with lots of
    experience. However, his memory is very bad. He recently got
    interested in linear algebra over finite fields, but he does
    not remember exactly which finite fields exist. For you, this
    is an easy question: a finite field of order <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> exists if and only if <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> is a prime power, that is,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q = p^ k$</span> holds for some
    prime number <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and some
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k \geq 1$</span>.
    Furthermore, in that case the field is unique (up to
    isomorphism).</p>
<p>The conversation with your brother went something like
    this:</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>, satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq q \leq 10^9$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “<tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt>” if there exists a
    finite field of order <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>.
    Otherwise, output “<tt class="ttfamily">no</tt>”.</p>
