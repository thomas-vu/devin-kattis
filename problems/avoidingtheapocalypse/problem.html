<div class="problembody">
<p>You and the rest of your team are stuck in a town during the
    zombie apocalypse of 2020. You all might be infected with the
    virus and hence you will have to find your way to one of the
    medical facilities to get a cure before you also become
    zombies. Because you are scientists you quickly realize that it
    is safer to try and sneak your way past the zombies than to
    recklessly start fighting them. Obviously the zombies are
    everywhere so some streets might take more time to sneak
    through than others. It is also obvious that by splitting up
    into smaller groups it is easier to move around undetected.</p>
<p>Furthermore, since these zombies have not mutated to the
    extent that they actually have eyes in the back of their heads,
    it might be easy to cross some streets in one direction while
    hard or impossible to cross them in the other direction.</p>
<p>How many of you can sneak past all the zombies and get to a
    medical facility in time?</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span>): the
        number of locations in the town.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with three space-separated integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq g \leq 100$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s \leq 100$</span>):
        the starting location of your group, the number of people
        in it, and the number of time steps you have to get to the
        safety of a medical facility, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq n$</span>): the number of
        medical facilities in the town.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each
        with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x \leq n$</span>): the location
        of each of the medical facilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq r \leq 1\, 000$</span>): the
        number of roads in the town.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines, each
        with four space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a,b \leq n$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$a \neq b$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p \leq 100$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq t \leq
        100$</span>), indicating that there is a road from
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, which <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> people can enter at every time
        step and takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>
        timesteps to traverse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are at most two roads – one in each direction –
    between any pair of locations. The locations are safe enough to
    wait at for any amount of time and do not have a limit on the
    number of people that can be there.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a single integer: the largest number of
        people that can get to a medical facility in time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
