<p>Boredom can be good for creativity. Polish mathematician
    Stanislaw Ulam (1909-1984) discovered the eponymous Ulam spiral
    while listening to a “long and very boring paper”. He started
    by writing down the positive integers in a spiral on a grid,
    one number per grid cell. Then he eliminated the composite
    numbers (i.e. non-primes). An interesting property he
    discovered was that the remaining prime numbers seem to form
    along many diagonals of the grid:</p>

<p>Note that both of these are infinitely large grids, but due
    to physical constraints only a finite subset of the grid will
    fit in this space.</p>
<p>Let’s consider traveling around the second grid above (the
    Ulam spiral), where you are free to travel to any cell
    containing a composite number, but traveling to any cell
    containing a prime number is disallowed. You can travel up,
    down, left, or right, but not diagonally. Write a program to
    find the length of the shortest path between pairs composite
    numbers, if it is possible. Note, for example, that it is
    impossible to travel from the cells numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$72$</span> to any other composite cell. The
    length of a path is the number of steps on the path.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each test case is described by a line of input containing
    two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x, y \leq
    10\, 000$</span> which indicate two cells in the grid. Note
    that while there are limits on the input values, the
    intervening path between <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> is not limited in any way.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, display the case number followed by the
    length of the shortest path between the cells <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, or “impossible” if no such path
    is possible.</p>
