<div class="problembody">
<p>It’s that time of the year when students head back to
    school, which will usually involve moving lots of stuff, and
    packing lots of that stuff into boxes. However, before we go
    through that effort, it would be nice to know whether the boxes
    we have are the right size!</p>
<p>A box has three dimensions, <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>, and a box’s volume <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> is simply <span class="tex2jax_process">$l\cdot w \cdot h$</span>. We have many small
    items to pack, and we don’t care about their exact geometry: we
    know that, as long as a box has a volume of, at least,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathbf{V}$</span>, we will be
    able to pack all those items into that single box. So, given a
    box <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, and its volume
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span>, then the
    difference <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i=v_
    i-\mathbf{V}$</span> can tell us whether the box is big enough
    or not to pack all the items. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span> is greater than or equal to
    zero, the box is big enough; otherwise, the box is too
    small.</p>
<p>So, we want to answer a simple question: given multiple
    boxes, is the <em>largest</em> box (by volume) large enough to
    store all our items? For example, suppose <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathbf{V}=10$</span> and we have three
    boxes, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, with dimensions <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,1,2)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2,2,2)$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3,2,1)$</span>, respectively. Their volumes
    will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ A=2$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ B=8$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ C=6$</span>, which means the largest box
    is <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. Unfortunately,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ B=v_
    B-\mathbf{V}=8-10=-2$</span>, which means our largest box is
    not large enough.</p>
<p>On the other hand, suppose <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathbf{V}=980$</span>, and we had four
    boxes, <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z$</span> with dimensions <span class="tex2jax_process">$(10,10,10)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(10,5,2)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(5,3,2)$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(90,5,2)$</span>, respectively. Their
    volumes will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ W=1\,
    000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ X=100$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ Y=30$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ Z=900$</span>, making <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> the largest box and, since
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ W=v_ W-\mathbf{V}=1\,
    000-980=20$</span>, that means <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> is big enough for all our
    items.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input specifies a set of boxes. It begins with a line
    containing two integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 100$</span>), specifying the number of boxes, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathbf{V}$</span>, as defined
    above. The remaining input is composed of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each specifying one box.
    Each line contains the dimensions <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> for the box. You may assume that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leqslant l, w, h, \mathbf{V}
    &lt; 2^{32}$</span>. You may also assume that, for any given
    box <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, its volume
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> will always be less
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{32}$</span></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output is a single integer: the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span> for the largest box by
    volume.</p>
