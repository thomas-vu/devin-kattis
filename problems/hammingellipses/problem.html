<div class="problembody">
<p>In geometry, ellipses are defined by two focal points
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_1, f_2$</span> and a length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>. The ellipse consists
    of all points <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> such
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathop
    {\mathrm{distance}}(f_1, p) + \mathop {\mathrm{distance}}(f_2,
    p) = D$</span>.</p>
<p>When one normally thinks of ellipses, it is in the context
    of the Euclidean 2D plane, with the Euclidean distance as a
    distance measure.</p>
<p>This problem explores a different kind of ellipse. The space
    we will work in is the space of words of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> using an alphabet of <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> different symbols, often denoted
    as <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_ q^ n$</span>. As you can
    probably see, for given values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$q^ n$</span> different words (points) in the
    space <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_ q^ n$</span>.</p>
<p>For a distance measure, we use the <em>Hamming
    distance</em>. The Hamming distance between two words
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x, y \in F_ q^ n$</span> is
    simply the number of positions where the symbols that make up
    the words <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> differ. For example,
    the Hamming distance between words <tt class="ttfamily">01201</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">21210</tt> is 3
    because there are 3 positions where the words have different
    symbols. The Hamming distance between any two words in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_ q^ n$</span> will always be
    an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, inclusive.</p>
<p>Within the space <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_ q^
    n$</span>, we now define the <em>Hamming ellipse</em> as the
    set of all points <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> such
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathop
    {\mathrm{hammingdistance}}(f_1, p) + \mathop
    {\mathrm{hammingdistance}}(f_2, p) = D$</span>. Given values
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, focal points <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_2$</span> and distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>, we ask you to determine the
    number of points <span class="tex2jax_process">$p \in F_ q^
    n$</span> that lie on this Hamming ellipse.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le q \le 10$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100$</span>) and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le D \le 2 n$</span>).</p>
<p>The second and third lines specify the two focal points
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_2$</span>, each formatted as a string of
    length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> using digits
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 0, 1 \ldots q - 1\}
    $</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing a single integer, denoting the
    number of points on the ellipse.</p>
<p>The input is chosen such that the answer is less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{63}$</span>.</p>
