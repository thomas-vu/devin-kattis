<p>You are a stone-chiseler in Ancient Greece, charged with
    copying the text from famous monuments onto new stones. The
    existing inscriptions use <em>boustrophedon</em> writing, in
    which the lines of text alternate direction, and if a line ends
    in the middle of a word, the word simply continues on the next
    line. For example, an inscription may look like this:</p>
<pre>
IN.HONOR.OF.THE.INTERNAT
TEPMOC.GNIMMARGORP.LANOI
ITION
</pre>
<p>(In the original boustrophedon style, no spaces or
    punctuation were used between words, but here we have
    introduced periods between words.)</p>
<p>Today, however, you have been asked to copy these over into
    the new-fangled style where each line runs left to right, and
    words will not be split across lines â€” if there is not room for
    a whole word on a particular line, it will be started on the
    next line. So, the inscription above might instead look like
    this:</p>
<pre>
IN.HONOR.OF.THE
INTERNATIONAL
PROGRAMMING.COMPETITION
</pre>
<p>Of course, before you get started, you will need to know
    what size of stone will be required for your inscription. The
    width of the stone will be given, and the length for you to
    determine.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input will consist of three numbers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of lines
    in the original inscription, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, the width of the original
    inscription, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, the
    width of your new stone in characters. Then, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines follow containing the
    original inscription written in boustrophedon style. You may
    assume that the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> such lines consist only of
    capital letters and periods, with the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-th line also possibly containing
    spaces. You may assume that no two periods appear
    consecutively, that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n \leq
    100\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq d\leq
    100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq w\leq
    100$</span>, and that no word is more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> letters long.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should consist of a single integer, representing
    the number of lines required to write the inscription when
    writing left to right and not splitting words across lines.</p>
