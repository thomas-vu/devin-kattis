<p>Before bridges were common, ferries were used to transport
    cars across rivers. River ferries, unlike their larger cousins,
    run on a guide line and are powered by the riverâ€™s current.
    Cars drive onto the ferry from one end, the ferry crosses the
    river, and the cars exit from the other end of the ferry.</p>
<p>There is a ferry across the river that can take <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cars across the river in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> minutes and return in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> minutes. A car may
    arrive at either river bank to be transported by the ferry to
    the opposite bank. The ferry travels continuously back and
    forth between the banks so long it is carrying a car or there
    is at least one car waiting at either bank. Whenever the ferry
    arrives at one of the banks, it unloads its cargo and loads up
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cars that are
    waiting to cross. If there are more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, those that have been waiting the
    longest are loaded. If there are no cars waiting on either
    bank, the ferry waits until one arrives, loads it (if it
    arrives on the same bank of the ferry), and crosses the river.
    At what time does each car reach the other side of the
    river?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, the number of test cases. Each
    test case begins with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n, t,
    m$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
    follow, each giving the arrival time for a car (in minutes
    since the beginning of the day), and the bank at which the car
    arrives ("left" or "right").</p>
<p>You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; n,
    t, m \leq 10\, 000$</span>. The arrival times for each test
    case are non-decreasing. The ferry is initially on the left
    bank. Loading and unloading time may be considered to be 0.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line per car, in the same
    order as the input, giving the time at which that car is
    unloaded at the opposite bank. Output an empty line between
    cases.</p>
