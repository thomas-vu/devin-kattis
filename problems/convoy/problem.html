<p>You and your friends have gathered at your house to prepare
    for the Big Game, which you all plan to attend in the afternoon
    at the football stadium across town. The problem: you only have
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> cars between you, with
    each car seating five people (including the driver), so you
    might have to take multiple trips to get all <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> people to the stadium. In
    addition, some of your friends know the city better than
    others, and so take different amounts of time to drive to the
    stadium from your house. You’d like to procrastinate as long as
    possible before hitting the road: can you concoct a
    transportation plan that gets all people to the stadium in the
    shortest amount of time possible?</p>
<p>More specifically, each person <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> currently at your house can drive
    to the stadium in <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>
    minutes. All <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> cars are
    currently parked at your house. Any person can drive any car
    (so the cars are interchangeable). After a car arrives at the
    stadium, any person currently at the stadium can immediately
    start driving back to your house (and it takes person
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> the same amount of
    time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> to drive back
    as to drive to the stadium), or alternatively, cars can be
    temporarily or permanently parked at the stadium. Drivers
    driving to the stadium can take up to four passengers with
    them, but drivers driving back can <em>NOT</em> take any
    passenger. You care only about getting all <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> people from your house to the
    stadium—you do <em>NOT</em> need to park all <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> cars at the stadium, if doing so
    would require more time than an alternative plan that leaves
    some cars at your house.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq n,k \leq 20\, 000)$</span>, the
    number of people at your house and the number of available
    cars. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines containing a single integer each; the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th such integer is the number of
    seconds <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq t_ i \leq 1\, 000\,
    000)$</span> that it takes person <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to drive from your house to the
    stadium, or vice-versa.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the minimum number of seconds it takes to move all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> people from your house
    to the stadium, if all people coordinate and drive
    optimally.</p>
