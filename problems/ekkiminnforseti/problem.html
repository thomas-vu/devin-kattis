</div>After the 2016 United States Presidential election, a
    large group of people protested because they felt the president
    did not have the support of a majority of the population. The
    words “NOT MY PRESIDENT” were heard all over the country. In
    the election, Hillary Clinton receieved <span class="tex2jax_process">$48.2\% $</span> of the votes and Donald
    Trump received <span class="tex2jax_process">$46.1\% $</span>
    of the votes. Trump was victorious despite that because of the
    electoral system in the United States.
    <p>In Iceland it is impossible for a candidate with a lower
    amount of votes to win against the candidate with the most
    votes. Even though our electoral system is not susceptible to
    this flaw in particular, it is hardly perfect. In Iceland’s
    electoral system, a voter simply chooses a single candidate to
    vote for and the candidate with the highest number of votes
    wins.</p>
<p>Ólafur Þórður Harðarson, a professor of political science at
    the University of Iceland, has criticized Iceland’s electoral
    system for decades. In an old article, he wrote about one flaw
    in particular. He examined the possibility of an almost even
    distribution of votes between candidates. With two candidates,
    the winner would have to receive just over half of the votes in
    order to win, which makes the system seem as fair as it
    possibly can be. However, if there are ten candidates in the
    race, then it may be sufficient to receive just over
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\% $</span> of the votes to be
    elected. Since the voters’ first choice is the only thing that
    is taken into account, up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$90\% $</span> of the nation may be left with
    the candidate which they like the least as president.</p>
<p>Another flaw of the system, which is often criticized, is
    known as lost votes. It is often clear by the polls before the
    election, which two candidates are most likely to win. The
    difference between them and the third, fourth or even ninth
    place candidates can be so large that the poll clearly shows
    which candidates will be in the top two places. A voter may
    then feel their vote is lost since their vote will not impact
    the battle between the top two candidates. Some voters may even
    choose to vote for the candidate in the top two which they like
    the most, even though, in their mind, they may be voting for
    the lesser of two evils.</p>
<p>One solution to this issue would be to have multiple rounds
    of the electoral process so ensure each vote has an impact, but
    for a small nation like Iceland this can prove financially
    unviable. Luckily, a system exists which only requires one
    round and is free of the aforementioned flaws. The system is
    based on the voter ordering the candidates by their preference.
    The main flaw of this system then is that the voting process
    becomes a little more complicated for the voter. The first
    choice of each voter would then determine the initial result of
    the elections, which would be the same result as we obtain in
    the current system. The difference is that while no voter has a
    majority of the votes, the candidate with the lowest amount of
    votes is removed from the election. The votes for that
    candidate are then updated, and each voter’s next option
    receives the vote. When some candidate has a majority of the
    votes, the winner of the election has been determined.</p>
<p>The Competitive Programming Association of Iceland used
    their time machine to travel back to previous elections, asking
    every person in the country how they would vote in this new
    system. The association travelled back in time slowly, but
    surely, and everything went fine and dandy. Each voter provided
    an ordered list with all candidates listed. When it was time to
    travel back to the future, to the year <span class="tex2jax_process">$2023$</span>, it was revealed that the time
    machine did not work in both directions. The members of the
    association were therefore stuck in the year <span class="tex2jax_process">$1952$</span>, when there were not many
    computers to be found in Iceland. Therefore, they were unable
    to write a program to simulate the elections with the new
    votes. They decided to freeze themselves in order to reach the
    year <span class="tex2jax_process">$2023$</span> once more and
    Arnar left these instructions in the hope that someone would
    implement the program for him.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of votes,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, the number of
    candidates, which are separated by a space.</p>
<p>Next, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines follow,
    each of which contains the name of a candidate. Names consist
    entirely of letters from the English alphabet. The number of
    letters in each name is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    follow, each of which contains a vote. Each vote consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> integers, the numbers
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, where each number appears exactly
    once, and describes the order in which the voter prefers the
    candidates. The first number in the line therefore references
    the voter’s first choice candidates, the second number
    references the second choice and so forth. The numbers
    reference the candidates in the order which they appear in the
    input.</p>
<p>If two candidates have an equal amount of votes at any point
    in the process, then the candidate which appear earlier in the
    input is considered to be placed higher.</p>

<p>Output a single line with the name of the winner of the
    elections.</p>
