<p>A tug of war is to be arranged at the local office picnic.
    For the tug of war, the picnickers must be divided into two
    teams. Each person must be on one team or the other; the number
    of people on the two teams must not differ by more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>; the total weight of
    the people on each team should be as nearly equal as
    possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of people at the
    picnic. <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines follow.
    The first line gives the weight of person <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>; the second the weight of person
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>; and so on. Each
    weight is an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$450$</span>. There is at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> people at the picnic.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Your output will be a single line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> integers: the total weight of the
    people on one team, and the total weight of the people on the
    other team. If these numbers differ, give the lesser first.</p>
