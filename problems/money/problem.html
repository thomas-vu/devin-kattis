<div class="problembody">
<p>In this problem you will be solving one of the most profound
    challenges of humans across the world since the beginning of
    time – how to make lots of money.</p>
<p>You are a middleman in the widget market. Your job is to buy
    widgets from widget producer companies and sell them to widget
    consumer companies. Each widget consumer company has an open
    request for one widget per day, until some end date, and a
    price at which it is willing to buy the widgets. On the other
    hand, each widget producer company has a start date at which it
    can start delivering widgets and a price at which it will
    deliver each widget.</p>
<p>Due to fair competition laws, you can sign a contract with
    only one producer company and only one consumer company. You
    will buy widgets from the producer company, one per day,
    starting on the day it can start delivering, and ending on the
    date specified by the consumer company. On each of those days
    you earn the difference between the producer’s selling price
    and the consumer’s buying price.</p>
<p>Your goal is to choose the consumer company and the producer
    company that will maximize your profits.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq m, n \leq 500\, 000$</span>) denoting the number of
    producer and consumer companies in the market, respectively. It
    is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines,
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> of
    which contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p_ i, d_ i \leq
    10^9$</span>), the price (in dollars) at which the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> producer sells one
    widget and the day on which the first widget will be available
    from this company. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{\text {th}}$</span> of which contains two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_ j$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_ j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq q_ j, e_ j \leq 10^9$</span>), the
    price (in dollars) at which the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{\text {th}}$</span> consumer is willing
    to buy widgets and the day immediately after the day on which
    the last widget has to be delivered to this company.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the maximum total number of dollars you can earn. If
    there is no way to sign contracts that gives you any profit,
    display <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>.</p>
