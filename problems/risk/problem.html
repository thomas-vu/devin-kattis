<p>Risk is a board game played on a world map. This world is
    divided into regions by borders. Each region is controlled by a
    player (either you or one of your opponents). Any region that
    you control contains a positive number of your armies.</p>
<p>In each turn, you are allowed to move your armies. Each of
    your armies may either stay where it is, or move from a region
    to a bordering region under your control. The movements are
    performed one by one, in an order of your choice. At all times,
    each region must contain at least one army.</p>
<p>For strategic purposes, it is important to move your armies
    to regions that border your opponents’ regions and minimize the
    number of armies on your regions that are totally surrounded by
    other regions under your control. You want your weakest link,
    i.e., the border region with the minimum number of armies, to
    be as strong as possible. What is the maximum number of armies
    that can be placed on it after one turn?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line a positive integer: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le n\le 100$</span>): the number of
        regions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$(0\le a_ i\le 100)$</span>:
        the number of your armies on each region. A number
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> indicates that a
        region is controlled by your opponents, while a positive
        number indicates that it is under your control.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines with
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> characters, where
        each character is either ‘<tt class="ttfamily">Y</tt>’ or
        ‘<tt class="ttfamily">N</tt>’. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th character of the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th line is
        ‘<tt class="ttfamily">Y</tt>’ if regions <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> border, and ‘<tt class="ttfamily">N</tt>’ otherwise. This relationship is
        symmetric and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th character of the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line will
        always be ‘<tt class="ttfamily">N</tt>’.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In every test case, you control at least one region, and
    your opponents control at least one region. Furthermore, at
    least one of your regions borders at least one of your
    opponents’ regions.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an integer: the maximum number of armies
        on your weakest border region after one turn of moving.</p>
</li>
