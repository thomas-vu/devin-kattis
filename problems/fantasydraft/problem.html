<div class="problembody">
<p>In fantasy hockey, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> team owners that each selects
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> hockey players. To
    determine which owner gets which players, the owners hold a
    draft.</p>
<p>The draft proceeds as follows: the first owner may select
    any player, then the second owner can select any player except
    the player taken first and so on. In general, the current owner
    may take any player that has not been taken previously. Once
    all owners have selected one player, they repeat this process
    until all owners have selected <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> players. No player may be selected
    by multiple teams.</p>
<p>Initially, all players are given a ranking based on how well
    they played in the previous year. However, the owners may not
    agree with this order. For example, the first owner may believe
    that the player which was ranked third in the previous year is
    the best player and would prefer to take them.</p>
<p>Each owner has a preference list. On their turn, the owner
    selects the player that is the highest available player on
    their own preference list. If all players on their preference
    list are taken, then they resort to using the ordering from the
    previous year.</p>
<p>Given the preference list of each owner and the rankings
    from the previous year, which players did each owner get?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 60$</span>), the number of
    owners, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq 1\, 000$</span>),
    the size of each team.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    contain owners’ preferences in the order of drafting. Each line
    starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_
    i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq q_ i \leq 1\,
    500$</span>), the size of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> owners’ preference
    list. <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_ i$</span> names follow,
    separated by spaces, in order of <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> owner’s preference.
    No name appears more than once in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> owners’ list.</p>
<p>The next line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$n
    \cdot k \leq p \leq 65\, 000$</span>), indicating the number of
    players in the draft.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> lines each
    contain a single name, they are ordered by their previous
    year’s ranking. Each player name is unique and comprised of at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> letters of
    English alphabet.</p>
<p>The names in owners’ preference lists are guaranteed to
    appear in the player list.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> of which
    contains the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> names of
    the players that were selected by the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> owner. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> teams should be in the
    original order of owners and players should be listed in the
    order in which they were drafted following the rules above.</p>
