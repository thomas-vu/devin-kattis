<p>A brokerage firm is interested in detecting automatic
    trading. They believe that a particular algorithm repeats
    itself; that is, it makes the same sequence of trades at a
    later time. The firm has identified a set of 26 key stocks that
    they believe are likely to be traded in concert, and theyâ€™ve
    encoded a series of trades as a string of letters: the letter
    itself indicates the stock, upper case indicates a buy, lower
    case indicates a sell. They want you to write a program to
    determine, for any two starting points, the longest sequence of
    identical trades from those two starting points, starting from
    and including those starting points as the first trade in the
    sequence.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There will be a single test case in the input. This test
    case will start with a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> on the first line, consisting
    solely of upper case and lower case letters (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le \text {length}(s) \le 100\,
    000$</span>). On the next line will be an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le q \le 100\, 000$</span>), indicating the number of queries.
    The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines
    each describe a query with two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le i &lt; j &lt; \text {length}(s)$</span>), which represent
    two zero-based positions in the string.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query, output a single integer, indicating the
    length of the longest sequence of trades starting at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> which is identical to
    the sequence of trades starting at <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
