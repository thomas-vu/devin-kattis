<p>Congratulations! You are starting your internship for the
    famous digital archaeologist, Endiana Jones. You have been
    assigned to evaluate the results of saved games of a 1980’s
    version of Tic-Tac-Toe. In those days, programmers had very
    little storage, so they saved game state as compactly as
    possible. In this case, the state was in a 32-bit register.
    Bits <span class="tex2jax_process">$0-8$</span> stored the
    positions that had been played and bits <span class="tex2jax_process">$9-17$</span> indicated an X or O. A set bit
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> bit) indicated a
    played position for bits <span class="tex2jax_process">$0-8$</span> or that X played for bits
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9-17$</span>. Bit 18 indicated
    the next player to play. (Bits are numbered from right to left,
    starting at the least-significant bit.) If bit <span class="tex2jax_process">$18$</span> is set (is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>), it is X’s turn to play next.
    Visually the bits were laid out as shown in Figure 1:</p>

</div>
<p>The game represented by the picture would have bits
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0-8$</span> set because all
    positions have been played. Bits <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> would be set because those
    positions contain an X. Bit <span class="tex2jax_process">$18$</span> would be set because it would be
    X’s turn next. The state would be represented in binary as:
    <tt class="ttfamily">1 001 001 110 111 111 111</tt> or in octal
    as <span class="tex2jax_process">$01116777$</span>.</p>
<p>The Tic-Tac-Toe implementation was very simple, and a cat’s
    game (draw or tie) was not called until all positions had been
    played. Your task is to interpret the state of the game given
    an <b class="bfseries">octal</b> integer.</p>
<p><b class="bfseries">Quick review of Tic-Tac-Toe:</b> Two
    players play the game. Either player may go first. One player’s
    mark is X and the other’s is O. Each player takes turns placing
    their mark in one of the empty squares. If a player gets three
    marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row, that player
    wins. If there is no winner and there are no empty spaces left,
    the game stops, and the game is declared “Cat’s” game.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of a single decimal integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq c \leq 10\, 000$</span>), the number
    of states to evaluate. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> lines will have a single <b class="bfseries">octal</b> number representing the state of a game.
    All numbers will follow the convention of writing octal numbers
    with a leading <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. All
    game states will be legal, that is, achievable in a real game
    of Tic-Tac-Toe.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each game state number print a single line indicating
    the state of the game. The four possible output lines are:</p>
<pre>
X wins
O wins
Cat's
In progress
</pre>
