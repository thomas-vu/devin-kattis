<p>The Chimera Ants are building their own kingdom!</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> ants
    numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Each ant is
    responsible for kingdom construction in a rectangular region.
    More precisely, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    ant is assigned a rectangular region in Cartesian plane, with
    edges parallel to the two axes, and opposite corners at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i, y_ i)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(u_ i, v_ i)$</span>.</p>
<p>Some regions or parts of some regions might be assigned to
    multiple ants. Usually, this would pose no problem: when two
    ants disagree, all the ants assigned to this region will vote
    for the two options, and the option with more votes will be
    implemented. However, this method does not work if a non-zero,
    even number of ants are assigned to a region, as the voting
    result may be a tie. The ants would like to know what are the
    total area of such region. Please help them!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le n \le 10^5)$</span>.</p>
<p>In the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> line,
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(-10^9 \le x_ i, y_ i, u_ i, v_ i \le
    10^9)$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i, y_
    i)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(u_ i, v_
    i)$</span> are the coordinates of the two opposite corners of
    the rectangular region assigned to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th ant.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single integer — the total area assigned to a
    positive even number of ants.</p>
