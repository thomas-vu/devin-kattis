<p>GigantoCorp has a problem. They have removed all tape drives
    from their data center and are doing all of their backups to
    disk storage. However, they seem to have used more disk space
    than their backup software indicates should be in use. They
    think that there are files on the backup storage that are not
    in the backup software index. They would like your team to
    write a program to determine if there are“orphan” files on the
    backup storage that are not in the index or “orphan” index
    entries that have no corresponding files on the backup
    storage.</p>
<p>Your program will be provided with two lists – an index of
    valid backup image names, followed by a list of backup file
    names.</p>
<p>Your program is to compare the two lists and determine if
    there are either backup images in the index that have with no
    files or files that are not associated with any backup image in
    the index.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input is structured in two blocks.</p>
<p>The first is a list of backup images, one per line. Each
    backup image name consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span> printable ASCII characters (no
    spaces). There may be up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> images. Each image name is
    unique, and they may occur in any order.</p>
<p>The end of this block is signaled by an empty line.</p>
<p>The second block contains a list of backup file names, one
    per line, left justified. A backup file name has the format</p>
<p><i class="itshape">imageName</i>_<i class="itshape">integer</i>_<i class="itshape">type</i></p>
<p>where <i class="itshape">imageName</i> is a backup image
    name in the format described above, <i class="itshape">integer</i> is an integer in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\ldots 2\, 000\, 000\, 000$</span> denoting
    the time in seconds since January 1, 1970 at 00:00 GMT (the
    “UNIX epoch”), and <i class="itshape">type</i> is an uppercase
    English alphabetic character string of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> characters. There may be up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$300\, 000$</span> backup file
    names. File names are unique, and they may occur in any
    order.</p>
<p>The end of the second block is signaled by the end of
    file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>First, print the list of files with no index entries, one
    per line, by printing the character “F”, a single space, and
    then the file name.</p>
<p>After all the orphan files are printed, print the orphan
    index entries one per line by printing the character “I”, a
    single space, and then the backup image name.</p>
<p>Entries in each list are to be printed in ASCII
    lexicographic order.</p>
<p>If every file has an index entry and every index entry has
    one or more files, print only a line containing the string “No
    mismatches.”.</p>
