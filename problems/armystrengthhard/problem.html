<p><em>Note that this is a harder version of the problem
    armystrengtheasy.</em></p>
<p>The next MechaGodzilla invasion is on its way to Earth. And
    once again, Earth will be the battleground for an epic war.
    MechaGodzilla’s army consists of many nasty alien monsters,
    such as Space Godzilla, King Gidorah, and MechaGodzilla
    herself. To stop them and defend Earth, Godzilla and her
    friends are preparing for the battle.</p>
<p>Each army consists of many different monsters. Each monster
    has a strength that can be described by a positive integer. The
    larger the value, the stronger the monster. The war will
    consist of a series of battles. In each battle, the weakest of
    all the monsters that are still alive is killed. If there are
    several weakest monsters, but all of them in the same army, one
    of them is killed at random. If both armies have at least one
    of the weakest monsters, a random weakest monster of
    MechaGodzilla’s army is killed. The war is over if in one of
    the armies all monsters are dead. The dead army lost, the other
    one won. You are given the strengths of all the monsters. Find
    out who wins the war.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input file contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T\leq 50$</span> specifying the
    number of test cases. Each test case is preceded by a blank
    line.</p>
<p>Each test case starts with line containing two positive
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_ G$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_ M$</span> – the number of
    monsters in Godzilla’s and in MechaGodzilla’s army. You can
    assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_ G, N_ M\leq 100\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<p>Two lines follow. The first one contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_ G$</span> positive integers – the
    strengths of the monsters in Godzilla’s army. Similarly, the
    second one contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_ M$</span>
    positive integers – the strengths of the monsters in
    MechaGodzilla’s army. All strengths are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line with a string that
    describes the outcome of the battle. If it is sure that
    Godzilla’s army wins, output the string “<tt class="tt">Godzilla</tt>”. If it is sure that MechaGodzilla’s army
    wins, output the string “<tt class="tt">MechaGodzilla</tt>”.
    Otherwise, output the string “<tt class="tt">uncertain</tt>”.</p>
