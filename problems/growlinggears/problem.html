<p>The <em>Best Acceleration Production Company</em>
    specializes in multi-gear engines. The performance of an engine
    in a certain gear, measured in the amount of torque produced,
    is not constant: the amount of torque depends on the RPM of the
    engine. This relationship can be described using a
    <em>torque-RPM curve</em>.</p>

          1</b>: The torque-RPM curve of the gears given in the
          second sample input. The second gear can produce the
          highest torque.</span>

</div>
<p>For the latest line of engines, the torque-RPM curve of all
    gears in the engine is a parabola of the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$T = -aR^2 + bR + c$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> is the RPM of the
    engine, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> is the
    resulting torque.</p>
<p>Given the parabolas describing all gears in an engine,
    determine the gear in which the highest torque is produced. The
    first gear is gear 1, the second gear is gear 2, etc. There
    will be only one gear that produces the highest torque: all
    test cases are such that the maximum torque is at least 1
    higher than the maximum torque in all the other gears.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10$</span>): the number of
        gears in the engine.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        with three space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a,b,c \leq 10\, 000$</span>): the
        parameters of the parabola <span class="tex2jax_process">$T
        = -aR^2 + bR + c$</span> describing the torque-RPM curve of
        each engine.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a single integer: the gear in which the
        maximum torque is generated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
