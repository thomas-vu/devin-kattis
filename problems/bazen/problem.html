<p>Mirko and Slavko have built a grand new pool in front of
    their weekend getaway. The pool is an isosceles right triangle,
    with legs of length 250.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p>Everything was perfect, girls were coming, the DJ was
    coming, and the parties were wild. But, a problem arose when
    they started serving food at the parties. Mirko is vegetarian,
    while Slavko thinks a party without sausages is no party at
    all. Therefore they had to divide the pool into two parts. The
    pool is placed into a coordinate system (as in the figure
    above) and divided into two parts of equal area by a line
    segment with both endpoints on the edges of the pool.</p>
<p>Write a program that, given one endpoint of the dividing
    line segment, calculates the coordinates of the other
    endpoint.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers, the coordinates of one
    endpoint of the dividing line segment. That point will be on
    one of the edges of the pool.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the coordinates of the other endpoint, rounded to two
    decimal digits.</p>
