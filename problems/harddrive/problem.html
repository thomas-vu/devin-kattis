<p>Pia is getting ready for her flight to the NWERC 2018 in
    Eindhoven. As she is packing her hard drive, she remembers the
    airline’s ridiculous weight restrictions, which may pose a
    problem. You see, the hard drive is essentially a string of
    ones and zeros, and its weight depends on the number of “bit
    changes” in it: for any two adjacent bits storing two different
    values, the hard drive gets slightly heavier, so Pia cannot
    just store arbitrary information on it.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, the drive is so old that some bits
    are already broken and will always store zeros. The first bit
    will never be broken, but the last bit will always be.</p>
<p>Pia decides to treat this situation as a challenge: she is
    now trying to modify the information on the hard drive so that
    it has exactly the maximum number of bit changes permitted by
    the airline. However, the broken bits make this harder than
    expected, so she needs your help.</p>
<p>Find a bit pattern which can be stored on the hard drive and
    has exactly the desired number of bit changes.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 5\cdot 10^5$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq c, b \le
        n-1$</span>), the size of the hard drive in bits, the
        desired amount of bit changes, and the number of broken
        bits. The positions on the hard drive are numbered from
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$z_1, \ldots , z_
        b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq z_1 &lt;
        z_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; z_ b = n$</span>), the positions of
        the broken bits on the hard drive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a bit string of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, representing Pia’s hard drive and
    containing exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> bit
    changes. If there are multiple valid solutions, you may output
    any one of them. It is guaranteed that at least one solution
    exists.</p>
