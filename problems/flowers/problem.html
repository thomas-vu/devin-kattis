<div class="problembody">
<p>Tom and Sarah soon have their second anniversary and he
    wants to buy her something special. Even though she’s very keen
    on any kind of tree, he thinks that this probably is too big of
    a gift. So, he decides to buy her flowers. But not the lame cut
    off ones that will die after two weeks tops. No, he wants to
    buy her flowers that may last forever. Flowers in a flower pot.
    Now, he has a problem. Finding the right flowers for his
    girlfriend isn’t that difficult. However, finding the right
    flower pot turns out to be much more complicated. Since he
    wants the flowers to live as long as possible, he needs to find
    the best-fitting flower pot he can find. When he comes to the
    Arboreal and Crops Market, he notices that for each bouquet of
    flowers there is an optimal size written for the flower pot.
    However, the offered flower pots do not state their volume. The
    only information the shop assistant can provide is the outline
    of each flower pot given as a function. Since Tom was never
    very good in math and his date is in less than an hour, he asks
    a nearby customer for help: You. Fortunately, you brought your
    laptop on your shopping tour. Can you help Tom?</p>
<p>The outline of a flower pot is described by a function
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(x) = a \cdot e^{-x^2} + b
    \cdot \sqrt {x}$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is the vertical distance from the
    bottom of the flower pot. The body of the flower pot thus is
    defined by the rotational body created when rotating the graph
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> around the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis. The height of a
    flower pot is denoted by <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>.</p>
<p>The volumes of two flower pots differ at least by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span>. Also there is
    only one flower pot closer to the optimal than any other one,
    with an accuracy to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input always contains one test case which consists of
    several lines.</p>
<p>The first line contains a decimal number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; V \le 10^5$</span>, the optimal size
    for Tom’s favorite flower, and an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; N \le 5$</span>, the number of flower
    pots available.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each
    contain three decimal numbers describing the corresponding
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>th flower pot:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le a_ k \le 10$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le b_ k \le 10$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le h_ k \le 10$</span>.</p>
<p>For the sample input the volumes are approximately
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$34.72348$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$21.77966$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print one line containing a single integer that describes
    the index of the best fitting flower pot. The index of the
    first flower pot is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
