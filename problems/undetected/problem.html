<p>The Department of Defense has been designing autonomous
    robots that can infiltrate war zones and other hostile places
    in order to carry out missions. Now they want to test their
    latest design, the Penetrator1700, and theyâ€™ve hired you to
    help design the test environment.</p>
<p>The test environment is a rectangular field with some
    sensors placed within the field. Each sensor has a certain
    radius defining the region within which it can detect a robot.
    You want to design the field to have as many sensors as
    possible while still permitting a route across the field that
    avoids detection.</p>
<p>The field is a region of the coordinate plane defined by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq x \leq 200$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq y \leq 300$</span>. The
    robot can be modeled by a point that must remain on the field
    at all times. It starts at the bottom of the field
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$y = 0$</span>) and must end at
    the top of the field (<span class="tex2jax_process">$y =
    300$</span>), and must not pass within range of any sensor.
    There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> sensor
    locations given by triples <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,
    y, r)$</span> of integers, where each <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span> is a point on the field, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is its radius of
    detection. The implied sensor circles may overlap, but will
    never be tangent with each other nor with the boundary of the
    field. All sensors are initially inactive. You must find the
    largest value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> such
    that if sensors <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, 3, \ldots
    , k$</span> are activated there is a path for the robot across
    the field, but no path if the (<span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>+1)st sensor is also activated. It
    is guaranteed that there is no path if all <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> sensors are activated.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \leq 200$</span>. Each of the next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines has three
    space-separated integers, representing <span class="tex2jax_process">$x, y, r$</span> for a sensor, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r \leq 300$</span>. All sensors
    lie at different <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span>
    positions. The first three sample inputs below correspond to
    the figure shown.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer (which may be <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>) giving the largest <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> as described above.</p>
