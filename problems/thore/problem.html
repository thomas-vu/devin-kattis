</div>Thore Husfeldt likes to compare his time on solved Kattis
    problems with other people. If he has written the fastest
    solution on a problem he screams “I’m amazing” in pure joy.
    However if his solution is not the fastest he likes to find out
    if he is the best Thore, or maybe the best ThoreH on the
    scoreboard. He is the best ThoreH if there is another Thore
    above him, but no ThoreH above him. Once a terrible incident
    took place where Thore misread the scoreboard and thought that
    he was the best, but instead it was some other Thore who was
    amazing. Now he needs your help to find the smallest prefix
    that uniquely determines himself on the scoreboard.
    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 &lt; n \leq 100$</span>.</p>
<p>Then follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    with a name on each line.</p>
<p>Each name only contains characters from the set <span class="tex2jax_process">$\big [\text {a-zA-Z}\big ]$</span>, i.e.
    lower and upper case English letters. Each name is at least one
    character and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters long.</p>
<p>Exactly one name is “ThoreHusfeldt” in the input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output is a single line. If “ThoreHusfeldt” is first on
    the scoreboard, output “Thore is awesome”. If another person,
    with a name containing “ThoreHusfeld”(note: no trailing “t”) as
    a prefix is above Thore, output “Thore sucks”.</p>
<p>Otherwise output the smallest prefix that uniquely
    determines Thore on the scoreboard from the top. In other
    words: find the smallest prefix of “ThoreHusfeldt” that no-one
    above “ThoreHusfeldt” shares.</p>
<h2>Sample Explanation</h2>
<p>In Sample Input <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    there is another Thore above “ThoreHusfeldt”. However,
    “ThoreHusfeldt” is still the best “ThoreH”.</p>
