<p>The following grammar describes a textual notation for a
    tree with (not necessarily unique) vertex labels:</p>
<pre>
   tree ::= label
   tree ::= label ( subtrees )
   subtrees ::= tree
   subtrees ::= subtrees , tree
   label ::= A | B | C | ... | Z
</pre>
<p>That is, the representation of a tree consists of a label
    (which is an uppercase letter) or a label followed by a
    bracketed ordered list of trees separated by commas.</p>
<p>In order to draw such a tree on paper, we must write each
    label on the page, such that the labels for the subtrees of a
    vertex are positioned counter-clockwise about the vertex. The
    labels must be positioned such that non-intersecting line
    segments connect each vertex to each of its subtrees. That is
    to say, we draw the normal planar representation of the tree,
    preserving the order of subtrees. Beyond these constraints, the
    position, shape, and size of the representation is
    arbitrary.</p>
<p>For example, a possible graphical representation for
    <tt class="ttfamily">A(B(C,D),E)</tt> is shown in
    Figure 1.</p>

<p>Given the textual representation for two trees, you are to
    determine whether or not they are equivalent. That is, do they
    share a common paper representation?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$t \le 400$</span>, the number of test cases.
    Each test case consists of two lines, each specifying a tree in
    the notation described above. Each line will contain at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> characters, and no
    white space.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing “same” or
    “different” as appropriate.</p>
