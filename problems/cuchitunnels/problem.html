<p>The tunnels of Cu Chi are an immense network of underground
    tunnels connecting rooms located in the Cu Chi District of Ho
    Chi Minh City. The Cu Chi tunnels were the location of several
    military campaigns in the 1960s. Nowadays, it is a popular
    tourist destination.</p>
<p>There are documents from trusted sources about a private
    network of tunnels in this area used by a secret forces unit
    but it has not been discovered. According to the documents,
    this private network has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> rooms (numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>) connected by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> bidirectional tunnels. Room
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is the entry point
    from the ground surface to this underground network. From room
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, you can follow the
    tunnels to go to any of the rooms. The rooms are numbered in
    such a way that, if you follow the shortest path from room
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to any room
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, the sequence of
    visited roomsâ€™ indices will be increasing. The image below
    shows a valid map of this network.</p>

<p>The network below is invalid, since the path from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> - <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> - <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> - <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, which is not increasing:</p>

</center>
<p>There is also an old article from an unknown source
    mentioning about <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ i$</span>
    which is the number of rooms directly connected to room
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
<p>Given an array <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> of
    size <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, your task is to
    verify if it is possible to have such a network.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> - the number of rooms in the
        network <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2 \leq N \leq 1\,
        000)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second line consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ i$</span> - the number of rooms that
        are directly connected to room <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq D_ i \leq N - 1)$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print <i class="itshape">YES</i>/<i class="itshape">NO</i>
    if it is possible/impossible to have such a network,
    respectively.</p>
