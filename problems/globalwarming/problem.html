<div class="problembody">
<p>This is a very exciting week for John. The reason is that,
    as a middle school teacher, he has been asked to dedicate the
    entire week to teaching his class of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> students about the cause and
    effect of global warming. As John is very passionate about his
    planet, he’s going to spend extra time and effort to make this
    week memorable and rewarding for the students. Towards that,
    one of the things he wants to ask them to do is to prepare, as
    homework, presentations about global warming. To make this a
    little easier for them, as well as more fun, he has asked them
    to do this in groups of two.</p>
<p>Of course arranging the students into groups comes with the
    usual headache, namely that only friends are willing to work
    together. Luckily the students in his class are a friendly
    bunch. In particular, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> are three distinct students, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> are friends, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> are friends, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> are also friends. But John now
    realizes the irony in asking his students to work at home in
    groups, as students may have to travel to meet their group
    partner, which may emit greenhouse gases such as carbon
    dioxide, depending on their mode of transportation. In the
    spirit of this week’s topic, John asked all the students in his
    class to calculate, for each of their friends, how much carbon
    dioxide would be emitted if they were to meet up with the
    respective friend.</p>
<p>Using this information, can you help John figure out what is
    the minimum total amount of carbon dioxide that will be emitted
    if he arranges the groups optimally, or determine that it’s not
    possible to arrange all the students into groups of two
    friends?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 200$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq
    m \leq 250$</span>), the number of students in John’s class,
    and the total number of pairs of friends in the class. As John
    is bad with names, he has given each of his students a distinct
    integer identifier between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq p, q \leq n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq
    c \leq 10^6$</span>), the identifiers of two distinct students
    that are friends, and how many grams of carbon dioxide would be
    emitted if they were in a group together, and thus had to meet.
    Each pair of friends is listed exactly once in the input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum total amount of carbon dioxide, in grams,
    that would be emitted if John arranges all students optimally
    into groups of two friends, or “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>” if there is no way to arrange the
    students into groups in that way.</p>
