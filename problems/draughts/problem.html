<div class="problembody">
<p><em>Draughts</em> (Or <em>checkers</em>) is a game played by
    two opponents, on opposite sides of a <span class="tex2jax_process">$10 \times 10$</span> board. The board
    squares are painted black and white, as on a classic
    chessboard. One player controls the dark, and the other the
    light pieces. The pieces can only occupy the black squares. The
    players make their moves alternately, each moving one of his
    own pieces.</p>
<p>The most interesting type of move is <em>capturing</em>: if
    a diagonally adjacent square contains an opponent’s piece, it
    may be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it
    to the unoccupied square immediately beyond it. It is allowed
    to make several consecutive captures in one move, if they are
    all made with a single piece. It is also legal to capture by
    either forward or backward jumps.</p>

<p>You are given a draughts position. It is the light player’s
    turn. Compute the maximal possible number of dark pieces he can
    capture in his next move.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the number of test cases
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>. The descriptions of
    the test cases follow:</p>
<p>Each test case starts with an empty line. The following 10
    lines of 10 characters each describe the board squares. The
    characters <tt class="ttfamily">#</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">.</tt> denote empty black and white squares,
    <tt class="ttfamily">W</tt> denotes a square with a light
    piece, <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>—a square with a dark
    piece.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case print a single line containing the
    maximal possible number of captures. If there is no legal move
    (for example, there are no light pieces on the board), simply
    output 0.</p>
