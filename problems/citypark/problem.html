<p>Porto is blessed with a beautiful city park. The park, in
    the western section of the city, borders the Atlantic Ocean. It
    has great lawns, small forests, plenty of flowerbeds, a variety
    of ponds, and, in all, lots of points of interest. Porto
    families love the park and flock to in on weekends and
    holidays.</p>
<p>With such multitudes, it is hard work to keep the lawns in
    good shape. In order to control the movements of the crowd, the
    engineers of the municipality designed a system of paths
    connecting points of interest. These paths are built with large
    rectangular shale stones from the nearby Milhária quarry. Using
    sophisticated location systems, the engineers were able to lay
    the stones perfectly aligned with the north-south direction
    (and hence also with the east-west direction). Stones linking
    one from one point of interest to another touch each other,
    forming a contiguous stoned surface, and do not touch any
    stones belonging to any other stoned surface.</p>
<p>The “defend our park” movement wants to stage a
    demonstration in the park to publicise their cause. Since they
    do not want to harm the lawns, they must stage the
    demonstration in one of those stoned surfaces. In order to
    summon as many supporters as possible, but not too many, they
    need to find out the area of the stoned surface with largest
    area.</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>Given the locations and dimensions of stones in the park,
    compute the area of the stoned surface with the largest
    area.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains one positive integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, representing the number of
    rectangular stones. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines follow, each one describing the location and dimensions
    of a stone, by four integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$(X,Y)$</span> are the coordinates of the
    location of the lower left corner the stone, <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> is its length along the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> is its length along the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-axis.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<table cellspacing="0" class="tabular">
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; N \leq 50\,
          000$</span></p>

          H \leq 500$</span></p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">

<p>It is guaranteed that, for the given inputs, the coordinates
    of the stone corners can be handled using normal 32-bit signed
    integers, as well as the total area of any stoned surface. For
    every pair of distinct stones, the area of the intersection of
    the two rectangles that represent them in the park is zero
    (i.e., there are no overlaps).</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>A single line with an integer: the area of the stoned
    surface with largest area.</p>
<h3>Sample Output Explanation</h3>
<p>The following figure represents the configuration of stones
    described in the sample input.</p>

<p>There are 4 stoned surfaces: one made up by stones 3 and 4,
    on the left, with area 16; another, made up by stones 7 and 1,
    with area 20; a third one, below the previous, made up by
    stones 0, 2 and 6, with area 15; and the one on the right, made
    up by stone 5 only, with area 16. The largest area is 20.</p>
