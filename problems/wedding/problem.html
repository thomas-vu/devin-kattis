<div class="problembody">
<p>Up to thirty couples will attend a wedding feast, at which
    they will be seated on either side of a long table. The bride
    and groom sit at one end, opposite each other, and the bride
    wears an elaborate headdress that keeps her from seeing people
    on the same side as her. It is considered bad luck to have a
    husband and wife seated on the same side of the table.
    Additionally, there are several pairs of people conducting
    adulterous relationships (both different-sex and same-sex
    relationships are possible), and it is bad luck for the bride
    to see both members of such a pair. Your job is to arrange
    people at the table so as to avoid any bad luck.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each test case gives <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 30$</span>), the number of couples, followed by the
    number of adulterous pairs <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq m \leq 50$</span>), followed by the pairs, in the form
    “<span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>h <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>w” (husband from couple
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, wife from couple
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>), or “<span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>w <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>w”, or “<span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>h <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>h”. Couples are numbered from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> with the bride and groom being
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>w and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>h.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, output a single line containing a list of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> people that should
    be seated on the same side as the bride. If there are several
    solutions, any one will do. If there is no solution, output a
    line containing <tt class="ttfamily">bad luck</tt>.</p>
