<p><em>Wordle</em> is a single-player word-guessing computer
    game developed by Josh Wardle, and later purchased by <em>The
    New York Times</em>. In each Wordle game instance, the player
    is given six attempts to guess a secret <span class="tex2jax_process">$5\textrm{-letter}$</span> word. On each
    attempt, the player simply enters a <span class="tex2jax_process">$5\textrm{-letter}$</span> guess (which must
    be a real <span class="tex2jax_process">$5\textrm{-letter}$</span> word), and then
    the game gives feedback about the correctness of the guess by
    assigning a colour to each letter in the guess as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>if the letter appears in the secret word in the same
        position, it is assigned green</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if the letter appears in the secret word, but not in the
        same position, it is assigned yellow</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if the letter does not appear in the secret word, it is
        assigned gray</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is one situation that requires a refinement of the
    above feedback rule. Suppose a letter appears <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> times in the secret word, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> times in the guess,
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x &lt; y$</span>.
    And suppose <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> of the
    occurrences of the letter in the guess are assigned green
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(\textrm{clearly }g &lt;
    y)$</span>. Then there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$y-g$</span> remaining occurrences of the
    letter in the guess, but only <span class="tex2jax_process">$x-g$</span> remaining occurrences of the
    letter in the secret word. Wordle will colour the
    <em>leftmost</em> <span class="tex2jax_process">$x-g$</span> of
    these <span class="tex2jax_process">$y-g$</span> occurrences in
    the guess yellow, and the rest gray. For an example of this
    situation, see Sample Input/Output 3.</p>
<p>Given a secret word and a guess, determine the resulting
    Wordle feedback.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two lines, the first of which contains
    a secret word, and the second of which contains a guess. Each
    is a string of <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>
    uppercase English letters (<tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>–<tt class="ttfamily">Z</tt>). Even though
    Wordle stipulates that secret words and guesses must be real
    words, for the purpose of this problem the input may be any two
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{length-}5$</span>
    strings.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a string consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> characters, representing the
    colors assigned to the letters in the guess, in the same order.
    Use ‘<tt class="ttfamily">G</tt>’ for green, ‘<tt class="ttfamily">Y</tt>’ for yellow, and ‘<tt class="ttfamily">-</tt>’ (hyphen) for gray.</p>
