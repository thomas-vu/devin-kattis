<p>In the card game “No Thanks,” the deck of cards consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$36$</span> cards numbered
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$36$</span>, and players collect cards to
    their score pile as the game is played. A player’s final score
    is the sum of the numbers on their collected cards, with one
    exception: if a player has collected any cards with two or more
    consecutive numbers, only the smallest number of that group
    counts toward the score. Your job is to compute the score for a
    single player’s pile of cards, though here we allow play with a
    deck much larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$36$</span>
    cards.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains one integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, representing the number of cards
    collected. The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers representing the numbers
    on the collected cards. You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 90\ 000$</span>, all card
    values are in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\ldots
    90\ 000$</span> inclusive, and no card value is repeated.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing the score for the given set
    of cards.</p>
