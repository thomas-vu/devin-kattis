<p>You are currently on a skiing trip with a group of friends.
    In general, it is going well: you enjoy the skiing during the
    day and, of course, the après-skiing during the night. However,
    there is one nuisance: the skiing lift. As always, it is too
    small, and can only serve one person every 5 seconds. To make
    matters worse, you and your friends generally don’t arrive
    simultaneously at the lift, which means that you spend time
    waiting at the bottom of the mountain for the lift and at the
    top again for your friends.</p>
<p>The waiting at the top is especially inefficient. In fact,
    you realize that if your friends haven’t arrived yet, you might
    as well let other people pass you in the queue. For you, it
    makes no difference, since otherwise you’d be waiting at the
    top. On the other hand, your actions might save them time if
    their friends have already arrived and are currently waiting
    for them at the top.</p>
<p>You are wondering how much time would be saved if everybody
    adopts this nice attitude. You have carefully observed the
    queue for a while and noticed which persons form groups of
    friends. Suppose someone lets another pass if doing this
    doesn’t change his own total waiting time, but saves time for
    the other person. Do this over and over again until it can’t be
    done anymore. How much time will this save, in total?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line a positive integer: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 25\, 000$</span>): the
        number of people in the line for the lift.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        alphanumeric characters (uppercase and lowercase letters
        and numbers): the queue. The first person in this line
        corresponds to the person at the head of the queue. Equal
        characters correspond to persons from the same group of
        friends.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with an integer: the time saved, in
        seconds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
