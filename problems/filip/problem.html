<div class="problembody">
<p>Mirko has a younger brother, Filip, who just started going
    to school and is having trouble with numbers. To help him get
    the hang of the number scale, his teacher writes two
    three-digit numbers. She asks Filip to compare those numbers,
    but instead of interpreting them with the leftmost most
    significant digit, he needs to interpret them the other way
    around, with the most significant digit being the rightmost
    one. He then has to tell the teacher the larger of the two
    numbers.</p>
<p>Write a program that will check Filipâ€™s answers.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains two three-digit
    numbers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> will not be equal and will not
    contain any zeroes.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output should contain the larger
    of the numbers in the input, compared as described in the task.
    The number should be written reversed, to display to Filip how
    he should read it.</p>
