<div class="problembody">
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> numbers
    hidden in the vault of the intergalactic hall of numbers.
    Visitors to the hall can see the least common multiple (LCM) of
    these numbers as part of the exhibit. Recall that the LCM of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1,x_2,\dots ,x_ n$</span> is the smallest
    positive integer which is divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1,x_2,\dots $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ n$</span>. As you are a member of the
    thieves guild, you would like to steal one of these numbers for
    yourself. However, you must be careful about which number you
    steal, because if the number you steal decreases the LCM too
    much, the guards may become suspicious.</p>
<p>Given the list of numbers in the vault, pick a number to
    steal that maximizes the LCM of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> remaining numbers.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3\le n\le 10^5$</span>) indicating how many
    numbers are in the vault. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain one of the
    numbers from the vault. The numbers will all be integers
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number that you should steal. If there are
    multiple optimal choices, output the smallest one.</p>
