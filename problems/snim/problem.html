<p>Arthur and his sister Carol have been playing a game called
    Nim for some time now. Nim is played as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The starting position has a number of heaps, all
        containing some, not necessarily equal, number of
        beads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The players take turns chosing a heap and removing a
        positive number of beads from it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first player not able to make a move, loses.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Arthur and Carol really enjoyed playing this simple game
    until they recently learned an easy way to always be able to
    find the best move:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Xor the number of beads in the heaps in the current
        position (i.e., if we have <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> the <em>xor-sum</em> will be
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> since <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\ \mathbf{xor}\ 4\ \mathbf{xor}\ 7 =
        1$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the xor-sum is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, too bad, you will lose.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, move such that the xor-sum becomes
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. This is always
        possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is quite easy to convince oneself that this works.
    Consider these facts:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The player that takes the last bead wins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the winning player’s last move the xor-sum will be
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The xor-sum will change after every move.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Which means that if you make sure that the xor-sum always is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> when you have made
    your move, your opponent will never be able to win, and, thus,
    you will win.</p>
<p>Understandably it is no fun to play a game when both players
    know how to play perfectly (ignorance is bliss). Fortunately,
    Arthur and Carol soon came up with a similar game, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>-Nim, that seemed to solve this
    problem. Each player is now only allowed to remove a number of
    beads in some predefined set <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, e.g. if we have <span class="tex2jax_process">$S = \{ 2, 5\} $</span> each player is only
    allowed to remove <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> or
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> beads. Now it is not
    always possible to make the xor-sum <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and, thus, the strategy above is
    useless. Or is it?</p>
<p>Your job is to write a program that determines if a position
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>-Nim is a losing or
    a winning position. A position is a winning position if there
    is at least one move to a losing position. A position is a
    losing position if there are no moves to a losing position.
    This means, as expected, that a position with no legal moves is
    a losing position.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le k \le 100$</span>) describing the size of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le s_ i \le 10\, 000$</span>) describing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>. The second line
    contains a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le 100$</span>)
    describing the number of positions to evaluate. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each contain a
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le l \le 100$</span>) describing the
    number of heaps and <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>
    numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le h_ i \le 10\,
    000$</span>) describing the number of beads in the heaps.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each position:</p>

        ‘<tt class="ttfamily">W</tt>’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the described position is a losing position print an
        ‘<tt class="ttfamily">L</tt>’.</p>
