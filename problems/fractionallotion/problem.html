<p>Freddy practices various kinds of alternative medicine, such
    as homeopathy. This practice is based on the belief that
    successively diluting some substances in water or alcohol while
    shaking them thoroughly produces remedies for many
    diseases.</p>
<p>This year, Freddy’s vegetables appear to have caught some
    disease and he decided to experiment a little bit and
    investigate whether homeopathy works for vegetables too. As
    Freddy is also a big fan of mathematics, he does not
    strictly insist that the substances have small concentrations,
    but he instead requires the concentrations to be reciprocals of
    integers (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1/n$</span>). In
    experiments, some of the vegetables really got much better.</p>
<p>Seeing Freddy’s successes, a fellow gardener also wants
    to try one of these potions and asks for a flask. Freddy
    has one flask of the potion in concentration <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/n$</span> and does not want to give it all
    out. Your task is to find out in how many ways the potion can
    be split into two flasks and diluted so that the resulting
    potions both have the same volume as the original one and the
    resulting concentrations also are reciprocals of integers — we
    do not want to end up with useless fluid, do we?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each line of the input describes one test case. The line
    contains the expression “<tt class="tt">1/<span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span></tt>” representing the original
    concentration. You are guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le n \le 10\, 000$</span>. There are no
    spaces on the line.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line with the total
    number of distinct pairs <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{
    x,y\} $</span> of positive integers satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/x + 1/y = 1/n$</span>. Pairs differing
    only in the order of the two numbers are not considered
    different.</p>
