<p>Mirko and Slavko are filming a movie adaptation of the
    popular SF novel “Chicks in space 13”. The script requires them
    to present a lot of different worlds so they decided to film
    the entire movie in front of a green screen and add CGI
    backgrounds later. Mirko heard that the best way to generate
    artificial terrain is to use midpoint displacement
    algorithm.</p>
<p>To start the algorithm, Mirko selects <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> points forming a perfect square.
    He then performs the following steps:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>On each side of the square, he adds a new point in the
        exact middle of the side. The height of this new point is
        the average height of the two points on that side.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the exact center of the square he adds a new point
        whose height is the average height of all <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> square vertices, plus a small
        random value.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After those two steps are performed, he now has <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> new squares. He performs the same
    steps on the newly created squares again and again until he is
    pleased with the results.</p>

<p>Mirko noticed that some of the points belong to more than
    one square. In order to decrease memory consumption, he
    calculates and stores such points only once. He now wonders how
    many points in total will he need to store in memory after
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> iterations.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains one integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 15$</span>), the number of
    iterations.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output should contain one number,
    the number of points stored after <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> iterations.</p>
