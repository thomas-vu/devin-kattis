<p>There is a legendary tale about Dragon Balls on Planet X: if
    one collects seven Dragon Balls, the Dragon God will show up
    and help you fulfill your wishes.</p>
<p>One day, you are surprised to discover that the tale might
    possibly be true: you found a Dragon Ball radar at a flea
    market! The radar shows you the locations of the seven Dragon
    Balls on Planet X. You want to waste no time checking the truth
    of the old legend about wish-granting for yourself!</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cities in
    total on the Planet X, numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. You are currently at city
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. To travel from one
    city to another, you can take any of <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> bidirectional teleport trips, as
    many times as you like. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th teleporter costs <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> coins to use each time, and it
    can teleport you between cities <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span>. To collect a Dragon Ball, you
    simply need to visit the city where itâ€™s located, as indicated
    on your radar. It is possible that multiple Dragon Balls are at
    the same city; in this case you pick all of them all up at once
    if you visit that city.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq n,m \leq 200\, 000)$</span>, the
    number of cities and possible teleport trips. Then follow
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines containing three
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
    i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> each <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le a_ i, b_ i \le n, 0 \le t_ i \le 10\,
    000)$</span>, which, as explained above, represent the two
    cities connected by the teleport trip, and cost to use the
    teleporter. Then follows one line of seven space-separated
    integers, representing the city IDs of the seven Dragon Balls
    showing on the radar. Each ID <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> satisfies the bound <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq c \leq n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the minimum number of coins that you need to spend to
    collect all seven Dragon Balls shown on the Dragon Ball radar.
    If there is no way to complete this task, print <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> instead.</p>
