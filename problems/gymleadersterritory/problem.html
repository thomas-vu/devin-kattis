<div class="problembody">
<p>You are a gym leader, and you’d like to conquer the
    territory of a certain rival gym leader. However, gym leaders
    sometimes make mutual alliances with each other to become
    stronger! When you challenge a gym leader, your Pokemon are
    only strong enough to defeat them if there is at most one other
    gym leader allied to them. You may attack as many gym leaders
    as you want (in any order), and whenever you defeat a gym
    leader, you take over their territory and terminate all
    alliances they may have had with other gym leaders.</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> other gym
    leaders (not including you), numbered from leader <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to leader <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Your rival is gym leader
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>. Given a list of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> mutual alliances
    between pairs of the other gym leaders, determine if it is
    possible to conquer the territory of your rival. Output “YES”
    if possible, and “NO” otherwise.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>: the number of other gym leaders,
    the rival gym leader, and the total number of alliances,
    respectively (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq
    10^5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq
    n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq m \leq
    10^{6}$</span>).</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines of
    input each contain two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_2$</span>, representing that there is an
    alliance between gym leader <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_1$</span> and gym leader <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m_1, m_2 \leq n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_1 \neq m_2$</span>). It is guaranteed that
    the input will not contain multiple alliances between the same
    pair of gym leaders.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing a single string: “YES” if it is
    possible to conquer gym leader <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, “NO” otherwise.</p>
