        Ponyo
      </div>
</div>
<p>Ponyo, after becoming human, needed to learn math. She
    quickly realized that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    is the most boring looking number.</p>
<p>So she created the glyph “&lt;]:=” which replaces
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, in remembrance of her
    friends the squids.</p>
<p>Thus, <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> is now
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>&lt;]:=, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$99 + 1 =
    1$</span>&lt;]:=&lt;]:=.</p>
<p>As an exercise, please help Ponyo perform all the math in
    the expressions given. Please evaluate this expression in the
    standard order of operations (multiplication and division
    should take precedence over addition and subtraction, and in
    case of ties in precedence, the operations should be evaluated
    left to right). Note that given Ponyo’s preferences, in the
    input expression, all <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>’s have been replaced with
    “&lt;]:=”. Thus, in your output, please replace all 0’s with
    “&lt;]:=” as well.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There are 2 lines of input. The first line of input is a
    single integer n (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq
    14$</span>), representing how many mathematical operations are
    in the expression.</p>
<p>The second line is a string representing a mathematical
    expression. This string consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n+1$</span> numbers, with each number being
    separated by one of four mathematical operations “*”, “/”, “+”,
    or “-”. Here "/" represents integer division (i.e. when
    integers are divided, the result is then truncated towards
    zero). It is guaranteed there will be spaces between numbers
    and mathematical operations.</p>
<p>Each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n+1$</span>
    numbers is guaranteed to be between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>. They consist of the characters
    “1” through “9”, with “0” being replaced by the symbol
    “&lt;]:=”.</p>
<p>All calculations are guaranteed to fit within a <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span>-bit integer. Calculations should
    follow the correct order of operations. There are no negative
    numbers in the input, but the output may be negative. It is
    also guaranteed that division by zero will not occur within the
    input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, the result of the expression. In
    this number <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, please
    replace all <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>’s with
    “&lt;]:=”.</p>
