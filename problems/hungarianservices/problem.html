<div class="problembody">
<p>You have been hired by Hungarian Services to match a list of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> problem proposals to a
    list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> problem topics
    for a contest, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$m \geq
    n$</span>. The problem proposals have an index of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \ldots , m$</span>, while the topics
    have an index of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \ldots
    n$</span>.</p>
<p>Not all problems are suitable for all topics. You will be
    given <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> tuples of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a_ i, b_ i, c_ i)$</span>
    denoting that problem proposal <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> can be matched to topic
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> with suitability of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span>. In a valid
    matching, each topic must be matched to exactly one suitable
    problem, while each problem can be matched to at most one
    topic.</p>
<p>Alas! it is not always possible to have a valid matching. A
    partial matching is a valid matching where some of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> topics may be
    unmatched. Your task is to find the minimum number of unmatched
    topics among all partial matchings. Among partial matchings
    that minimize the number of unmatched topics, maximize the sum
    of suitability of problem proposals to topics within the
    partial matching.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\leq n \leq m \leq 400; 1 \leq r \leq
    nm)$</span> — the number of topics, the number of problem
    proposals and the number of suitable pairs of problem proposals
    and topics.</p>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> of the
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines
    contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i, b_
    i, c_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq a_ i
    \leq n, 1 \leq b_ i \leq m, 1 \leq c_ i \leq 10)$</span>, where
    problem <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> can be
    matched to topic <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>
    with suitability <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span>.
    It is guaranteed that all <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a_ i,
    b_ i)$</span> pairs are unique.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two integers — the minimum number of unmatched
    topics, and the maximum sum of suitability of problem proposals
    to topics within the partial matching.</p>
