<p>Freddie the frosh has chosen to take <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> courses. To meet the degree
    requirements, he must take courses from each of several
    categories. Can you assure Freddie that he will graduate, based
    on his course selection?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of several test cases, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>. For each case, the first line of
    input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le k \le
    100$</span>, the number of courses Freddie has chosen, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le m \le 100$</span>, the
    number of categories. A line follow containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-digit integers; each is the number
    of a course selected by Freddie. Each category is represented
    by a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le c \le
    100$</span>, the number of courses in the category,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le r \le c$</span>, the
    minimum number of courses from the category that must be taken,
    and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> course numbers
    in the category. Each course number is a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-digit integer. The same course may
    fulfil several category requirements. Freddie’s selections, and
    the course numbers in any particular category, are distinct. A
    line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    follows the last test case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing “<tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt>” if Freddie’s course selection meets the
    degree requirements; otherwise output “<tt class="ttfamily">no</tt>”.</p>
