<p>Coconut Splat is one of Theta’s favorite counting-out games.
    It goes like this: initially, all players stand in a circle
    with their hands folded together (like an intact coconut). In
    clockwise order, one player touches the hands of the other
    players and says the rhyme: “Co-co-nut, Co-co-nut, Co-co-nut,
    Splat!” At each syllable, the player touches a hand, and the
    player whose hand or hands is touched last takes one of the
    following actions:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If the player’s hands are still folded, they are split
        into two fists (the coconut is cracked in two halves). The
        next round starts with the fist that is the first half of
        the coconut, then the second half, then going to the next
        player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a fist is touched last, the hand is turned palm down
        (the milk spills out). The next round starts with the next
        hand in clockwise order, which could be the other hand of
        the same player, or it could be the hand or folded hands
        belonging to the next player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a hand that is already turned palm down is touched
        last, the player to whom it belongs puts the hand behind
        their back and this hand won’t be counted in the following
        rounds. The next round starts with the next hand in
        clockwise order as in the previous case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a player has put both of their hands behind their
        back, that player is out of the game. The game ends when
        there is only one player left.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The hand or hands of the player doing the counting are taken
    into account (for instance, the counting player touches their
    thigh when it would be her turn to be touched).</p>
<p>There are variations of this game, for instance, some kids
    say “Coconut, coconut, crack your nut!” instead, which has only
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> instead of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> syllables as in the
    “Co-co-nut, Co-co-nut, Co-co-nut, Splat!” rhyme.</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> players,
    and counting always starts with the folded hands of player
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. For instance, in the
    first round, if the rhyme has <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> syllables, player <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> would be the one to first crack
    their coconut into two fists.</p>
<p>Write a program that determines the winner of the
    counting-out game based on the number of players and based on
    the number of syllables in the rhyme that is used!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case with two numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; s \le 100$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le n \le 100$</span>) denoting the number of syllables in the
    rhyme and the number of players, respectively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le p \le n$</span>), the number of the player who is left.</p>
