<p>An object is sometimes called ‘self-similar’ if there are
    parts of it that are repeated in other places within the same
    object. Fractals are self-similar mathematical objects, where
    the similarities occur at different sizes.</p>
<p>Here, we’ll consider ‘self-similar strings.’ We’ll say that
    a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is
    self-similar to degree <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>
    if all <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>-length
    substrings of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> occur in
    at least one other location in <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>. For example, the string ‘babbabb’
    is self-similar to degree 0, degree 1, and degree 2. It is not
    self-similar to any greater degree. It should be clear that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d \leq |s|-1$</span>.</p>
<p>Write a program which determines the largest degree of
    self-similarity for given strings.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input is a list of up to 10000 strings, one per line. Each
    string is made of up to 80 lower-case alphabet characters
    (a-z). Input ends at the end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each string, print the largest degree to which the
    string is self-similar.</p>
