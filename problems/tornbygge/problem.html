        Towers corresponding to Sample <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Kimâ€™s current obsession is to build towers from ordered
    sequences of Lego bricks. The towers are built one at a time,
    brick by brick. The first available brick is the base of the
    first tower. If the next available brick is wider than the top
    of the current tower, we say that the current tower is finished
    and make the brick the base of a new tower. Otherwise, the
    brick is placed (in an arbitrary fashion) on top of the current
    tower.</p>
<p>Given the ordering and widths of the bricks, how many towers
    is Kim going to build?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>An integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10^5$</span>,
    followed by a line consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x_ i \leq 10^6$</span>, corresponding
    to the width of the bricks in the order they are available.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single integer, the number of resulting towers.</p>
