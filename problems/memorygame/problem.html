<div class="problembody">
<p>You’re playing memory with David. <span class="tex2jax_process">$2N$</span> cards are placed face down in a
    row, each number between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> shown on two cards. The players
    take turns choosing two cards, if a player chooses two cards
    with the same number they earn a point, the cards are removed
    and the player can make another move. If the player picks two
    different cards, the cards are replaced and the opponent makes
    a move. The player with the most points wins.</p>
<p>Before starting, David goes to fetch his lucky necklace. You
    decide to take a peek at <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> cards while he’s away. If he lets
    you start, how many pairs can you find with certainty?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 10^5$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq K \leq 2N$</span>), the highest number on any card and the
    amount of cards you’ve looked at. We can assume you don’t look
    at the same card more than once, and that there are always an
    even amount of cards.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> space separated integers, the
    numbers on the cards you have seen.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The number of pairs you can find with certainty.</p>
