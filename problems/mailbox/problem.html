<div class="problembody">
<p>In the good old days when Swedish children were still
    allowed to blow up their fingers with fire-crackers, gangs of
    excited kids would plague certain smaller cities during Easter
    time, with only one thing in mind: To blow things up. Small
    boxes were easy to blow up, and thus mailboxes became a popular
    target. Now, a small mailbox manufacturer is interested in how
    many fire-crackers his new mailbox prototype can withstand
    without exploding and has hired you to help him. He will
    provide you with <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le k \le 10$</span>)
    identical mailbox prototypes each fitting up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le m \le 100$</span>) crackers.</p>
<p>However, he is not sure of how many fire-crackers he needs
    to provide you with in order for you to be able to solve his
    problem, so he asks you. You think for a while and then
    say:</p>
<p>“Well, if I blow up a mailbox I can’t use it again, so if
    you would provide me with only <span class="tex2jax_process">$k
    = 1$</span> mailboxes, I would have to start testing with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> cracker, then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> crackers, and so on
    until it finally exploded. In the worst case, that is if it
    does not blow up even when filled with <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> crackers, I would need
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + m = \frac{m
    (m + 1)}{2}$</span> crackers. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$m = 100$</span> that would mean more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5000$</span> fire-crackers!”</p>
<p>“That’s too many”, he replies. “What if I give you more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k = 1$</span> mailboxes? Can you
    find a strategy that requires fewer fire crackers?”</p>
<p>Can you? And what is the minimum number of crackers that you
    should ask him to provide you with?</p>
<p>You may assume the following:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>If a mailbox can withstand <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> fire-crackers, it can also
        withstand <span class="tex2jax_process">$x-1$</span>
        fire-crackers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon an explosion, a mailbox is either totally destroyed
        (blown up) or unharmed, which means that it can be reused
        in another test explosion.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note:</em> If the mailbox can withstand a full load of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> fire-crackers, then
    the manufacturer will of course be satisfied with that answer.
    But otherwise he is looking for the maximum number of crackers
    that his mailboxes can withstand.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 100$</span>) indicating the number of test cases to
    follow. Each test case is described by a line containing two
    integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, separated by a single
    space.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case print one line with a single integer
    indicating the minimum number of fire-crackers that is needed,
    in the worst case, in order to figure out how many crackers the
    mailbox prototype can withstand.</p>
