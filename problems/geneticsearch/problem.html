<p>Technology has greatly changed the field of biology in the
    last decade, since biological information can be digitized and
    analyzed by computer. One of the most basic analysis tasks is
    counting the number of occurrences (or near-occurrences) of a
    search string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> inside
    of another string <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> that
    is at least as long as <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>.</p>
<p>For this problem, you are given pairs of strings
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>. Both strings contain only the
    uppercase characters A, G, C, and T. For each of the following
    types of search strings, count the number of times that type
    occurs as an exact substring of <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Type 1: <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>,
        without any changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type 2: All unique strings that can be made by deleting
        one character from <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>
        (for example, AGC can become AG, AC, or GC).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Type 3: All unique strings that can be made by inserting
        one character in <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>
        (for example, AG can become any of the following: AAG, GAG,
        CAG, TAG, AGG, ACG, ATG, AGA, AGC, or AGT).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If two or more different modifications of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> result in the same string, count
    only the occurrences of that string once.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$250$</span> test cases, each of which is a
    line containing strings <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>, separated by a single space. The
    constraints are <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le |S| \le
    |L| \le 100$</span>. Each string consists only of the
    characters A, G, C, and T. The last test case is followed by a
    line containing a single zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the number of occurrences of Type
    1, then Type 2, then Type 3.</p>
