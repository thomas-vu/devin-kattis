<div class="problembody">
<p>You are the boss of <span class="scshape">ACM</span>
    (Association for Cool Machineries), an upstanding company with
    a single goal of world domination.</p>
<p>Like all other world domination oriented villains, you dream
    of having a gigantic evil robot doing evil deeds. I mean, is
    there anyone who can resist the urge of having your own
    personal gigantic laser-firing robot? Thus, it is to your
    ultimate joy when the scientific committee of <span class="scshape">ACM</span> told you about their success in inventing
    a prototype for the GL-bot (shorthand for Giant Laser
    Robot).</p>
<p>As a demonstration, they have placed GL-bot on a field
    modeled as an <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \times N$</span>
    grid. Each cell in the grid is either empty or impassable. All
    cells on the borders of the grid are impassable. GL-bot is
    initially located on one of these empty cells.</p>
<p>The GL-bot’s behavior is programmed with a string of length
    at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. Each
    character in the string is either <tt class="ttfamily">&lt;</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">&gt;</tt>,
    <tt class="ttfamily">^</tt>, or <tt class="ttfamily">v</tt>,
    denoting four directions of movement. GL-bot will continuously
    move on the grid according to this string. The movement works
    as follows. GL-bot considers the characters in the string one
    by one, starting from the first character until the last
    character, and then loop back to the first character and
    repeat. GL-bot performs a movement depending on the character
    being considered (for the images below, black cells denote
    impassable cells, while white cells denote empty cells):</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">&lt;</tt>: GL-bot moves to the left
        one step, if able.</p>
<p><img alt="\includegraphics{left.jpg}" src="/problems/cool1/file/statement/en/img-0001.jpg" style="width:; height:"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">&gt;</tt>: GL-bot moves to the
        right one step, if able.</p>
<p><img alt="\includegraphics{right.jpg}" src="/problems/cool1/file/statement/en/img-0002.jpg" style="width:; height:"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">v</tt>: GL-bot moves down one step,
        if able.</p>
<p><img alt="\includegraphics{down.jpg}" src="/problems/cool1/file/statement/en/img-0003.jpg" style="width:; height:"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">^</tt>: GL-bot moves up one step,
        if able.</p>
<p><img alt="\includegraphics{up.jpg}" src="/problems/cool1/file/statement/en/img-0004.jpg" style="width:; height:"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>More specifically, GL-bot moves one cell from its current
    location to the location as determined by the character.
    However, if the new location is impassable, the robot does not
    perform the move, and this movement is skipped. GL-bot then
    considers the next character in the program.</p>
<p>The trail of GL-bot is the (possibly infinite) sequence of
    (possibly non-distinct) cells of the grid that GL-bot traverses
    in order. The trail can be viewed to be generated as follows:
    initially, before GL-bot performs any movement, the trail
    contains one element: the initial location of GL-bot. Whenever
    GL-bot moves into a different cell, the new location of GL-bot
    is added to the trail. In particular, this implies that no two
    consecutive cells in the trail are the same — if the robot is
    unable to move in a particular direction because it was
    occupied by an impassable cell, the trail is not extended.</p>
<p>You giggle giddily as you watch GL-bot move. For some
    program and for some grid configuration, GL-bot will never stop
    moving, no matter how long time has passed. It can be proven
    that in this case, the trail will eventually end up repeating a
    continuous subsequence of itself. But you…, you don’t see such
    a thing. What you see is a robot that moves perpetually, as if
    it is sapient. Your fascination with GL-bot leaves the
    scientific committee worried, as GL-bot is not actually sapient
    yet (it just needs a few more tweaks). Thus, they attempt to
    convince you by showing that the movement is simply follows a
    pattern. If the length of the trail of the robot is finite, you
    should output <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.
    Otherwise, let <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> be the
    smallest integer such that the suffix of the trail will be a
    repetition of a continuous subsequence of the trail of length
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>. Find
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a non-negative integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq N \leq 200$</span>, denoting both the
    dimension of the field and the maximum possible length of
    GL-bot’s program.</p>
<p>The next line contains a non-empty string of length at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, consisting only of
    the characters <tt class="ttfamily">&lt;</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">&gt;</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">^</tt>, and
    <tt class="ttfamily">v</tt>. This string denotes GL-bot’s
    program.</p>
<p>Thereafter follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines, each consists of a string consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> characters. Each line describes a
    row of the grid — the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th character of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line denotes the content of the
    cell located at the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    row from the top and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th column from the left, and is
    either one of these:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">#</tt>: denotes an impassable
        cell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>: denotes an empty cell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>: denotes an empty cell on
        which the robot initially resides.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is guaranteed that the grid will contain exactly one
    character R, and that the first and final rows and columns
    consist entirely of the character <tt class="ttfamily">#</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the robot’s trail is of finite length, print a single
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Otherwise,
    print a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>
    as described in the problem statement.</p>
<h3>Sample Data Explanation</h3>
<p>In the first example, the trail of the robot is illustrated
    as follows:</p>
<p><img alt="\includegraphics[scale=0.25]{example1.jpg}" src="/problems/cool1/file/statement/en/img-0005.jpg" style="width:; height:"/></p>
<p>Hence, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X=2$</span> in this
    case.</p>
