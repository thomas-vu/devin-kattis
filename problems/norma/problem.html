<div class="problembody">
<p>Mirko got an array of integers for his birthday from his
    grandmother Norma. As any other kid, he was hoping for some
    money, but got an array. Luckily, in his town there is a pawn
    shop that buys up arrays. The cost of an array of integers is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\min \cdot \max \cdot L$</span>
    kunas, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$\min $</span> is
    the minimal integer in the array, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\max $</span> is the maximal and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> is the array length.
    Mirko is going to sell a subsequence of consecutive numbers
    from his array. He calculated the average price of all such
    subsequences.</p>
<p>In order to check his result, he wants you to do the same.
    He will be pleased with only the last <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> digits of the sum of all prices,
    so you don’t need to bother with large and real numbers.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 500\, 000$</span>).</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains a member of Mirko’s
    array. The members of the array will be integers from the
    interval <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1, 10^8 ]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain an integer,
    the last <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> digits of the
    required sum from the task. You <em>don’t need to output</em>
    the leading zeroes of that 9-digit integer.</p>
