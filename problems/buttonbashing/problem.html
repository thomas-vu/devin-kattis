<p>You recently acquired a new microwave, and noticed that it
    provides a large number of buttons to be able to quickly
    specify the time that the microwave should be running for.
    There are buttons both for adding time, and for subtracting
    time. You wonder how efficient you can be when entering cooking
    times: you want to minimize the number of required button
    presses.</p>
<p>The microwave can be running for at least 0 seconds, and at
    most 1 hour. If a button press would result in a cooking time
    of less than 0 seconds, the microwave will set the cooking time
    to 0 seconds. If a button press would result in a cooking time
    of more than 1 hour, the microwave will set the cooking time to
    1 hour. Initially, the microwave will run for 0 seconds. There
    will always be a button adding at least 1 second to the cooking
    time.</p>
<p>Given the buttons that the microwave provides for entering
    cooking times, determine the least amount of button presses
    required to let the microwave run for a certain amount of time.
    If it is not possible to enter the desired cooking time
    precisely, determine the smallest achievable cooking time above
    the target, and the minimum number of button presses required
    for that cooking time, instead. The microwave does not allow to
    adjust the cooking time once it has started cooking.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 16$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq t \leq 3\,
        600$</span>): the number of buttons available to change the
        cooking time, and the desired cooking time in seconds,
        respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_
        i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-3\, 600 \leq b_
        i \leq 3\, 600$</span>): the number of seconds added to the
        cooking time when button <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is pressed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with two space-separated integers: the minimum
        number of button presses required to reach the required
        cooking time, and the minimum number of extra seconds that
        the microwave must be running for, respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
