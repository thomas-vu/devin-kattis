<p>Ingfríður has grown curious about her internal content
    description. She heard that various properties of an individual
    can be deduced from these data, so she has to try it. After
    getting the data sent over from the company Encode she has
    everything she needs. To analyse the data she needs to find
    sections that match known patterns, but if analysing some
    sections is good, analysing all sections must be better. Thus
    Ingfríður wants to analyse all sections. We define a section to
    be all characters in the data from some specific starting
    character to some ending character.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single line giving the internal content
    description of Ingfríður. The description consists of the
    letters <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">C</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">G</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">T</tt> and has no spaces. The description is at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> letters in
    length.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each section in the description print one line, the
    number of occurrences it has in the description and then the
    section itself, separated by spaces. A section should not be
    printed multiple times in the output even if it occurs multiple
    times. The lines should be printed in descending order by the
    number of occurrences. If two sections are tied for number of
    occurrences, resolve the tie by putting the section that comes
    first alphabetically before the other.</p>
