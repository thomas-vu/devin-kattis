<p>The fundamental theorem of arithmetic says that every
    integer can be represented as a unique product of prime
    numbers. For example, consider the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$319\, 176$</span>. It can be written as the
    product <span class="tex2jax_process">$31 \times 3 \times 3
    \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 13 \times 11$</span>, or more
    succinctly as <span class="tex2jax_process">$31 \times 3^2
    \times 2^3 \times 13 \times 11$</span> if we collect the common
    factors. And, of course we could rearrange these product terms
    in any order.</p>
<p>Write a program that reads integers as input, and for each
    integer print out the representation of that integer as a
    product of primes and their exponents.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input is a list of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span> integers, one per line,
    ending at end of file. Each integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> has the property that <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq |x| \leq 2^{31}-1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, print a line with a prime
    factorization of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>.
    Combine common factors using exponential notation, and order
    the factors by the value of the base (from least to greatest).
    Separate factors using spaces, but don’t use spaces between a
    base and its exponent. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is negative, prepend “<tt class="tt">-1</tt> ” to the factorization of <span class="tex2jax_process">$|x|$</span>.</p>
