<div class="problembody">
<p>War is a classic and very simple two-player card game played
    with a standard <span class="tex2jax_process">$52$</span>-card
    deck. The deck is shuffled and split into two equal-sized
    piles, one for each player, with cards face down. To play, both
    players turn over the top card of their draw pile. The player
    whose card rank is higher (suit doesn’t matter) wins both
    cards. In our variant of War for this problem, when a tie in
    rank occurs, both players take their one card back.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> The ranks of the cards, from highest
    to lowest, are [A]ce, [K]ing, [Q]ueen, [J]ack, [T]en,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>. After the card battle is settled,
    both players would turn over the next card in their draw piles
    for the following battle, and so forth. Also in our variant,
    after the initial <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span>-card piles have been exhausted,
    both players count the cards they have won, and the player with
    the most cards wins the game.</p>
<p>Yraglac found himself playing War with a friend, and the
    first ten card battles of a game went like this:</p>

<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth ]{figure-war.pdf}" src="/problems/cheatingatwar/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:90.00%"/>
</center>
<p>At this point in the game, Yraglac would have won a total of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> cards.<br/></p>
<p>After a few games, Yraglac was bored out of his mind because
    the game, clearly, has <i class="itshape">absolutely no element
    of strategy whatsoever!</i> At the beginning of the next game,
    when his friend wasn’t looking, he decided to take a peek
    through both piles of cards and wondered, “How many cards could
    I win if I could rearrange my own pile of cards?” Now there’s a
    challenge worthy of his mighty brain!</p>
<p>It turned out for Yraglac that cheating at War was a little
    harder than he initially thought. Can you help by writing a
    program that, given lists of the cards in Yraglac’s opponent’s
    pile and in his own pile, determines the most cards Yraglac can
    win if he could rearrange the cards in his draw pile in any
    order he likes?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 50$</span>,
    indicating the number of games of war to be played. Following,
    there are two lines of input for each game. The first of the
    two lines contains a <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span>-character string indicating the
    cards in the opponent’s pile, in the order that they will be
    played. Non-numeric cards are encoded with a single capital
    letter as described in the problem statement. The second of the
    two lines indicates the <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span> cards in Yraglac’s pile. Both
    piles together will always form the set of cards in a standard
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$52$</span>-card deck.<br/></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each game of War described in the input, output on a
    single line the highest number of cards Yraglac can win if he
    were able to rearrange his pile of cards to be played in any
    order.</p>
