<p><em>Note that this is a harder version of the problem
    averageseasy.</em></p>
<p>One well-known joke goes as follows: If a bad Computer
    Science student drops out of college and goes to a different
    college to study Economics instead, he will increase the
    average intelligence on both colleges.</p>
<p>In this problem we investigate the math behind this joke.
    Given the list of student IQs for both colleges, find the
    number of students of Computer Science that can make the joke
    true.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input file contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> specifying the number
    of test cases. Each test case is preceded by a blank line.</p>
<p>Each test case looks as follows: The first line contains two
    positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_{CS}$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_ E$</span> – the number of
    students of Computer Science and Economics, respectively. The
    number of Computer Science students will be at least 2 and
    there will be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$200\,
    000$</span> students in every college.</p>
<p>The following lines contain a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_{CS}+N_ E$</span> whitespace-separated
    positive integers giving the IQs of all the students. The first
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_{CS}$</span> students
    mentioned in the input are Computer Science students, the
    remaining ones study Economics. The IQ of some students can be
    as high as <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case output a single line with a single
    integer – the number of Computer Science students that would
    cause the funny event to happen.</p>
