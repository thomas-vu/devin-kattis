<div class="problembody">
<p>You are the head of a group of survivors in the zombie
    apocalypse.</p>
<p>Just recently you’ve heard word of an incoming zombie horde
    heading to your facility. As commander in chief the
    responsibility falls on to you to prepare for the incoming
    invasion.</p>
<p>Luckily these zombies are very slow, allowing you and your
    team to easily pick them off one by one. Every zombie has a
    finite amount of health, <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span>, and every survivor has their own
    health, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>, as well.</p>
<p>You and your team have devised the following strategy for
    dealing with the horde. The healthiest survivor will attack the
    closest zombie. In order to reduce the angle of attack, you and
    your team have created a funnel that allows the zombies to
    approach in single file.</p>
<p>There may be better strategies, but this was the one you and
    your team have chosen and failure to comply will result in a
    mutiny.</p>
<h2>Strategy</h2>
<p>Over the course of the stand-off two possible events can
    happen:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>A zombie approaches the shelter, and stands in line
        outside of the funnel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next zombie is attacked by the healthiest
        survivor.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>During the battle between a zombie and a survivor, the
    survivor’s health is reduced by the health of the attacking
    zombie and vice versa. If the zombie is too strong then the
    survivor’s health is completely reduced and the zombie’s health
    is reduced by the survivor’s lost health. An additional
    survivor will be required to save them, in which case the same
    process will repeat until either no survivors remain or the
    zombie is eliminated (it is possible for a single sufficiently
    powerful zombie to destroy your whole team). If the survivor
    and zombie have the same amount of health then the zombie will
    be killed and the survivor’s health will be reduced to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, sending them to the
    medical ward.</p>
<p>Once a survivor has had their health completely reduced they
    are put into the medical ward where they await treatment.
    Otherwise if they survive a zombie attack event they’ll take a
    break to recuperate, making them unavailable for the next event
    afterwards.</p>
<p>If a survivor returns to base and they have the same health
    as another survivor, then the survivor with the highest
    maximum, or original health, goes first.</p>
<p>As the team’s only doctor, you do not participate in the
    battle. Instead, starting at the beginning of the battle, at
    the beginning of every <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>th event, a new batch of medicine
    is prepared. This medicine can be used to heal one person in
    the medical ward, and as the doctor you choose to always heal
    the person with the most starting health. This medicine however
    expires quickly and must be used as soon as it is prepared. The
    healed person returns to the pool of available fighters and is
    available for whatever event occurs next, but their health is
    reduced to half the amount it was at the beginning of the
    invasion rounded down (if they started with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> health, the medicine is
    ineffective and they stay in the medical ward).</p>
<p>Using the strategy outlined above, can your team survive the
    zombie onslaught or do you eventually get overrun?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with two space-separated integers indicating
    the number of survivors <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le
    S\le 25$</span>, and the rate at which you can produce medicine
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le 50$</span>.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> space-separated integers
    indicating the health <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le h_ i
    \le 255$</span> for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th survivor. The third line
    contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le
    e \le 50$</span> indicating the number of events. Now the
    battle begins and <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span>
    lines follow. Each of the subsequent lines indicate an event.
    They are either of the form <tt>APPROACH</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span>, indicating a new zombie with
    health <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le z \le 255$</span>
    approaches battle, or just the string <tt>ATTACK</tt>,
    indicating that it’s time to attack the next zombie.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that there will be an <tt>ATTACK</tt>
    command only if there are zombies to attack, and that the
    number of <tt>ATTACK</tt> commands equals the number of
    <tt>APPROACH</tt> commands.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output is a single line containing either the string
    <tt>success</tt>, if your team is able to withstand the
    zombies, or <tt>overrun</tt> if there are no survivors
    available to attack the next zombie. Note that even if all
    survivors are in the medical ward at the end, you have still
    withstood the zombies because the doctor is still alive.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample 1</h2>
<p>A single survivor is waiting with <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> health, not counting the doctor
    (you). Suddenly zombies are seen approaching the battlefield,
    the first with <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> health
    and the second with <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span>.
    The first zombie gets too close and is attacked by the
    survivor, killing the zombie. While the survivor is
    recuperating, the second zombie enters the base. With no one
    available to fight it, the zombie gets past the defenses and
    eats your brain.</p>
<p>You are <tt>overrun</tt>.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample 4</h2>
<p>You have three survivors with healths <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$27$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$23$</span>. Eight events occur, with
    medicine available on every eighth event (and therefore on the
    last event).</p>
<p>In the first event, a supercharged zombie with <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> health approaches the funnel,
    and comes too close to the base in the second event, requiring
    an attack. You send out the strongest survivor who also has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> health against the
    zombie. The evenly-matched foes fight until they both have no
    health left, killing the zombie and sending the survivor
    crawling back to the medical ward.</p>
<p>In the third event, a second zombie with <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> health approaches, requiring a
    second attack in the fourth event. The current healthiest
    survivor has <span class="tex2jax_process">$27$</span> health,
    and they manage to defeat the zombie, taking <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> points of damage resulting in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> health left.</p>
<p>A third zombie with <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span> health approaches in the fifth
    event, and in the sixth event the third survivor, with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$23$</span> health, begins their
    first fight, killing the zombie and emerging with <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> health remaining.</p>
<p>In the seventh event, the final menacing zombie with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$75$</span> health approaches,
    and attacks in the eighth and final event. Fortunately, you’ve
    managed to prepare a batch of medicine in the nick of time, and
    give it to the first survivor who recovers to <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> health. The first survivor, once
    again the healthiest, gives their all in the fight, doing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> damage to the zombie.
    This doesn’t settle things yet, so they have to return right
    back to the medical ward, leaving the zombie with <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> health.</p>
<p>The second survivor, now with <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> health, does their part in the
    battle, reducing the zombie to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> health, but ultimately has to
    join the first survivor in the ward. The third survivor (also
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> health), who
    spent the seventh event recuperating from battle, takes up the
    mantle of the first two and engages in one last desperate stand
    against the final zombie. When the dust clears, the zombie is
    defeated and all the survivors rest in the medicine ward.</p>
<p>With no more zombies in sight, you tend to the exhausted
    survivors and write down a single word summing up the
    terrifying day as you stare into the
    sunset—<tt>success</tt>!</p>
