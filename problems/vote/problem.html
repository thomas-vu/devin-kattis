</div>In an election with more than two candidates, it is often
    the case that the winner (the candidate receiving the most
    votes) receives less than the majority of the votes. Given the
    results of an election, can you determine the winner, and
    whether the winner received more than half of the votes?

    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 500$</span> indicating
    the number of test cases. The first line of each test case also
    contains a single positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> indicating the number of
    candidates in the election. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, with the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th line containing a single
    nonnegative integer indicating the number of votes candidate
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> received.</p>
<p>There are at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    and no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    candidates in each case, and each candidate will not receive
    more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$50\, 000$</span>
    votes. There will be at least one vote cast in each
    election.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Provide a line of output for each test case. If the winner
    receives more than half of the votes, print the phrase
    <tt>majority winner</tt> followed by the candidate number of
    the winner. If the winner does not receive more than half of
    the votes, print the phrase <tt>minority winner</tt> followed
    by the candidate number of the winner. If a winner cannot be
    determined because no single candidate has more vote than
    others, print the phrase <tt>no winner</tt>. The candidate
    numbers in each case are <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2,
    \ldots , n$</span>.</p>
