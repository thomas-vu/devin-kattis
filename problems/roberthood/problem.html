<p>Robert Hood, a less famous sibling of the Robin Hood, is fed
    up. Despite him being a young, talented archer he never seems
    to reach quite the same level as his legendary brother, and so
    he decided to come up with rules for a new archery contest, in
    which he will stand a better chance of winning.</p>
<p>The rules for the new kind of archery contest are quite
    simple: the winner is no longer the one who can score the most
    points, but instead the one who can achieve the longest
    distance between any pair of arrows hitting the target. Your
    task is to write the code to calculate that distance.</p>
<p>Each contestant is allowed a number of arrow shots, and the
    coordinates of the arrows successfully hitting the target are
    given as a list of pairs. The coordinate system is Cartesian
    with the origin in the centre of the archery butt. If a
    contestant does not hit the target with at least two arrows he
    or she is disqualified and removed from the input data.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line containing a single positive
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$C, 2 \le C \le 100\,
    000$</span>, representing the number of shots for this
    particular contestant. Each following line contains a pair of
    integer coordinates separated by a space, representing the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>- and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-coordinates of a successful shot.
    The absolute value of any coordinate does not exceed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the longest distance between any pair of arrows as a
    floating point number on a single line. The answer is
    considered correct if it has a relative or absolute error of
    less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
