<div class="problembody">
<p>A brand new Ultra-CISC microprocessor has a collection of
    instructions for manipulating individual bits of one of its
    32-bit registers. The instructions work as described in the
    following table. In all cases, bit zero is the low-order bit
    and bit 31 is the high-order bit. The representation of the
    instruction set makes it impossible to try to manipulate bits
    outside this range.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>CLEAR <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span><br/>
        Put a zero into bit <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>SET <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span><br/>
        Put a one into bit <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>OR <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span><br/>
        Store in bit <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> the
        logical OR of the contents of bits <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>AND <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span><br/>
        Store in bit <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> the
        logical AND of the contents of bits <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your job is to determine the contents of the register after
    a sequence of these operations. Unfortunately, you don’t know
    anything about what was in the register before the
    instructions.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of multiple instruction sequences, each
    beginning with a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \leq 100$</span>. This is followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each giving a
    legal bit manipulation instruction. All bits referenced are in
    the range 0 – 31 (inclusive). The end of input is marked with a
    value of 0 for <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>Each instruction sequence in the input is to be interpreted
    independently. You should assume nothing about the contents of
    the register before each instruction sequence.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each instruction sequence, print out a line giving the
    final contents of the register. Print your result in binary,
    with the most significant bit on the left. Since you don’t know
    anything about what was in the register before the sequence,
    you may not be able to determine the values of some bits. Just
    print a question mark for these bits.</p>
