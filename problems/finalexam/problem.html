<p>In the final round of the Hunter Exam, candidates must prove
    their ability to process big data as well as geometry
    knowledge.</p>
<p>In the Examination Hall, the candidates can find three piles
    of segments:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first pile has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_
        a$</span> segments, and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th segment has length
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second pile has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_
        b$</span> segments, and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th segment has length
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ j$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third pile has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_
        c$</span> segments, and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>-th segment has length
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ k$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The candidates must quickly select three segments, one
    segment from each pile, such that:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The three segments can be used to form a <b class="bfseries">right triangle</b>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The segment chosen from the third pile must be
        longest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As the organizer of the Hunter Exam, you need to make sure
    that the difficulty is right for the final round. Thus you want
    to know the number of ways to select three segments, satisfying
    the conditions above?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains exactly three integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ c$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le n_ a, n_ b, n_ c \le 3 \cdot
    10^5)$</span>.</p>
<p>The second line of the input contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ a$</span> integers — the lengths of
    the segments in the first pile.</p>
<p>The third line of the input contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ b$</span> integers — the lengths of
    the segments in the second pile.</p>
<p>The fourth line of the input contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ c$</span> integers — the lengths of
    the segments in the third pile.</p>
<p>All the lengths of the segments are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \cdot 10^7$</span>, inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print exactly one integer — the number of triplets.</p>
<h2>Explanation of sample test</h2>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> different
    ways to select three segments: <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3, 4, 5)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3, 4, 5)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(4, 3, 5)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(4, 3, 5)$</span>.</p>
<p>Selecting <span class="tex2jax_process">$(5, 4, 3)$</span>
    is not valid, as the segment from the third pile must be the
    longest segment.</p>
