<p>Daylight Saving Time (DST) is the practice of advancing
    clocks forward during the summer time, usually by one hour, to
    gain an extra hour of sunlight in the evenings, at the cost of
    darker mornings. Countries and regions have changed their DST
    practices over the years, sometimes changing the dates they
    switch the clocks, and other times changing the amount of
    minutes the clock changes by.</p>
<p>This creates a real hassle. Sleep cycles are disrupted,
    operating systems and other computer software needs to follow
    special rules, and sometimes people end up late to work because
    of it.</p>
<p>To help make this easier on people, youâ€™ve decided to make a
    computer program which calculates the new time after an
    adjustment.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 500$</span>) indicating the number of test cases that
    follow. Each test case consists of a single line with the
    following information:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>a single character to indicate whether the clock will
        roll forwards (<tt class="ttfamily">F</tt>) or backwards
        (<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le D \le 120$</span>)
        indicating the number of minutes to change by,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le H &lt; 24$</span>)
        indicating the hour the clock currently reads (without
        leading zeros), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le M &lt; 60$</span>)
        indicating the minutes the clock currently reads.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, give the time (hours in <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>-hour format, followed by a space,
    followed by minutes) after the adjustment has occurred, one
    test case per line. You may report the numbers without leading
    zeros.</p>
