<p>The Army of Coin-tossing Monkeys (ACM) is in the business of
    producing randomness. Good random numbers are important for
    many applications, such as cryptography, online gambling,
    randomized algorithms and panic attempts at solutions in the
    last few seconds of programming competitions.</p>
<p>Recently, one of the best monkeys has had to retire.
    However, before he left, he invented a new, cheaper way to
    generate randomness compared to directly using the randomness
    generated by coin-tossing monkeys. The method starts by taking
    an undirected graph with <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^
    n$</span> nodes labelled <span class="tex2jax_process">$0, 1,
    \ldots , 2^ n-1$</span>. To generate <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> random <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-bit numbers, they will let the
    monkeys toss <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> coins to
    decide where on the graph to start. This node number is the
    first number output. The monkeys will then pick a random edge
    from this node, and jump to the node that this edge connects
    to. This new node will be the second random number output. They
    will then select a random edge from this node (possibly back to
    the node they arrived from in the last step), follow it and
    output the number of the node they landed on. This walk will
    continue until <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> numbers
    have been output.</p>
<p>During experiments, the ACM has noticed that different
    graphs give different output distributions, some of them not
    very random. So, they have asked for your help testing the
    graphs to see if the randomness is of good enough quality to
    sell.</p>
<p>They consider a graph good if, for each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> bits in each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> numbers generated, the probability
    that this bit is output as <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$25\% $</span> and smaller than <span class="tex2jax_process">$75\% $</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will consist of several data sets, at most 30.
    Each set will start with a line consisting of three numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k, n, e$</span> separated by
    single spaces, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    is the number of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-bit
    numbers to be generated and <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> is the number of edges in the
    graph (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le k \le 100$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \leq 10$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le e \le 2000$</span>). The
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> lines will
    consist of two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_1, v_2$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq v_1, v_2 &lt; 2^ n$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_1 \ne v_2$</span>. Edges are
    undirected and each node is guaranteed to have at least one
    edge. There may be multiple edges between the same pair of
    nodes.</p>
<p>The last test case will be followed by a line with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k = n = e = 0$</span>, which
    should not be processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input case, output a single line consisting of the
    word <tt class="ttfamily">Yes</tt> if the graph is good, and
    <tt class="ttfamily">No</tt> otherwise.</p>
