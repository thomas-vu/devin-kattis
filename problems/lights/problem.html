<div class="problembody">
<p>John has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> light
    bulbs and a switchboard with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> switches; each bulb can be either
    on or off, and pressing the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th switch changes the state of
    bulb <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> from on to off,
    and viceversa. He is using them to play a game he has made up.
    In each move, John selects a (possibly empty) set of switches
    and presses them, thus inverting the states of the
    corresponding bulbs. After exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> moves, John would like to have the
    first <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> bulbs on and the
    rest off; otherwise he loses the game. There is only one
    restriction: he is not allowed to press the same <em>set</em>
    of switches in two different moves.</p>
<p>This is quite an easy game, as there are lots of ways of
    winning. This has encouraged him to keep playing different
    winning games, and now he is intent on trying them all. Help
    him count how many ways of winning there are. Two games are
    considered the same if, after a reordering of the moves in one
    of them, at every step the same set of switches is pressed in
    both of them.</p>
<p>For example, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$n =
    4$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m = 3$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v = 2$</span>, one possible
    winning game is obtained by pressing switches 1, 2 and 4 in the
    first move, 1 and 3 in the second one, and 1, 3 and 4 in the
    last one. This is considered equivalent to, say, first pressing
    1 and 3; then 1, 2, 4; and then 1, 3, 4.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input has at most 500 lines, one for each test case.
    Each line contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 1 000$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq m \leq 1 000$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq v \leq n$</span>). The last line of input will hold the
    values <tt class="ttfamily">0 0 0</tt> and must not be
    processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print one line for each test case containing the number of
    ways John can play the game, modulo the prime <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 567\, 201$</span>.</p>
