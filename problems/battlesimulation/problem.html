<p>A terrible monster is rampaging through Neo Tokyo 5! The
    Earth Defense Force (EDF) has sent a mech unit<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> to defeat the monster. Because there
    is only a single mech unit available after previous monster
    rampages, the EDF has decided to simulate the upcoming battle
    between the mech and the monster before launching an assault.
    The EDF noted that the monster’s attack pattern can be
    simulated by a series of moves that it performs in succession.
    When denoting each of its moves with a single letter, the
    attack pattern can be simulated as a single string, which
    should be read from left to right. The monster has the
    following moves:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Rake, denoted by the letter ‘<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>’;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bite, denoted by the letter ‘<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>’;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Laser breath, denoted by the letter ‘<tt class="ttfamily">L</tt>’.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to defeat the monster, the mech must perform a
    counter move per move that the monster makes:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Slice, denoted by the letter ‘<tt class="ttfamily">S</tt>’, counters the monster’s rake;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Kick, denoted by the letter ‘<tt class="ttfamily">K</tt>’, counters the monster’s bite;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Shield, denoted by the letter ‘<tt class="ttfamily">H</tt>’, counters the monster’s laser
        breath;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there is one catch. When the monster performs a
    subsequent combination of the three moves <em>Rake</em>,
    <em>Bite</em> and <em>Laser breath</em>, in any order, it
    becomes a very powerful attack for which the mech must perform
    a single counter move called <em>Combo breaker</em>, denoted by
    the letter ‘<tt class="ttfamily">C</tt>’. A single <em>Combo
    breaker</em> absorbs the entire combination of three moves. Any
    following moves from the monster will have to be countered
    separately or as part of a new combination. A move of the
    monster can never be part of more than one combination.</p>
<p>Through extensive analysis of the monster’s past behaviour,
    the EDF is now able to reliably predict the actions of the
    monster ahead of time. You are given a string representing the
    moves that the monster will use when battling the mech. The EDF
    needs you to write a program that outputs the sequence of moves
    that the mech must perform in order to defeat the monster.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>A single line containing a string of at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span> characters, consisting
    of the letters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>’, ‘<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>’ and ‘<tt class="ttfamily">L</tt>’.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single string consisting of the letters denoting
    the moves that are to be made in succession by the mech in
    order to defeat the monster.</p>
