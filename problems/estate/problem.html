<p>After recent riots in Flatland, the leader has granted
    permission to purchase real estate at the famous Zero street to
    everyone. Now, not only the noble polygons are allowed to live
    there, but pentagons, squares, and even triangles as well (if
    they can afford a house at Zero street, of course)!</p>
<p>As an employee of the “Integer Estate Agency,” you are in
    charge of the one side of the street. House numbering starts
    right after Zero Square. House #<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is right off of the square, House
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> comes right after
    House #<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, House
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> comes after House
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and so on towards
    Infinity (where, as rumors say, the family of noble Perfect
    Circles live). House #<span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    costs exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$k+1$</span> coins.
    There is no House #<span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>,
    since that is the square.</p>
<p>A promising customer is willing to spend exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> coins to purchase a
    single block of consecutive houses to group together as a condo
    complex. How many options does he have? For example, if he
    wishes to spend <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> coins,
    he may buy houses #<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> (which costs
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2+3=5$</span>), or he may just
    buy house #<span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, so he has
    two options.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There will be up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$50\,
    000$</span> test cases in the input. Each test case will
    consist of a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 1\, 000\, 000$</span>) on its own line, indicating
    the number of coins a customer is willing to spend. The input
    will end with a line with a single <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each customer, output the number of ways he can buy
    consecutive houses spending exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> coins.</p>
