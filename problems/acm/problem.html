<p>Our new contest submission system keeps a chronological log
    of all submissions made by each team during the contest. With
    each entry, it records the number of minutes into the
    competition at which the submission was received, the letter
    that identifies the relevant contest problem, and the result of
    testing the submission (designated for the sake of this problem
    simply as <tt class="tt">right</tt> or <tt class="tt">wrong</tt>). As an example, the following is a
    hypothetical log for a particular team:</p>
<pre>
3 E right
10 A wrong
30 C wrong
50 B wrong
100 A wrong
200 A right
250 C wrong
300 D right
</pre>
<p>The rank of a team relative to others is determined by a
    primary and secondary scoring measure calculated from the
    submission data. The primary measure is the number of problems
    that were solved. The secondary measure is based on a
    combination of time and penalties. Specifically, a team’s time
    score is equal to the sum of those submission times that
    resulted in <tt class="tt">right</tt> answers, plus a 20-minute
    penalty for each wrong submission of a problem that is
    ultimately solved. If no problems are solved, the time measure
    is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<p>In the above example, we see that this team successfully
    completed three problems: <tt class="tt">E</tt> on their first
    attempt (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> minutes
    into the contest); <tt class="tt">A</tt> on their third attempt
    at that problem (<span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> minutes into the contest);
    and <tt class="tt">D</tt> on their first attempt at that
    problem (<span class="tex2jax_process">$300$</span> minutes into the contest).
    This team’s time score (including penalties) is <span class="tex2jax_process">$543$</span>. This is computed to include
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> minutes for
    solving <tt class="tt">E</tt>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> minutes for solving
    <tt class="tt">A</tt> with an additional <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span> penalty minutes for two
    earlier mistakes on that problem, and finally <span class="tex2jax_process">$300$</span> minutes for solving
    <tt class="tt">D</tt>. Note that the team also attempted
    problems <tt class="tt">B</tt> and <tt class="tt">C</tt>, but
    were never successful in solving those problems, and thus
    received no penalties for those attempts.</p>
<p>According to contest rules, after a team solves a particular
    problem, any further submissions of the same problem are
    ignored (and thus omitted from the log). Because times are
    discretized to whole minutes, there may be more than one
    submission showing the same number of minutes. In particular
    there could be more than one submission of the same problem in
    the same minute, but they are chronological, so only the last
    entry could possibly be correct. As a second example, consider
    the following submission log:</p>
<pre>
7 H right
15 B wrong
30 E wrong
35 E right
80 B wrong
80 B right
100 D wrong
100 C wrong
300 C right
300 D wrong
</pre>
<p>This team solved 4 problems, and their total time score
    (including penalties) is <span class="tex2jax_process">$502$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> minutes for <tt class="tt">H</tt>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$35+20$</span> for
    <tt class="tt">E</tt>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$80+40$</span> for <tt class="tt">B</tt>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$300+20$</span> for <tt class="tt">C</tt>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines for <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq n \leq
    100$</span>, with each line describing a particular log entry.
    A log entry has three parts: an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 300$</span>, designating the
    number of minutes at which a submission was received, an
    uppercase letter designating the problem, and either the word
    <tt class="tt">right</tt> or <tt class="tt">wrong</tt>. The
    integers will be in nondecreasing order and may contain
    repeats. After all the log entries is a line containing just
    the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two integers on a single line: the number of problems
    solved and the total time measure (including penalties).</p>
