<p>Finding the convex hull of a set of points is an important
    problem that is often part of a larger problem. There are many
    algorithms for finding the convex hull. Since problems
    involving the convex hull sometimes appear in the ACM World
    Finals, it is a good idea for contestants to know some of these
    algorithms.</p>
<p>Finding the convex hull of a set of points in the plane can
    be divided into two sub-tasks. First, given a set of points,
    find a subset of those points that, when joined with line
    segments, form a convex polygon that encloses all of the
    original points. Second, output the points of the convex hull
    in order, walking counter-clockwise around the polygon. In this
    problem, the first sub-task has already been done for you, and
    your program should complete the second sub-task. That is,
    given the points that are known to lie on the convex hull,
    output them in order walking counter-clockwise around the
    hull.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le n \le 100\, 000$</span>,
    the number of points. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines of input each describe a
    point. Each of these lines contains two integers and either a
    <tt class="ttfamily">Y</tt> or an <tt class="ttfamily">N</tt>,
    separated by spaces. The two integers specify the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>- and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-coordinates of the point. A
    <tt class="ttfamily">Y</tt> indicates that the point is on the
    convex hull of all the points, and a <tt class="ttfamily">N</tt> indicates that it is not. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>- and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-coordinates of each point will be
    no less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1\, 000\, 000\,
    000$</span> and no greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 000$</span>. No point will
    appear more than once in the input. The points in the input
    will never all lie on a line.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>First, output a line containing a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, the number of points
    on the convex hull. Next output <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each describing a point on
    the convex hull, in counter-clockwise order around the hull.
    Each of these lines should contain the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-coordinate of the point, followed
    by a space, followed by the <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-coordinate of the point. Start
    with the point on the hull whose <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-coordinate is minimal. If there
    are multiple such points, start with the one whose <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-coordinate is minimal.</p>
