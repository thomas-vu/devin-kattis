<div class="problembody">
<p>Write a program that reads a list of words from standard
    input and prints out a sorted list of all unique compound words
    that can be made by concatenating two different words from the
    input list. If the same compound word can be formed more than
    one way, it should only be listed once in the output.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input is a list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> words separated
    by whitespace (spaces and / or newlines). There may be more
    than one word on each input line. Each word is a sequence of at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> lowercase
    English letters (aâ€“z). Input ends at end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Your program should print out all unique compound words, one
    per line. They should be printed in sorted (dictionary)
    order.</p>
