</div>Brian and Susan are old friends, and they always dare
    each other to do reckless things. Recently Brian had the
    audacity to take the bottom right exit out of their annual maze
    race, instead of the usual top left one. In order to trump
    this, Susan needs to think big. She will build a house of cards
    so big that, should it topple over, the entire country would be
    buried by cards. It’s going to be huge!

    <p>The house will have a triangular shape. The illustration to
    the right shows a house of height <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>, and Figure 1 shows a
    schematic figure of a house of height <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>.</p>
<p>For aesthetic reasons, the cards used to build the tower
    should feature each of the four suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts,
    spades) equally often. Depending on the height of the tower,
    this may or may not be possible. Given a lower bound
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_0$</span> on the height of the
    tower, what is the smallest possible height <span class="tex2jax_process">$h \ge h_0$</span> such that it is possible
    to build the tower?</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>A single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le h_0
    \le 10^{1000}$</span>, the minimum height of the tower.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>An integer, the smallest <span class="tex2jax_process">$h
    \ge h_0$</span> such that it is possible to build a tower of
    height <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>.</p>
