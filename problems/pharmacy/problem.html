<p>Many pharmacies in the United States fill prescriptions
    strictly on a first-come, first-served basis, even preferring
    prescriptions submitted electronically from a remote site to
    prescriptions dropped off by waiting customers in the store.
    This frequently leads to situations where customers have to
    wait for prescriptions because pharmacy technicians are busy
    filling prescriptions that may not be picked up until much
    later anyway.</p>
<p>This problem asks you to investigate the effect of an
    “in-store customers first” policy. Under this policy,
    technicians fill prescriptions in the order in which they are
    dropped off, but they will not start filling remote
    prescriptions as long as there are in-store prescriptions to be
    filled.</p>
<p>Write a program that computes the average completion time
    for in-store and remote customers under this policy!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line
    contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; n \le 100\, 000$</span>)
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; T \le 10$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> denotes the number of
    prescriptions and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> the
    number of technicians working at the pharmacy. This is followed
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, one line per
    prescription.</p>
<p>Each line consists of one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; d \le 10^9$</span>), which is the time (in seconds) when
    the prescription was dropped off, followed by a single
    character ‘<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>’ or ‘<tt class="ttfamily">S</tt>’ for a remote or in-store prescription,
    followed by a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; k \le 500$</span>) describing the number of seconds it
    takes a technician to fill this prescription. Prescriptions are
    listed in increasing order of drop-off time, but multiple
    prescriptions may be dropped off at the same time, in which
    case preference should be given to any in-store prescriptions,
    regardless of the order in which they appear in the input. If
    two prescriptions of the same type are dropped off at the same
    time, the prescription needing the shorter fill time must be
    filled first, again regardless of the order in which they
    appear in the input.</p>
<p>Once a technician starts working on a prescription, they
    will finish filling it, even if an in-store prescription is
    dropped off while they are working. Each prescription requires
    one pharmacy technician to fill it, and each technician can
    work on only one prescription at a time. The technicians work
    until all prescriptions are filled. You should ignore the time
    it would take for technicians to decide which prescription to
    fill next, so a technician who finishes a prescription can
    start working immediately on the next prescription.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$o$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, denoting the
    average completion time for in-store and remote prescriptions,
    respectively. A prescription’s completion time is defined as
    the time difference between when a prescription was dropped off
    and when it was filled. If there were no in-store or remote
    prescriptions in the input, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> for <span class="tex2jax_process">$o$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> instead. Your answer is considered
    correct if it is within a relative or absolute error of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
