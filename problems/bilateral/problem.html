</div>A friend of yours works at an undisclosed company in the
    music streaming industry, and needs your help. The company has
    offices in Stockholm and London, and collaboration between the
    two offices is extensive. The situation is that each of the
    many but small projects are handled by a two-person team with a
    member in each city. While emails, faxes, and phones are
    wonderful, and work well within each team, the CEO wants a
    briefing every year on the projects. For this purpose the CEO
    invites representatives from the projects to Barbados for a
    week of <del>beach fun</del> presentations of all the projects.

    <p>However, money is tight and a new policy has been created:
    the CEO wants at least one person from each project, and
    additionally, she wants to invite as few people as possible.
    This is where you come in. In order to help your friend get a
    ticket to Barbados, you are to write a program that, given all
    the two-person teams, computes the smallest number of people
    that must be invited in order to get at least one person from
    each project, as well as a list of people to invite. If
    possible (subject to the set of people being smallest
    possible), the list of invitees should include your friend.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le 10\, 000$</span>, the number of
    teams. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines each contain two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$i,j$</span> separated by a space, being the
    employee IDs of the two employees in that team (the first one
    is from Stockholm and the second one is from London). Stockholm
    employees have IDs in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1999$</span> and London employees have IDs
    in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$2000$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2999$</span>. An employee can be
    a member of several teams, but there cannot be several teams
    consisting of the same pair of employees. Your friend has ID
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1009$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output first a single line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> indicating the smallest number of
    employees that must be invited to meet the requirements above.
    Then output <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines
    giving the IDs of employees to invite. If possible (subject to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> being smallest
    possible), the list should contain your friend.</p>
<p>If there are several solutions subject to these constraints,
    anyone is acceptable.</p>
