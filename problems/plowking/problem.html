<div class="problembody">
<p>In the kingdom of Winterfield, there are several cities and
    each pair of cities is connected by exactly one old dirt road.
    The king of Winterfield has decided that he will upgrade some
    of those roads. The set of roads that he upgrades must be such
    that it is possible to get from any city in the kingdom to any
    other city via some sequence of upgraded roads.</p>
<p>Because there is so much snow in Winterfield, the king has
    also decided to plow some of those upgraded roads. The local
    plow company, <i class="itshape">Mr. Plow</i>, and the king
    have agreed on the following: the king labels each of the
    upgraded roads <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \dots ,
    m$</span> (the label of each road is the number of gold pieces
    it costs to plow that road) and each road must receive a
    distinct label. Mr. Plow will plow a set of upgraded roads so
    that it is possible to get from any city to any other city via
    some sequence of plowed roads. Mr. Plow will select the
    cheapest possible set of roads that satisfies the above
    condition.</p>
<p>For example, if the kingdom has six cities and the king
    decides to upgrade and label the 8 bolded dirt roads as
    follows, then Mr. Plow will then plow the roads with labels 1,
    2, 3, 4 and 6 (costing a total of 16 gold pieces).</p>

<p>The king has decided on the number of roads to upgrade, but
    he is not sure how to label them, so he has turned to Barney
    (the kingdom’s mathematician) to help decide. However, the king
    is unaware that Barney is actually invested in Mr. Plow, so
    Barney will choose the set of roads to upgrade and how to label
    them so that the total cost is as large as possible. What is
    the maximum cost of plowing the roads?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 1\, 000\, 000$</span>), which
    is the number of cities, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1 \leq m \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$</span>),
    which is the number of roads to be upgraded.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the maximum possible cost of plowing the roads
    following the rules above.</p>
