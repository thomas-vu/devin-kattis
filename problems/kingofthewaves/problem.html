<p>You are organising a king of the hill tournament, the Buenos
    Aires Paddleboarding Competition (BAPC), with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> participants. In a king of the
    hill tournament, one person starts as a “king” and is then
    challenged by another person, the winning person becomes the
    new king. This is repeated until all participants have
    challenged exactly once (except for the starting person). In a
    paddleboarding match, there are no draws. The person which ends
    up as king, wins the tournament. Since you are the organiser,
    you get to choose the starting person and the order in which
    they challenge the king.</p>
<p>Someone is offering you a substantial amount of money in
    case one of the participants, Henk, ends up winning the
    tournament. You happen to know, for any two participants
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, which of the two would win if
    they were to match during the tournament. Consequently, you
    choose to do the unethical: you will try to rig the game. Can
    you find a schedule that makes Henk win the tournament?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1000$</span>, the number
        of participants. The participants are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$0, \dots , n-1$</span>, where Henk is
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
        follow, where each line has exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> characters (not counting the
        newline character). These lines represent the matrix with
        the information of who beats who, as follows. On line
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>th character is (note that
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq i, j &lt;
        n$</span>):</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>’<tt class="ttfamily">1</tt>’ if person <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> will win against person
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>’<tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>’ if person <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> will lose against person
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>’<tt class="ttfamily">X</tt>’ if <span class="tex2jax_process">$i = j$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a sequence of participants, such that the first person
    starts as king and the consequent participants challenge the
    king. If there is no way to rig the game such that Henk wins,
    print “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”.</p>
