<div class="problembody">
<p>All the street lights of lineland should be coloured red,
    blue, green, yellow, black or white. Red and blue paint comes
    in packages that suffice for two poles, and thereâ€™s some left
    over blue paint in storage. Thus an even number of poles must
    be red and an odd number must be blue. The monochrome paint is
    also sold in packages that suffice for two poles, so the total
    number of white and black poles must also be even. In how many
    ways can the lights be coloured? We consider colouring the
    first light blue and the second green to be distinct from
    colouring the first green and the second blue.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \leq 10^{18}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the number of ways to print <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> street lights in a way that
    satisfies the conditions above. This value might be very large
    so print it modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9 +
    7$</span>.</p>
