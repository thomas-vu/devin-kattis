<div class="problembody">
<p>Daenerys and her fellow friends decided to go on a magical
    adventure to find the mystical scientist to cure her village of
    disease. On her adventure she faces the winter and desert until
    she finally found the genius scientist, and while Daenerys
    explained her dire situation to the scientist, the scientist
    agreed to save her village under one condition.</p>
<p>She must prove her village is worthy of saving by solving
    the following problem: given that numbers are observing
    numerical distancing, which means they each need a space in
    between each digit, provide the sum of two numerically
    distanced numbers. For example, the numerically distanced
    numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\ 4\ 5$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5\ 6\ 7$</span> sum to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9\ 1\ 2$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> different segments:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>The first line will have the number of test cases
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, where
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq t \leq
        10$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first line of each case will contain the first
        positive numerically distanced whole number, which will
        have the number’s digits, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> – <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, be space-separated. The
        amount of digits in this line is <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 9$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second line of each case will contain the second
        positive numerically distanced whole number, which will
        have the number’s digits, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> – <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, be space-separated. The
        amount of digits in this line is <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 9$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the sum of the numerically distanced numbers for each
    of the test cases on one line each.</p>
