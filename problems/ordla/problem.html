</div>The word game Or√∞la has been spreading like wildfire
    through the internet as of late. The game involves having a
    list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> five letter
    English words and the computer secretly picking one of these
    words. The player then guesses words from the list as often as
    they wish, but the fewer guesses the better.
    <p>After each guess the computer gives some hints by colouring
    the letters of the guess word, the colours signifying how close
    the word is to the secret word. The computer colours the
    letters in the following way:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Letters that match the corresponding letters in the
        secret word are coloured green, denoted by <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Letters that are in the secret word but are not in the
        correct location are coloured yellow, denoted by <tt class="ttfamily">/</tt>. If a letter appears more often in the
        guess than in the secret word the computer only colours the
        left-most letters, colouring as many letters as there are
        occurrences in the secret word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rest of the letters are coloured gray, denoted by
        <tt class="ttfamily">X</tt>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As an example, if a player guesses the word <tt class="ttfamily">error</tt> but the secret word is <tt class="ttfamily">racer</tt>, the computer will colour it as
    <tt class="ttfamily">//XXO</tt>.</p>
<h2>Interactivity</h2>
<p>This is an interactive problem. Your solution will be tested
    against an interactive judge which reads the output of your
    solution and prints the input your solution recieves. This
    interaction follows certain rules:</p>
<p>The judge starts by printing one line containing the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 500$</span>), the number of
    words in the list. Next the judge prints <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines containing the words from
    the list, each consisting of five English lower case letters.
    The words are all unique. The judge then chooses one of these
    words at random.</p>
<p>Next your solution guesses a word from the list by printing
    it on a single line. The judge replies by printing a single
    line describing the colouring as described above. If the
    colouring is <tt class="ttfamily">OOOOO</tt> then your solution
    has guessed correctly and should exit. Otherwise your solution
    should guess again as described above.</p>
<p>Make sure to <tt class="ttfamily">flush</tt> after each
    guess, for example using</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">print(..., flush=True)</tt> in
        Python,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">cout &lt;&lt; ... &lt;&lt;
        endl;</tt> in C++,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">System.out.flush();</tt> in
        Java.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The problem comes with a testing tool to help test your
    solution.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>Your solution will be run on <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> test cases. If your solution
    needs <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> guesses to solve
    a test case containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    words, your solution gets <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathrm{max}(0, 1 - (g-1)^2/n)$</span>
    points for that test case. The final number of points is the
    sum of points received in all test cases.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> test cases have <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \leq 10$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> test cases have <span class="tex2jax_process">$10 &lt; n \leq 100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> test cases have <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = 500$</span>.</p>
