</div>While working a night shift at the university as a
    janitor, you absentmindedly erase a blackboard covered with
    equations, only to realize afterwards that these were no
    ordinary equations! They were the notes of the venerable
    <i class="itshape">Professor E. I. N. Stein</i> who earlier in
    the day solved the elusive <i class="itshape">maximum
    quadrilateral problem</i>! Quick, you have to redo his work so
    no one noticed what happened.
    <p>The <i class="itshape">maximum quadrilateral problem</i> is
    quite easy to state: given four side lengths <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1, s_2, s_3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_4$</span>, find the maximum area of any
    quadrilateral that can be constructed using these lengths. A
    quadrilateral is a polygon with four vertices.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line with four positive
    integers, the four side lengths <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_3$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_4$</span>.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$2s_ i
    &lt; \sum _{j=1}^4 s_ j$</span>, for all <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, and that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s_ i \leq 1\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single real number, the maximal area as described
    above. Your answer must be accurate to an absolute or relative
    error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
