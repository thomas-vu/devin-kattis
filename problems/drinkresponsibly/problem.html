<p>The University of Lagado is organising events for the
    upcoming Fresher’s week and has been told — much to the
    surprise of its staff — that some of the undergraduates may
    enjoy a beer tasting. While sourcing a wide variety of drinks
    for the students to taste, the university realised that in the
    interests of safety there should be a limit on the alcohol
    consumption of any student, enforced by a strict limit on the
    amount any individual is allowed to spend.</p>
<p>In common with many popular establishments, the drinks with
    varying strengths are served in varying amounts: Either a
    litre, a half litre or a third of a litre to limit possible
    intoxication. <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\% $</span> of a
    litre at <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\% $</span> strength
    equals one unit of alcohol.</p>
<p>The students are looking forward to the event, but in order
    to make the most of their money and still be bright-eyed and
    bushy tailed for the first week of morning lectures, they don’t
    wish to get too drunk. How can the students spend all their
    money and consume in full their self-imposed alcohol limit for
    the night?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing three numbers:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
            (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0.00 \le m \le
            10.00$</span>), the amount of money they can spend to
            two decimal places;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>
            (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0.0 \le u \le
            20.0$</span>), the number of units they aim to drink to
            one decimal place;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>
            (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le d \le 8$</span>),
            the number of different drinks available.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> lines,
        each containing:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>
            lowercase latin letters (the name of the drink);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> (its strength as a
            percentage);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>its size (either ‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$1/1$</span>’ for a litre,
            ‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$1/2$</span>’ for a half
            or ‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$1/3$</span>’ for a
            third);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a real number to two decimal places; its cost.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Name, strength, price and cost will be separated by
    spaces.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the students’ aims are possible, write one or more lines,
    each listing the name of the drink purchased followed by the
    positive integer count of how many drinks of that type were
    bought. If there are several solutions, output any.</p>
<p>Otherwise, output a single line containing the word
    <tt class="ttfamily">IMPOSSIBLE</tt>.</p>
