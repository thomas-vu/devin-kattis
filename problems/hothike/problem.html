</div>In order to pass time during your vacation, you decided
    to go on a hike to visit a scenic lake up in the mountains.
    Hiking to the lake will take you a full day, then you will stay
    there for a day to rest and enjoy the scenery, and then spend
    another day hiking home, for a total of three days. However,
    the accursed weather this summer is ridiculously warm and
    sunny, and since severe dehydration is not at the top of your
    priority list you want to schedule the three-day trip during
    some days where the two hiking days are the least warm. In
    particular you want to minimize the maximum temperature during
    the two hiking days.
    <p>Given the current forecast of daily maximum temperatures
    during your vacation, what are the best days for your trip?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \le n \le 50$</span>), the length of your vacation in days.
    Then follows a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1, t_2, \ldots , t_ n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-20 \le t_ i \le 40$</span>),
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> is the
    temperature forecast for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>â€™th day of your vacation.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is the best day to
    start your trip, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>
    is the resulting maximum temperature during the two hiking
    days. If there are many choices of <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> that minimize the value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, then output the
    smallest such <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>.</p>
