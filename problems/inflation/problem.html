</div>For NWERC 2018, the organisers have done something rather
    special with the balloons. Instead of buying balloons of equal
    size, they bought one balloon of every integer size from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. A balloon of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> has a capacity of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> decilitres.
    <p>To avoid inflating the balloons by hand, the organisers also
    bought <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> helium gas
    canisters. Each canister can only be used to inflate one
    balloon, and must be emptied completely into that balloon (it
    is not possible to disconnect a canister from a balloon before
    the canister has been fully used).</p>
<p>Unfortunately the gas canisters were bought at a garage
    sale, and may contain differing amounts of helium. Some may
    even be empty! To make the best of this challenging situation,
    the canisters will have to be paired with the balloons
    smartly.</p>
<p>The organisers want to assign all of the gas canisters to
    separate balloons, such that the balloon that is inflated the
    least (relative to its capacity) still contains the maximum
    possible fraction of helium inside. What is the maximum such
    (minimum) fraction that is possible?</p>
<p>Balloons filled beyond their capacity will explode.
    Explosions are upsetting and must be avoided.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$</span>), the
        number of balloons and gas canisters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1, \ldots , c_
        n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le c_ i \le
        n$</span> for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>), the amounts of helium in the
        gas canisters, in decilitres.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is possible to fill all the balloons without any
    exploding, output the maximum fraction <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> such that every balloon can be
    filled to at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> of
    its capacity. Otherwise, output “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”.</p>
<p>Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
