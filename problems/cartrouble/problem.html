<p>The city center of an unnamed Nordic university town
    consists of what was once a medieval city with narrow winding
    streets completely surrounded by a high wall protecting the
    city against Swedish invaders and other unwanted elements. The
    wall has since been removed and replaced by a system of
    interconnecting roads completely circumscribing the old part of
    the town. The roads inside still remains more or less the same
    as it was in the middle ages, which of course comes in conflict
    with modern requirements for accessibility by car, resulting in
    a maze of twisty little one-way streets, all alike, mixed with
    slightly wider two-way streets.</p>
<p>Making changes to the traffic routes in such a city can
    easily cause unexpected side-effects if you do not plan
    carefully ahead. The story goes that a prominent member of the
    city council once submitted a proposal to the council regarding
    extensive changes to how the traffic should be organized in the
    city center. The proposal did have the merit that it would be
    very easy to drive in to the central square, but it would
    unfortunately also be impossible to drive out again. The
    council member in question later went on to become minister of
    justice in the country under the parole that society should be
    harder on criminals – “it should be easy to go to jail, but
    difficult to get out again”.</p>
<p>To avoid mistakes as the one above, the city planners need
    you to develop a tool that can help them discover any traffic
    problems in the planning stage. The planners need to be alerted
    of two different situations. The first situation is that a
    street exists in the city center from which you cannot reach
    the surrounding, circular, system of roads, i.e., you are
    <em>trapped</em> inside the city. The second situation is that
    a street exists in the city that cannot be reached from the
    surrounding system of roads, i.e., it is
    <em>unreachable</em>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a description of how streets connect
    to each other and the surrounding circular road system. Each
    street (or a segment of a street) within the city center is
    represented by an arbitrary integer id number (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0&lt; \text {id}&lt;1000$</span>). The
    surrounding circular road system is represented by the special
    id number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<p>First line: An integer giving the number of streets
    (including the surrounding road system, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0&lt; \text {streets} \leq
    1000$</span>).</p>
<p>The following lines: One line for each street (no particular
    order required and the surrounding road system is included)
    consisting of a number of integers. First an integer giving the
    id number of the street. Second, the number of (other) streets
    that can be reached from this street. Third, a sequence of
    distinct street id numbers indicating which streets can be
    reached from this street.</p>
<h2>Ouptut</h2>
<p>One line for each street on which you would be trapped
    within the city consisting of the text “TRAPPED <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>” where “<span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>” is replaced by street id number
    in question.</p>
<p>Then, one line for each street within the city that is
    unreachable from the surrounding system of roads consisting of
    the text “UNREACHABLE <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>”
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> should be
    replaced by the street id in question.</p>
<p>If no problems are found, i.e., you are not trapped in any
    street and every street is reachable, you should print a single
    line containing the text “NO PROBLEMS”.</p>
<p>If multiple streets cause you to get trapped – or are
    unreachable – you should list them in the same order they were
    entered in the input (within respective category).</p>
