<p>The gopher family, having averted the canine threat, must
    face a new predator.</p>
<p>The are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> gophers and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> gopher holes, each at
    distinct <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span>
    coordinates. A hawk arrives and if a gopher does not reach a
    hole in <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> seconds it is
    vulnerable to being eaten. A hole can save at most one gopher.
    All the gophers run at the same velocity <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>. The gopher family needs an escape
    strategy that minimizes the number of vulnerable gophers.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains several cases. The first line of each
    case contains four positive integers less than 100:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines give the coordinates of the
    gophers; the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines give the coordinates of the gopher holes. All coordinates
    are decimal numbers between 0 and 100 with one digit after the
    decimal point. All distances are in metres; all times are in
    seconds; all velocities are in metres per second.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output consists of a single line for each case, giving the
    number of vulnerable gophers.</p>
