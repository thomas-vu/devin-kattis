<div class="problembody">
<p>You and your sister have to share a large, circular cookie.
    The cookie is quite stale, so you must break it by striking it
    with a hammer. When struck at point <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, the cookie will break along the
    shortest chord containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>. You follow the usual strategy of
    one person breaking the cookie into two parts and the other
    person choosing which part to take. Thus, after the cookie is
    broken, you want to know which part is larger.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> test cases, one per line. Each
    test case is given as three real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, where each value is in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0,20]$</span> with at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> digits past the
    decimal point. All units are given in centimeters. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> value gives the radius
    of an origin-centered cookie. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> values give the coordinates where
    the cookie is struck. No strike will be within <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.001$</span> cm of the edge of the cookie.
    Input ends at end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print a line giving the area of the
    resulting two cookie pieces, larger piece first. Answers should
    be correct to within <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.001$</span> square centimeters. If the
    hammer misses the cookie entirely, simply print out the word
    “miss”.</p>
