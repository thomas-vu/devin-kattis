<p>Zoe and her friends enjoy playing Wordle<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> together and have decided to work
    cooperatively to solve the daily puzzle.</p>
<p>Wordle is a game where players get six attempts to guess a
    hidden 5-letter word. With each word guessed, the system will
    mark each letter with one of three feedback colors:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">Green</tt> - this letter is in the
        word and occurs at this location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">Yellow</tt> - this letter is in the
        word, but not at this location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">Gray</tt> - this letter is not in
        the hidden word (with an exception for duplicate letters,
        see below).</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that duplicate letters can be a little tricky. First,
    <tt class="ttfamily">Green</tt> letters are marked. For a
    single letter, suppose there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> non-<tt class="ttfamily">Green</tt> occurrences in the hidden word and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> non-<tt class="ttfamily">Green</tt> occurrences in the guess. The
    <em>leftmost</em> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\min
    (X,Y)$</span> of the non-<tt class="ttfamily">Green</tt>
    occurrences of this letter will be marked <tt class="ttfamily">Yellow</tt> and the rest will be <tt class="ttfamily">Gray</tt>.</p>
<p>For example, if the hidden word was <tt class="ttfamily">FREED</tt> and a guessed word was <tt class="ttfamily">GEESE</tt>, the feedback would show the second
    <tt class="ttfamily">E</tt> (the third letter) in <tt class="ttfamily">Green</tt>, and the first and third <tt class="ttfamily">E</tt>s (second and fifth letters of <tt class="ttfamily">GEESE</tt>) respectively in <tt class="ttfamily">Yellow</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">Gray</tt>.</p>
<p>Knowing the list of all guessable words, help Zoe determine
    which words are still valid given their original guesses.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 10$</span>), which is the number of guesses Zoe and
    her friends have made, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq W \leq 10^4$</span>), which is the number of guessable
    words.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    describe the guesses. Each line contains two 5-letter strings
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>. The first string, <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>, is the guess which consists only
    of uppercase English letters and is in the list of guessable
    words. The second string, <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>, is the feedback. The feedback is
    composed of the characters <tt class="ttfamily">G</tt>,
    <tt class="ttfamily">Y</tt>, and <tt class="ttfamily">-</tt>,
    respectively indicating <tt class="ttfamily">Green</tt>,
    <tt class="ttfamily">Yellow</tt>, and <tt class="ttfamily">Gray</tt> for the guess.</p>
<p>The last <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> lines
    describe the list of distinct guessable words. Each line
    contains a 5-letter string of uppercase English letters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display all valid words, in the order they appear, from the
    guessable list of words. There will always be at least one
    valid word.</p>
