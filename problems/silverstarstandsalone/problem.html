<p>One of standard units of length used in Solar system
    distance measurements is one astronomical unit, abbreviated as
    AU. It is also used in the following problem.</p>
<p>The exploration probe is being assembled on Mars and it will
    be launched soon. The probe destination is an asteroid named
    Silver Star after its unexpectedly bright ultraviolet albedo.
    The journey of the probe will be long, and it may visit some
    other asteroids on the way. The set of candidate asteroids to
    be visited, including Silver Star, has been carefully chosen so
    that they are on the path from Mars to Silver Star and the
    sequence of their distances from Mars expressed in AU and
    arranged in ascending order, is the sequence of the first few
    prime numbers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$2, 3, 5, 7, 11,
    \dots $</span>. On the journey, not necessarily all asteroids
    between the launch site and Silver Star have to be visited. On
    the other hand, the distance between two consecutive visited
    asteroids can be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span> AU, otherwise the probe would not
    collect enough scientific data. There are two rules, neither of
    which can be broken: First, the closest asteroid, which is in
    distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> AU, will be
    visited, and second, Silver Star will be visited.</p>
<p>There are many possible trajectories of the probe dictated
    by the choice of particular asteroids to be visited. Two
    trajectories are considered different if the sequences of
    visited asteroids in each trajectory differ by at least one
    asteroid. Otherwise they are considered equal. Each trajectory
    contains the launch site asteroid and Silver Star. The probe
    will be moving steadily towards Silver Star, it will never turn
    back. The probe navigation team needs to evaluate the most
    promising trajectories. For that aim, they first need to
    calculate the number of all mutually different probe
    trajectories.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains one line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le P \le 211$</span>), the distance of the Silver Star from
    Mars expressed in AU. <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>
    is a prime number.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the number of different probe trajectories.</p>
