<div class="problembody">
<p>The toilet in Freddy’s garden is broken, so his only chance
    are public toilets nearby. One day, there is a long queue
    of people in front of the toilets. Freddy is in a big need
    and so he desperately wants the queue to be served as quick as
    possible.</p>
<p>To use the toilets, you need to pay 5 crowns. Half of the
    people in the queue have a 5-crown coin and the other half
    only have a 10-crown coin. Initially, the toilet operator
    has no coins, thus, the people in the queue have to reorganize
    so that whenever someone wants to pay with a 10-crown
    coin, the operator has at least one 5-crown coin available from
    previous customers.</p>
<p>The issue is that some of the people in the queue are
    unwilling to give up their spot. Determine in how many ways can
    the people willing to change their position rearrange
    themselves in the queue so that the operator always has change
    available. The positions of those unwilling cannot change (they
    cannot be moved to a later but also to
    an <em>earlier</em> spot in the rearranged queue).
    Furthermore, among those willing to change the position, the
    relative order of those with the same coin must be
    preserved.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains several test cases. Each test case
    consists of one line containing a non-empty string of
    parentheses and dots of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n\le 1\, 000$</span>. A dot indicates
    a person willing to change their position in the queue,
    an opening parenthesis indicates a person unwilling
    to change the position who has a 5-crown coin, and
    a closing parenthesis indicates a person unwilling to
    change the position who has a 10-crown coin.</p>
<p>You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    is even and that the string contains at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$n/2$</span> opening parentheses and at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n/2$</span> closing ones.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, compute the number of ways the queue can
    be rearranged so that the conditions described in the statement
    of the problem are satisfied. Since this number may be too
    large, you are only required to print a single line
    containing one integer equal to the last 6 digits (in the
    decimal representation) of the number.</p>
