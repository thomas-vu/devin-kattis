<p><em>Unununium</em> (Uuu) was the name of the chemical
    element with atom number 111, until it changed to
    <em>Röntgenium</em> (Rg) in 2004. These heavy elements are very
    unstable and have only been synthesized in a few
    laboratories.</p>
<p>You have just been hired by one of these labs to optimize
    the algorithms used in simulations. For example, when
    simulating complicated chemical reactions, it is important to
    keep track of how many particles there are, and this is done by
    counting connected components in a graph.</p>
<p>Currently, the lab has some Python code (see attachments)
    that takes an undirected graph and outputs the number of
    connected components. As you can see, this code is based on
    everyone’s favourite data structure <em>union-find</em><a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>After looking at the code for a while, you notice that it
    actually has a bug in it! The code still gives correct answers,
    but the bug could cause it to run inefficiently. Your task is
    to construct a graph with a given number of vertices and edges
    where the code runs very slowly. We will count how many times
    the third line (the one inside the while loop) is visited, and
    your program will get a score according to this number.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one line with two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, the number of vertices and edges
    your graph should have. Apart from the sample, there will be
    only one test case, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N =
    100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M =
    500$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>:th contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq u_ i, v_ i \leq N$</span>). This
    indicates that the vertices <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> are
    connected with an edge in your graph.</p>
<p>Your graph must not contain any duplicate edges or
    self-loops. That is, <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_
    i$</span> must be different from <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> and all the sets <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ u_ i, v_ i\} $</span> must be
    distinct.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> be the number
    of times the innermost while loop is visited when given your
    test case. Then your score will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$\min (X / 200, 100)$</span>.</p>
<p>You will not get any points for the sample test case.</p>
<h2>Explanations of Samples</h2>
<p>In the sample case, the output contains a graph that causes
    the innermost loop to be visited <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> times. Run the code and see for
    yourself!</p>
