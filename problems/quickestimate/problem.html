<p>Let’s face it... you are not that handy. When you need to
    make a major home repair, you often need to hire someone to
    help. When they come for the first visit, they make an estimate
    of the cost. Here they must be careful: if they overestimate
    the cost, it might scare you off, but if they underestimate,
    the work might not be worth their time.</p>
<p>Because the worker is so careful, it can take a long time
    for them to produce the estimate. But that’s frustrating — when
    you ask for an estimate, you really are asking for the
    magnitude of the cost. Will this be $<span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> or $<span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> or $<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>? That’s all you really want
    to know on a first visit.</p>
<p>Please help the worker make the type of estimate you desire.
    Write a program that, given the worker’s estimate, reports just
    the magnitude of the cost — the number of digits needed to
    represent the estimate.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 100$</span>). The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each contain one estimated
    cost, which is an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{100}$</span>. (Some of the workers
    overcharge quite a bit.)</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each estimated cost, output the number of digits
    required to represent it.</p>
