<p>Kivotos is in deep trouble. Familiar yet different monsters
    had made their appearance all over Kivotos, guarding what seems
    to be False Sanctums. The students plan to destroy these
    sanctums as fast as possible to stop the monster raid.</p>
<p>The hacker group of the Millenium Science School, Veritas,
    is trying to hack through the fifth False Sanctumâ€™s defenses.
    The fifth False Sanctum is guarded by Hod, a large robot which
    was originally the communications unit AI of the Millennium,
    but was hacked by an unidentified AI and now claims itself to
    be the eighth prophet of the Decagrammaton.</p>
<p>The documentation states that Hod has a weak spot in its
    security system, which is represented by a 1-indexed string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. The document states that it is
    possible to project the <i class="itshape">density</i> of a
    continuous substring <span class="tex2jax_process">$S[l,
    r]$</span> in the following way:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Partition the substring <span class="tex2jax_process">$S[l, r]$</span> to multiple substrings
        such that each of the smaller substrings have the same
        characters. For example, the string <tt class="ttfamily">maakkkki</tt> is partitioned to <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> smaller substrings, which are
        <tt class="ttfamily">m</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">aa</tt>,
        <tt class="ttfamily">kkkk</tt>, and <tt class="ttfamily">i</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <i class="itshape">density</i> is estimated to be
        the sum of squares of the lengths of these partitioned
        substrings. Following the previous example, the estimated
        <i class="itshape">density</i> would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$1^2+2^2+4^2+1^2=22$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As the beloved Sensei of Kivotos students, you decide to
    help Veritas to do operations on the string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>. Given the initial state of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, you have to process
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> queries in either of
    the following form:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">1 i c</tt>: Change the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> character of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">2 l r</tt>: Report the projected
        <i class="itshape">density</i> of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S[l, r]$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Constraints</h2>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N, Q \leq 2 \times
    10^5$</span><br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is a string consisting
    of lowercase alphabets at all times<br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le l \le r \le N$</span><br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i \le N$</span></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a two space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>, representing the length of the
    string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and the number
    of queries respectively<br/>
    The second line contains a string of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> characters representing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span><br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines follows, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> line contains 3
    space-separated integers which represents the query type to be
    processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For every query of the second type, print a single integer
    representing the projected <i class="itshape">density</i> of
    the queried substring.</p>
