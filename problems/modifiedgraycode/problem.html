</div>The Gray Code is a well-known binary sequence in which
    successive elements differ by only one bit, and the bit chosen
    to be switched yields the smallest normal binary value not yet
    used. The first element of the sequence is the binary sequence
    corresponding to 0. For example, the 3-bit Gray Code sequence
    is 000, 001, 011, 010, 110, 111, 101, 100. So the element at
    index 0 is 000, the element at index 4 is 110, and so on.
    <p>We want to modify the Gray Code so that successive elements
    differ by an even number of bits, but again the bits selected
    to be changed should yield the smallest normal binary value not
    yet used. We call this the even Gray code. Here are the first 3
    elements of the 5-bit even Gray Code:</p>
<pre>
0   0 0 0 0 0
1   0 0 0 1 1     (2 bits switched – positions 1 and 2)
2   0 0 1 0 1     (2 bits switched – positions 2 and 3)
</pre>
<p>Given an index <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>,
    give the element at index <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> in the 10-bit even Gray Code.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le N\le 500$</span>), which is the number
    of queries that will be made. The remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each contains a positive
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq K \leq 500$</span>) representing the
    index of the 10-bit even Gray Code.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input query, print the 10-bit representation of the
    corresponding even Gray Code element. There may be leading 0’s
    but there should be no spaces between the digits.</p>
