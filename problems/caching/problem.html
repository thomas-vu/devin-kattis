</div>In a distributed system, data is never where you need it,
    and fetching data over a network takes time and consumes
    bandwidth. The problem can be mitigated by adding a cache,
    where a node stores some resources locally and if those
    resources need to be used again, it can simply take them from
    its cache rather than asking someone else for them.
    <p>However, caches have a nasty tendency to fill up, so at some
    point, objects must be evicted from the cache to make room for
    new objects. Choosing what object to remove from the cache is
    not easy and there are several different algorithms to choose
    from.</p>
<p>The marvelous Apes in Computing Machinery have come up with
    a fantastic new algorithm, the Introspective Caching Algorithm,
    named after a city of Peru. It consists of some extra hardware
    (a very small, precognitive monkey) which helps making
    decisions. Since the monkey can see into the future, she knows
    exactly what objects will be accessed and in what order, and
    using this information she will make optimal decisions on what
    objects to remove from the cache. Optimality here means that
    she will minimize the number of times an object is read into
    the cache.</p>
<p>All object accesses go through the cache, so every time an
    object is accessed, it must be inserted into the cache if it
    was not already there. All objects are of equal size, and no
    writes occur in the system, so a cached object is always valid.
    When the system starts, the cache is empty.</p>
<p>You have been tasked with evaluating the monkeyâ€™s
    performance, and feeding her the occasional banana.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three integers, separated
    by single spaces, telling you how many objects fit in the
    cache, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; c \le 10\,
    000$</span>, how many different objects are in the system,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c \le n \le 100\, 000$</span>,
    and how many accesses, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le a
    \le 100\, 000$</span>, will occur. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> lines contain a single integer
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> (inclusive)
    indicating what object is accessed. The first line corresponds
    to the first object accessed access and the last line to the
    last.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the least number of times an object must be read into
    the cache to handle the accesses listed in the input.</p>
