<div class="problembody">
<p>You are given a list of rectangle boundaries. Each rectangle
    boundary is on integer coordinates. The rectangles surround
    squares on the coordinate grid. Your job is to determine the
    total number of such grid squares that are surrounded by at
    least one of the given rectangles.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> cases. Each case starts with the
    number of rectangles <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; n
    \le 50$</span>. Following this are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> rectangles, each given as four
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a &lt; c$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b &lt; d$</span>. The point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a,b)$</span> defines the bottom left corner
    of the rectangle and the point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(c,d)$</span> defines the top right. All
    coordinates are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span> (inclusive). Input ends when
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each set of rectangles, print the total number of grid
    points they surround.</p>
