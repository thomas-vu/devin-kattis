<p>MegaFirm Inc. has created a set of patterns to aid its
    telephone help-desk operators in responding to customers. A
    pattern is a phrase consisting of words and placeholders. A
    word is simply a string of letters. A placeholder is a word
    enclosed in angle brackets (that is <tt class="ttfamily">&lt;...&gt;</tt>). A phrase <em>matches</em> a
    pattern if each placeholder in the pattern can be
    systematically replaced by a word so as to make the pattern and
    phrase equal. By “systematically replaced” we mean that all
    placeholders enclosing the same word are replaced by the same
    word.</p>
<p>For example, the phrase</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<tt class="ttfamily">to be or not to be</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>matches the pattern</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<tt class="ttfamily">&lt;foo&gt; be &lt;bar&gt; not
      &lt;foo&gt; &lt;baf&gt;</tt>
</blockquote>
<p>because we can replace <tt class="ttfamily">&lt;foo&gt;</tt>
    by “to”, <tt class="ttfamily">&lt;bar&gt;</tt> by “or”, and
    <tt class="ttfamily">&lt;baf&gt;</tt> by “be”.</p>
<p>Given two patterns, you are to find a phrase that matches
    both.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100$</span>, the number of test
    cases. Each test case consists of two lines of input; each a
    pattern. Patterns consist of lowercase words, and placeholders
    containing lowercase words. No pattern exceeds <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters. Words contain at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span> characters. A
    single space separates adjacent words and placeholders.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a phrase that matches both
    patterns. If several phrases match, any will do, but all words
    used in the phrase must obey the same constraints as the words
    in the input (i.e., they must be lowercase and of length at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span>). If no phrase
    matches, output a line containing “<tt class="ttfamily">-</tt>”
    (a single minus sign).</p>
