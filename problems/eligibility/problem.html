<p>Every year, students across the world participate in the ACM
    ICPC<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a>. In order to participate in this
    contest, a student must be eligible to compete. In this
    problem, you will be given information about students and you
    will write a program to determine their eligibility to
    participate in the ICPC.</p>
<p>We will start by assuming that each student meets the “Basic
    Requirements” as specified in the ICPC rules—the student is
    willing to compete at the World Finals, is a registered student
    with at least half-time load, competes for only one institution
    in a contest year, and has not competed in two world finals or
    five regional contests.</p>
<p>The rules to decide if a student is eligible to compete in
    the contest year 2014–2015 are as follows:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>if the student first began post-secondary studies in
        2010 or later, the student is eligible;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if the student is born in 1991 or later, the student is
        eligible;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if none of the above applies, and the student has
        completed more than an equivalent of 8 semesters of
        full-time study, the student is ineligible;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if none of the above applies, the coach may petition for
        an extension of eligibility by providing the student’s
        academic and work history.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For “equivalent of 8 semesters of full-time study,” we
    consider each semester of full-time study to be equivalent to a
    student completing 5 courses. Thus, a student who has completed
    41 courses or more is considered to have more than 8 semesters
    of full-time study.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a number of cases. The first line
    contains a positive integer, indicating the number of cases to
    follow. Each of the cases is specified in one line in the
    following format</p>
<pre>
  name YYYY/MM/DD YYYY/MM/DD courses
</pre>
<p>where <tt>name</tt> is the name of the student (up to 30
    alphabetic characters), the first date given is the date the
    student first began post-secondary studies, and the second date
    given is the student’s date of birth. All dates are given in
    the format above with 4-digit year and 2-digit month and day.
    <tt>courses</tt> is a non-negative integer indicating the
    number of courses that the student has completed.</p>
<p>There are at most 1 000 cases.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line of output, print the student’s name, followed
    by a space, followed by one of the strings <tt>eligible</tt>,
    <tt>ineligible</tt>, and <tt>coach petitions</tt> as
    appropriate.</p>
