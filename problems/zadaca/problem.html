<div class="problembody">
<p>Mirko has received a homework assignment to compute the
    greatest common divisor of the two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. Since the numbers are quite
    large, the teacher provided him with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> smaller integers whose product is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> integers with product <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>.</p>
<p>Mirko would like to verify his result, so he has asked you
    to write a program to solve his problem. If the result is more
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> digits long,
    output only the last <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>
    digits.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 1000$</span>).</p>
<p>The second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space-separated positive integers
    less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\,
    000$</span>, whose product is the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>.</p>
<p>The third line of input contains the positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le M \le 1000$</span>).</p>
<p>The fourth line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> space-separated positive integers
    less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\,
    000$</span>, whose product is the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the greatest
    common divisor of numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. If the result is more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> digits long, output
    only the last (least significant) <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> digits.</p>
