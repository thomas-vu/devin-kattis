<p>Your city is deciding whether to raise taxes or lower them
    for the richest residents. Rich people are defined as those
    earning an income equal to or above the mean income, while poor
    people are defined as those earning an income below the mean
    income (mean = average). The city has decided to have an
    in-person public vote to determine which direction taxes on
    rich people will go (either up or down).</p>
<p>The city will raise taxes on rich people if more than half
    of all the people attending the meeting are poor (because there
    are a lot of low income earners to support). But the city will
    lower taxes on the rich if at least half of the people at the
    meeting are rich (since there are lots of rich people, they can
    each pay a little bit less to support the poor
    individuals).</p>
<p>As each person arrives at the meeting, they announce their
    income. If at that instant in time the majority of the people
    (more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/2$</span> of the
    people) in the room are poor, then a spontaneous round of
    applause will occur (the rich people, who are in the minority,
    are going to pay more — YAY!). However, if at the instant
    when the person arriving announces their income at least half
    of the people in the room are rich, then there is silence in
    the room.</p>
<p>Your task is to determine how many times the room erupts in
    applause.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq N \leq 500\, 000)$</span>, the number of people who will
    attend the meeting. This is followed by a single line
    containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    space-separated integer values, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_ N$</span>,
    representing the incomes of the meeting attendees in the order
    they arrive <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq a_ i \leq
    10\, 000)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the total number of times that the
    room erupts in applause.</p>
