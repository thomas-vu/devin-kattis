<p>Once upon a time, in the Kingdom of Loowater, a minor
    nuisance turned into a major problem.</p>
<p>The shores of Rellau Creek in central Loowater had always
    been a prime breeding ground for geese. Due to the lack of
    predators, the geese population was out of control. The people
    of Loowater mostly kept clear of the geese. Occasionally, a
    goose would attack one of the people, and perhaps bite off a
    finger or two, but in general, the people tolerated the geese
    as a minor nuisance.</p>
<p>One day, a freak mutation occurred, and one of the geese
    spawned a multi-headed fire-breathing dragon. When the dragon
    grew up, he threatened to burn the Kingdom of Loowater to a
    crisp. Loowater had a major problem. The king was alarmed, and
    called on his knights to slay the dragon and save the
    kingdom.</p>
<p>The knights explained: “To slay the dragon, we must chop off
    all its heads. Each knight can chop off one of the dragon’s
    heads. The heads of the dragon are of different sizes. In order
    to chop off a head, a knight must be at least as tall as the
    diameter of the head. The knights’ union demands that for
    chopping off a head, a knight must be paid a wage equal to one
    gold coin for each centimetre of the knight’s height.”</p>
<p>Would there be enough knights to defeat the dragon? The king
    called on his advisors to help him decide how many and which
    knights to hire. After having lost a lot of money building Mir
    Park, the king wanted to minimize the expense of slaying the
    dragon. As one of the advisors, your job was to help the king.
    You took it very seriously: if you failed, you and the whole
    kingdom would be burnt to a crisp!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> test cases. The first line of each
    test case contains two integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20\, 000$</span> inclusive, indicating the
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> of heads that
    the dragon has, and the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> of knights in the kingdom. The
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    contain an integer, and give the diameters of the dragon’s
    heads, in centimetres. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each contain an integer, and
    specify the heights of the knights of Loowater, also in
    centimetres. All diameters and heights are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span> centimeters inclusive.</p>
<p>The last test case is followed by a line containing
    “<tt class="tt">0 0</tt>”.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing the minimum
    number of gold coins that the king needs to pay to slay the
    dragon. If it is not possible for the knights of Loowater to
    slay the dragon, output a line containing “<tt class="tt">Loowater is doomed!</tt>”.</p>
