<p>It is common practice among your friends to buy drinks for
    each other.</p>
<p>This all works great as long as everyone takes turns buying
    drinks. However, some of your friends are being accused of
    being cheap, since they haven’t paid for drinks in return. They
    defend themselves saying they bought many drinks for
    others.</p>
<p>You all agree that everyone should receive as many drinks as
    they have bought. But you also agree that it does not matter
    who bought drinks for whom. For example, assume Alice bought a
    drink for Mallory and Mallory bought a drink for Bob. If now
    Bob buys a drink for Alice then everyone has bought and
    received one drink and all outstanding debt is settled.</p>
<p>The bartenders are very busy, so you decide to settle all
    debt but order as few total drinks as possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> of transactions, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 100\, 000$</span>. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines consist of three
    values <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, separated by spaces. This means
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> bought
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> drinks for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is an integer with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq d\leq 156$</span>. Both <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> are different names; each name
    consists of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    characters from the English alphabet; the first letter is
    uppercase and there are no spaces in a name. There are at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> different names in
    the input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines of
    three space separated values <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>. This means that <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> should buy <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> drinks for <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is an integer with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq d$</span>. The number of lines must
    satisfy <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq k\leq
    \frac12n(n-1)$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of different people
    in the input.</p>
<p>This is followed by the word “settled” on a single, final
    line.</p>
<p>If there are multiple valid answers, output any of them.</p>
