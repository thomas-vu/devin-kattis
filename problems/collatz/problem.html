<p>The Collatz Conjecture is an interesting phenomenon. Though
    its principle is very simple, it still remains among unresolved
    problems in mathematics, even after many years of study.
    However, the years of intensive research brought at least some
    results, which is a huge advantage of the human race against
    the aliens, because they did not study the conjecture for so
    many years. We want to keep this advantage.</p>
<p>Imagine a sequence defined recursively as follows: Start
    with any positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_0$</span> (so-called “starting value”).
    Then repeat the following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>if <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> is even,
        then <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{i+1} = x_ i
        /2$</span> (“half …”)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> is odd,
        then <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{i+1} = 3x_ i +
        1$</span> (“…or triple plus one”)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The Collatz Conjecture says that every such sequence will
    eventually reach <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. It
    has still not been proven until today but we already know for
    sure that this is true for every <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_0 &lt; 2^{58}$</span>. (Never tell this to
    aliens!)</p>
<p>In this problem, you are given two starting values and your
    task is to say after how many steps their sequences “meet” for
    the first time (which means the <em>first</em> number that
    occurs in both sequences) and at which number is it going to
    happen. For simplicity, we will assume that the sequence does
    not continue once it has reached the number one. In reality, it
    would then turn into <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 4, 2, 1,
    4, 2, 1, \ldots $</span>, which quickly becomes boring.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\
    500$</span> test cases. Each test case is described by a single
    line containing two integer numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq A, B \leq 1\ 000\ 000$</span>.</p>
<p>The last test case is followed by a line containing two
    zeros.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the sentence “<tt class="ttfamily"><span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> needs
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ A$</span> steps, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> needs <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ B$</span> steps, they meet at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span></tt>”, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ B$</span> are the number of steps needed
    in both sequences to reach the same number <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>. Follow the output format
    precisely.</p>
