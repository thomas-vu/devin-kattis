<p>Minka the Martian is celebrating their birthday with many
    friends. Similar to Earth birthdays, the occasion is
    commemorated by blowing candles out on a cake. However, on Mars
    the candles are placed on the cake differently: each of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> guests attending the
    party will place <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>
    candles on the cake representing the number of hours the
    Martian has been alive. So the cake will have exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \cdot H$</span> candles in
    total. Even more surprising is that each guest hand-crafted the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> candles that they
    placed on the cake, so the candles are not necessarily
    identical.</p>
<p>Minka is not feeling particularly well today and fears they
    won’t be able to blow out all candles. Each candle takes a
    certain effort to blow out, the effort is given as a positive
    integer. Minka has a capacity <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> to blow out candles, which may not
    be enough to blow out all candles.</p>
<p>There is one further complication. Minka wants does not want
    any guest to feel neglected. When they finish blowing out
    candles, the number of remaining candles between any two guests
    should differ by at most one. That is, if for each guest
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> we let <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i$</span> denote the number of their
    candles remaining after Minka blows some out, then it should be
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$|r_ i - r_ j| \leq
    1$</span> for any two guests <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
<p>Determining the maximum number of candles that Minka can
    blow out such that the total capacity of all extinguished
    candles is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> and
    such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$|r_ i - r_ j| \leq
    1$</span> for any two guests <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 100$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq H \leq 1\, 000$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq C \leq 10^9$</span>).</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    describe the candles brought by the guests. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th such line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> integers indicating the effort to
    blow out each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>
    candles brought by guest <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. Each of these values is given as
    a positive integer at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line indicating the maximum number of
    candles that Minka can blow out subject to the restrictions
    mentioned above.</p>
