        Solution to Sample Input 1, with kayaks replaced by canoes
        (cc by-sa NCPC 2017)
      </div>
</div>You are leading a kayaking trip with a mixed group of
    participants in the Stockholm archipelago, but as you are about
    to begin your final stretch back to the mainland you notice a
    storm on the horizon. You had better paddle as fast as you can
    to make sure you do not get trapped on one of the islands. Of
    course, you cannot leave anyone behind, so your speed will be
    determined by the slowest kayak. Time to start thinking; How
    should you distribute the participants among the kayaks to
    maximize your chance of reaching the mainland safely?

    <p>The kayaks are of different types and have different amounts
    of packing, so some are more easily paddled than others. This
    is captured by a speed factor <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> that you have already figured out
    for each kayak. The final speed <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> of a kayak, however, is also
    determined by the strengths <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_2$</span> of the two people in the kayak,
    by the relation <span class="tex2jax_process">$v=c(s_1+s_2)$</span>. In your group you have
    some beginners with a kayaking strength of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ b$</span>, a number of normal
    participants with strength <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_
    n$</span> and some quite experienced strong kayakers with
    strength <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ e$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three non-negative integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span>, denoting the number of beginners,
    normal participants, and experienced kayakers, respectively.
    The total number of participants, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b+n+e$</span>, will be even, at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and no more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>. This is
    followed by a line with three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ n$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ e$</span>, giving the strengths of the
    corresponding participants (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq s_ b &lt; s_ n &lt; s_ e \leq 1\, 000$</span>). The third
    and final line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$m =
    \frac{b+n+e}{2}$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1, \ldots , c_ m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq c_ i \leq 100\, 000$</span> for each
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>), each giving the
    speed factor of one kayak.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the maximum speed that the slowest
    kayak can get by distributing the participants two in each
    kayak.</p>
