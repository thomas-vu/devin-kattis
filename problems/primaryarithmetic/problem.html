<div class="problembody">
<p>Children are taught to add multi-digit numbers from
    right-to-left one digit at a time. Many find the “carry”
    operation – in which a <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    is carried from one digit position to be added to the next – to
    be a significant challenge. Your job is to count the number of
    carry operations for each of a set of addition problems so that
    educators may assess their difficulty.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each line of input contains two non-negative integers with
    less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> digits.</p>
<p>The last line of input contains <tt class="ttfamily">0
    0</tt>. No other line contains <tt class="ttfamily">0 0</tt>.
    There are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>
    lines of input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line of input except the last you should compute
    and print the number of carry operations that would result from
    adding the two numbers, in the exact format shown below.</p>
