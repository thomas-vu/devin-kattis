<div class="problembody">
<p>When using “software-as-a-service” offerings, a user often
    has a problem of matching records stored by the different
    services and determining if they refer to the same entity
    (person, account, order, etc.) The ICPC is no exception. While
    each participant has a record in the central ICPC registration
    system, additional “outside” applications may be used to
    collect and process information for functionality not provided
    by the central system.</p>
<p>Once an “outside” application is used, it becomes necessary
    to match the entries from both systems. Unfortunately, in spite
    of careful directions, sometimes it is not clear if records
    correspond to the same person. The primary sorts of mis-matches
    that occur are these:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>E-mail addresses do not match. This could be due to a
        misspelling, such as <i class="sl">.eud</i> instead of
        <i class="sl">.edu,</i> or different e-mail addresses that
        a participant used in the central ICPC system and the
        outside system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Exact names do not match. This could be due to a typing
        error, or varying use of legal names and nicknames.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Your team is to write a program that will read lists of
    people from the ICPC system and an outside system and determine
    which records in each system do not match a record in the other
    system. Two entries are considered matched if <i class="sl">either</i> the e-mail addresses are an exact match
    <i class="sl">or</i> the last name and first name are an exact
    match.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input to your program is two lists of name and e-mail
    address records. Each record consists of a first name, a last
    name, and an e-mail address, one per line, separated from each
    other by tabs. The first list is the records from the central
    ICPC registration system. This list ends with an empty line.
    The second list is the records from the outside application.
    The second list ends with the end-of-file. (These lists are
    suitable test data, not actual ICPC data.)</p>
<p>E-mail addresses do not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$64$</span> characters in length. E-mail
    addresses consist of lower-case and upper-case English letters,
    digits, and the special characters at-sign, underscore, hyphen,
    and period. E-mail addresses do not begin with special
    characters.</p>
<p>First and last names do not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span> characters in length. Names
    consist of lower-case and upper-case English letters and
    hyphens. Names do not begin with hyphens.</p>
<p>Each input list will contain at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> but not more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000$</span> entries. E-mail addresses
    and (first name, last name) pairings will be unique within each
    list.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Your program is to print lines showing the records from each
    list that could not be matched to the other list. Your program
    is to first print the central ICPC registration records that
    could not be matched, one per line. Each line should consist of
    the letter “<tt class="tt">I</tt>”, a single space, the e-mail
    address, a single space, the last name, a single space, and the
    first name. These are to be printed in lexicographical e-mail
    address order. The e-mail addresses, last names, and first
    names are to be printed exactly the way they appear in the
    input. Once all such records are printed, the outside
    application records that could not be matched are to be printed
    the same way, except that each line should begin with the
    letter “<tt class="tt">O</tt>”.</p>
<p>Case is to be ignored for all record matching comparisons
    and sorting.</p>
<p>Should all records from each system have a match in the
    other system, your program is to print a line containing only
    the string “<tt class="tt">No mismatches.</tt>”.</p>
