<p>Bob Roberts is part of a crack espionage team working for
    the CIA (Chocolate Institute of Alabama) and he is working on
    decrypting the encoded messages of their arch rivals at the NSA
    (Nougat Society of Arkansas). Fortunately, the NSA’s espionage
    staff is not nearly as crack as Bob’s as they are using the
    Hill encryption scheme (described in the previous problem)
    which is susceptible to a known-plaintext attack. Bob has
    intercepted a plaintext/ciphertext pair and has knowledge of
    the size of the encryption matrix used by his not-so-sweet
    enemies. Given these Bob knows that there is a way to determine
    the encryption matrix, but no one on his staff is exactly sure
    how (hmmm <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span> not
    quite as crack as they thought). Bob’s come to you to solve
    this problem for them. One complication is that there might not
    be enough data to uniquely determine the NSA’s encryption
    matrix, and the data they intercepted might have been corrupted
    leading to no solution to the problem.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a line containing a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \leq 10$</span> indicating the
    size of the matrix and the vectors to use in the encryption.
    After this are two lines: the first of these contains the
    plaintext and the second the ciphertext. Both of these lines
    will consist of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000$</span> characters in
    the set <tt class="tt">A</tt>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span>, <tt class="tt">Z,0</tt>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span>, <tt class="tt">9</tt> and the space character. The lengths of both
    strings are identical and are multiples of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Both of these strings may include
    trailing blanks.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one of three possible answers. If the input does not
    admit any possible encryption matrix output <tt class="tt">No
    solution</tt>. Otherwise if the input does not uniquely
    determine the encryption matrix output <tt class="tt">Too many
    solutions</tt>. Otherwise output the encryption matrix, one row
    per line with a single space between values on a line.</p>
