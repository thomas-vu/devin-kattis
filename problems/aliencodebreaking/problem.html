<p>You’ve intercepted encrypted communications between Martian
    diplomats. Since Martian diplomats are often spies, you decide
    to decrypt the messages. While the Martians have skilled rocket
    tech, they lag behind in number theory considerably, which
    compromises their encryption protocol.</p>
<p>Fortunately for you, spies friendly to you have reverse
    engineered the Martian protocol. It turns out that the Martians
    are using a shift-based cipher combined with a very long
    one-time pad. More specifically, the decryption procedure works
    as follows:</p>

<p>Step 1: Define the function <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(x) = (33x + 1) \mod
    2^{20}$</span>.<br/></p>
<p>Further define <span class="tex2jax_process">$f^1(x) =
    f(x)$</span>,  <span class="tex2jax_process">$f^2(x) =
    f(f(x))$</span>,  <span class="tex2jax_process">$f^3(x) =
    f(f(f(x)))$</span>, and so on.</p>
<p>Step 2: Create a <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> size grid, fill the
    upper left corner with <span class="tex2jax_process">$f^1(0)$</span>, the next cell to the right
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$f^2(0)$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f^3(0)$</span> etc. Once the top
    row is filled, continue to the cell below the upper left cell,
    and fill with <span class="tex2jax_process">$f^{X+1}(0)$</span>. Continue this process
    until all rows are filled.</p>
<p>Step 3: Sum all the values in every column, and take those
    values mod <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{20}$</span>.</p>
<p>Step 4: Concatenate the base-10 representations of the
    column sums together, to get a very long base-10 number. For
    instance, if you had column sums of <tt class="ttfamily">10</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">12</tt> for the
    first and second column, the leftmost four digits of the
    resulting value would be <tt class="ttfamily">1012</tt>.</p>
<p>Step 5: Convert the result of step 4 from base <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> to base <span class="tex2jax_process">$27$</span>. This will yield the one-time pad
    the Martians used.</p>
<p>Step 6: For each letter <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> of the intercepted message, shift
    the letter by the amount given by the corresponding digit of
    step 5, base <span class="tex2jax_process">$27$</span>.
    “Shifting” means to add the digit at the corresponding position
    of the pad to the value of the letter in the encrypted message
    and then to compute its remainder modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$27$</span>. You may assume that both the
    encrypted and the decrypted message consist of only uppercase
    English characters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>’ through
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">Z</tt>’ and spaces, which are assigned
    values <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \ldots 26$</span>
    (<tt class="ttfamily">A = 0</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">B =
    1</tt>, ... <tt class="ttfamily">Z = 25</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">SPACE = 26</tt>). Thus, if the encrypted message has
    letter ‘<tt class="ttfamily">D</tt>’ in position <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3^{\text {rd}}$</span> base-<span class="tex2jax_process">$27$</span> digit of the pad is <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span>, then the decrypted letter after
    shifting would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 + 25 = 1
    \mod 27$</span> which is ‘<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>’.</p>
<p>Step 7: Output the decrypted message.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two positive integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 10^6$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le X \le 2.5 \cdot 10^5$</span>). It is guaranteed that the
    base <span class="tex2jax_process">$27$</span> result of step 5
    will be longer or equal to the length of the intercepted
    message. The second line of the input contains a string
    consisting of uppercase letters and spaces of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the encrypted
    text.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the decrypted text.</p>
