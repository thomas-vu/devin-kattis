<p>Bees are one of the most industrious insects. Since they
    collect nectar and pollen from flowers, they have to rely on
    the trees in the forest. For simplicity they numbered the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> trees from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n - 1$</span>. Instead of roaming around all
    over the forest, they use a particular list of paths. A path is
    based on two trees, and they can move either way i.e. from one
    tree to another in straight line. They don’t use paths that are
    not in their list.</p>
<p>As technology has been improved a lot, they also changed
    their working strategy. Instead of hovering over all the trees
    in the forest, they are targeting particular trees, mainly
    trees with lots of flowers. So, they planned that they will
    build some new hives in some targeted trees. After that they
    will only collect their foods from these trees. They will also
    remove some paths from their list so that they don’t have to go
    to a tree with no hive in it.</p>
<p>Now, they want to build the hives such that if one of the
    paths in their new list go down (some birds or animals disturbs
    them in that path) it’s still possible to go from any hive to
    another using the existing paths.</p>
<p>They don’t want to choose less than two trees and as
    hive-building requires a lot of work, they need to keep the
    number of hives as low as possible. Now you are given the trees
    with the paths they use, your task is to propose a new bee hive
    colony for them.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n \leq 500$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq m \leq 20\, 000$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> denotes the number of trees and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> denotes the number of
    paths. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq u, v &lt; n, u \neq v$</span>) meaning that there is a
    path between tree <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>. Assume that there can
    be at most one path between tree <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>, and needless to say that a path
    will not be given more than once in the input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the number of beehives in the proposed colony or
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>’ if its impossible to
    find such a colony.</p>
