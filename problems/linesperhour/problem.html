<div class="problembody">
<p>You are the chief judge for the next ICPC regional contest,
    and you want to make sure that it is theoretically possible for
    a team to solve all problems in the contest, but only if they
    are performing at their peak skill. With your insider
    knowledge, you know that the best team has a fixed limit on the
    number of lines of code per hour that they can successfully
    write.</p>
<p>You have a number of problems to select among and you know
    that each problem has a number of lines of code that would be
    required to solve it. You remember that regional contests are
    five hours long. What is the maximum number of problems you can
    put in the problem set so that the best team has a chance of
    solving all of the problems in the contest?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 50$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$lph$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le lph \le 5\, 000$</span>), where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of
    candidate problems to choose from, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$lph$</span> is the lines of code per hour
    that the best team can successfully write.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$loc$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le loc \le 1\, 000$</span>), which is the
    number of lines of code required to solve that problem.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the maximum number of
    problems that can be put in the problem set so that the best
    team has a chance to solve all of the problems.</p>
