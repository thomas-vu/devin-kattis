<div class="problembody">
<p>Your task is to implement the following C++ functions:</p>
<pre>
#include "vectorfunctions.h"

// Reverse a vector.
// Note that it is sent as a reference, so you should
// reverse the same vector that was sent in.
void backwards(vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; vec){
        ...
}

// Return every other element of the vector, starting with the first.
// You should return a new vector with the answer.
// You are not allowed to modify the vector, even though it is
// sent as a reference. Therefore, the parameter is declared "const".
vector&lt;int&gt; everyOther(const vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; vec){
        ...
}

// Return the smallest value of a vector.
int smallest(const vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; vec){
        ...
}

// Return the sum of the elements in the vector.
int sum(const vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; vec){
  ...
}

// Return the number of odd integers, that are also on an
// odd index (with the first index being 0).
int veryOdd(const vector&lt;int&gt;&amp; vec){
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>The vectors sent has between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> elements. Each number in
    the vector is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$-2000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Template</h2>
<p>You can download the above template as the file <tt class="ttfamily">vectorfunctions.cpp</tt> in the Attachments menu.
    When submitting your solution, send in <em>only this
    file</em>.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>To test your program, you can download the file <tt class="ttfamily">vectorfunctions.h</tt> in the menu to the left,
