<p>The United Cinema Crowd Association of Stockholm plans to
    have a showing of <em>Old computer scientists and their
    pieings</em> at the local KTH Royal Institute of Technology
    cinema. They have received bookings from <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> computer scientists to attend the
    showing. The cinema itself is a grid of seats with dimensions
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R \times C$</span>.</p>
<p>Not until far too late did the auditor of the association
    point out to the board that computer scientists are
    stereotypically introverted. They might even go so far as to
    leave the showing if they have too many people sitting
    nearby!</p>
<p>For a given person, the number of adjacent seats to them are
    the 8 seats which are located at most a single row or column
    away from the person. Your task is to compute how many people
    have <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> adjacent occupied
    seats, for every <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains the integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le R \le 1000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le C \le 1000$</span>), the number of rows and columns of
    seats in the cinema.</p>
<p>The next line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le N \le 1\, 000\, 000$</span>), the number of people who have
    booked a seat at the cinema. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le r \le R$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le c \le C$</span>), meaning that someone have booked the seat
    on row <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and column
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>.</p>
<p>No two bookings will be for the same seat.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> integers â€“
    the number of people who have exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> adjacent occupied seats, for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k = 0, 1, \dots , 8$</span>.</p>
<h2>Explanation of the sample</h2>
<p>In the first example, the cinema is a fully occupied
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \times 3$</span> grid. This
    means that the four people sitting in the corners have three
    adjacent occupied seats, the four people sitting on the sides
    have five adjacent occupied seats, and the person in the middle
    has eight adjacent occupied seats.</p>
<p>In the second example, the situation is similar, except
    there is nobody in the middle. Thus, the people in the corners
    only have two adjacent occupied seats now, and the people on
    the sides have four adjacent occupied seats.</p>
