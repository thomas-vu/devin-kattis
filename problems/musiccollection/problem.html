<p>Audio Phil has a huge music collection, and he is very
    particular about the songs he listens to. Each song has a name
    that is a string of characters. His music player has a search
    feature that lets Phil type a substring into the search box,
    and the player then lists all songs whose names contain the
    substring. If there is exactly one song that matches the
    search, then Phil can hit the Enter key to play that song.</p>
<p>Phil hates using the mouse, and he doesn’t like typing too
    much, so he insists on always typing the shortest possible
    substring that will match exactly the one song that he wants to
    play at this moment. Could you help him find his optimal search
    query?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T, 1 \le T \le 100$</span>.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases follow.
    Each one starts with a line containing a single number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N, 1 \le N \le 100$</span>. The
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each
    contain one song name – these are all of the songs in Phil’s
    collection.</p>
<p>Each song name will consist of only letters, spaces and the
    hyphen character "-". All songs in Phil’s collection will be
    unique and at most 100 characters in length. Song names are
    case insensitive, so "dZihan" is the same is "Dzihan". The
    search algorithm is also case insensitive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing "Case
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>:", where <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is the case number (starting from
    1). After that, print <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines, one for each song in Phil’s collection, in the order
    that the songs were given in the input. For each song, print
    the shortest string of characters that will uniquely find that
    song. If there are several correct answers, print the
    lexicographically smallest one. Put double quotes around each
    string. If there is no correct answer, print ":(" without the
    double quotes.</p>
<p>Note that upper case letters come lexicographically before
    lower case letters, hyphen comes before all letters, and space
    comes before hyphen.</p>
