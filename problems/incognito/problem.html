</center>Spies use attributes to disguise themselves to make
    sure that they are not recognized. For example, when putting on
    sunglasses, a spy suddenly looks completely different and
    cannot be recognized anymore. Every combination of attributes
    gives a different appearance, but not all combinations are
    possible. For example, a hat and a turban are both headgear and
    cannot be used at the same time. Given the list of available
    attributes, compute how many distinct disguises can be made.

    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le n \le 30$</span>): the number of
        available attributes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines with two
        space-separated strings: the name and the category of the
        attribute.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All strings consist of at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> lowercase letters. Within a test
    case all names are distinct.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with an integer: the number of possible
        distinct disguises that can be made with the given
        attributes, such that at most one attribute from each
        category is used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
