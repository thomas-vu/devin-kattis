<div class="problembody">
<p>You have a fence post located at the point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span> in the plane, to which a goat
    is tethered by a rope. You also have a house, which you model
    as an axis-aligned rectangle with diagonally opposite corners
    at the points <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1)$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2, y_2)$</span>. You want
    to pick a length of rope that guarantees the goat cannot reach
    the house.</p>
<p>Determine the minimum distance from the fence post to the
    house, so that you can make sure to use a shorter rope.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing six
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_2$</span>, each in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-999, 999]$</span>.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1
    &lt; x_2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1 &lt;
    y_2$</span>, and that <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,
    y)$</span> is strictly outside the axis-aligned rectangle with
    corners at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1)$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2, y_2)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the minimum distance from the goatâ€™s post to the
    house, with a relative or absolute error no more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.001$</span>.</p>
