<div class="problembody">
<p>One of the most important inventions for modern-day city
    life is the public transportation. However, most people
    probably do not think of it that way â€“ even though it makes
    travel in the city a lot easier, we generally want to spend as
    little time as possible on the subway.</p>
<p>After your experience in NWERC 2009, Nuremberg holds a
    special place in your heart, and some years later you decide to
    move here. Your only problem is to figure out which part of
    Nuremberg to move to. Naturally, you want to move to a nice
    neighborhood, but since most parts of the city are nice there
    are still a lot of choices. Being naturally averse to spending
    hours each day on commuting, you instead decide to choose a
    place based on the amount of time you will have to spend on the
    subway.</p>
<p>Now, if you were only going to go to one place, it would be
    easy to find the best place to live. But of course, there are
    several places where you anticipate that you will go regularly,
    such as work, friends, and the occasional Christkindlesmarkt.
    In order to be able to work this out, you have written a list
    of all the places which you want to visit regularly, along with
    estimates of how often you want to go there. For simplicity,
    you assume that you will always go somewhere and then back
    home, e.g., if you are going to Christkindlesmarkt after work
    you will drop by your house on the way from work before going
    to the markt, rather than going to the markt directly from
    work. Now, you have to find the place to live for which the
    total travel time is minimal.</p>
<p>Because Nuremberg has an extensive public transportation
    system, you will be using the subway for traveling. The subway
    net is quite big, but is still fairly easily maneuvered because
    it is shaped like a tree. In other words, there is always a
    unique path between any pair of subway stations. (This is not
    quite true for the Nuremberg subway of today, but when you move
    here in a few years, we anticipate that it will be true.)</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several test cases. The first line of
    input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le c \le 200$</span>), giving the number of test cases. Then,
    each test case starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 50\, 000$</span>), giving the number of subway
    stations in Nuremberg. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> lines, describing the subway
    net. Each of these lines contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le a, b \le n$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le t \le 300$</span>), indicating that stations <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> are adjacent and that it takes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> seconds to travel
    between them. This is followed by a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le m \le n$</span>), denoting the number
    of stations which you want to go to regularly. Then follow
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines. Each of these
    lines contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le a \le n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le f \le
    500$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is
    the station you want to visit and <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> is the number of times you want to
    visit this station in a year. No station will occur in this
    list more than once.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, first output a line containing the
    number of seconds spent in traffic during a year, provided you
    choose an optimal place to live. Following this line, output a
    line giving all optimal choices of subway stations, separated
    by single spaces and in increasing order.</p>
