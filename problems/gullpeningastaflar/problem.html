<p>In front of you there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> stacks, each containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> gold coins. Only one
    of these stacks contains real gold coins, the other stacks
    contain counterfeit coins. The counterfeit coins are very well
    made and are nearly indistinguishable from the real ones. The
    only difference is in their weight and even that one is minute.
    The counterfeit coins weigh <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> units each and the real gold coins
    weigh <span class="tex2jax_process">$n+1$</span> units
    each.</p>
<p>Your goal is to find the stack of real gold coins, so that
    you may take the coins and leave the worthless counterfeit
    coins behind. Since it is difficult to discern between the
    coins based on their weights, you have brought a scale. You can
    take as many coins from each stack as you wish and place them
    on the scale. The scale will then show you the total weight of
    the coins. The coins then go to their respective stacks after
    each use of the scale.</p>
<p>Can you find which stack contains real gold in as few
    weighings as possible?</p>
<h2>Interactivity</h2>
<p>This is an interactive problem. Your program will be tested
    against an interactive judge which reads the output of your
    program and prints the input your program receives. This
    interaction follows certain rules:</p>
<p>Your program should first read one line with one integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. In the secret test
    cases the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    will always be <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 024$</span>,
    but in the samples <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is
    smaller.</p>
<p>Then your program can either make a final guess or ask
    questions to obtain information.</p>
<p>In order to ask a question, your program must write a line
    starting with the symbol <tt class="ttfamily">?</tt> and then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space separated
    integers, denoting how many coins from each stack you place on
    the scale. Your program should then read one line with one
    integer, the total weight of the coins on the scale.</p>
<p>Once your program has determined the answer, it should write
    out the symbol <tt class="ttfamily">!</tt> followed by a space
    and an integer denoting the number of the stack. The stacks are
    numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. If the answer is
    incorrect, the program will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.
    Otherwise, it will be scored as described below.</p>
<p>The task has a testing tool attached to help test your
    solution.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>Your program will be run on many test cases and the worst
    result over all test cases will be used as the final score.
    Your program is scored by the number of questions it asks. If
    your program asks fewer than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2n$</span> questions, it will receive a
    score. Fewer questions result in a higher score and the maximum
    score is <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>. If your
    program asks <span class="tex2jax_process">$2n$</span> or more
    questions, it will receive a Wrong Answer verdict.</p>
