<p>You have a bunch of audio amplifiers which you have been
    given by your uncle, who has too much stuff lying around. An
    amplifier takes an audio signal as input and produces the same
    signal frequencies as output, but with a possibly different
    volume level. It multiplies the input signal by some constant
    factor to produce its output. You want to string them together
    in sequence to produce a desired volume level for your
    speakers. Using each amplifier at most once, how close can you
    get, without going over your desired volume?</p>
<p>For example, suppose that your music player is producing a
    volume level of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and
    you want to amplify this signal to a volume level of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$80$</span>. You have three
    amplifiers that multiply the volume input to them by factors of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>, respectively. If you use the
    latter two amplifiers in sequence, it will produce the desired
    volume level. However, if your desired volume level was
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$35$</span>, then the closest you
    can get is <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n \le 10$</span> indicating the number
    of test cases that follow. Each test case has two lines. The
    first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a \le 100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le y \le 10\, 000\, 000$</span>,
    indicating the number of amplifiers and the target
    amplification, respectively. The second line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> amplifier
    descriptions, given as space-separated integers. Each amplifier
    description is an integer in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1,100]$</span>, indicating the amplifierâ€™s
    multiplication factor.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Assume that the output from your music player is at volume
    level <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. For each test
    case with goal amplification <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, give the closest output level you
    can achieve that is <span class="tex2jax_process">$\le
    y$</span> using a series of <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> or more amplifiers.</p>
