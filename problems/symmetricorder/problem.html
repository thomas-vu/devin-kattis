<div class="problembody">
<p>In your job at Albatross Circus Management (yes, it’s run by
    a bunch of clowns), you have just finished writing a program
    whose output is a list of names in nondescending order by
    length (so that each name is at least as long as the one
    preceding it). However, your boss does not like the way the
    output looks, and instead wants the output to appear more
    symmetric, with the shorter strings at the top and bottom and
    the longer strings in the middle. His rule is that each pair of
    names belongs on opposite ends of the list, and the first name
    in the pair is always in the top part of the list. In the first
    example set below, Bo and Pat are the first pair, Jean and
    Kevin the second pair, etc.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one or more sets of strings, followed
    by a final line containing only the value <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. Each set starts with a line
    containing an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, which is the number of strings in
    the set, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    strings, one per line, sorted in nondescending order by length.
    None of the strings contain spaces. There is at least one and
    no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> strings
    per set. Each string is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> characters long.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input set print “<tt class="ttfamily">SET</tt>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>” on a line, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> starts at 1, followed
    by the output set as shown in the sample output.</p>
