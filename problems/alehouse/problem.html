<p>Making friends can seem impossible, but going to the
    alehouse makes it easy — it is actually the only way to make
    friendships. Luckily, the alehouse is extremely good at its
    task: if two people are inside simultaneously, they instantly
    become friends. People even become friends if they meet each
    other in the door as one leaves and one enters the
    alehouse!</p>
<p>In Consistentville, each of its <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> residents goes to the alehouse
    exactly once each week, and always during the same milliseconds
    as the week before. This is convenient for everyone, since then
    nobody needs to befriend new people all the time, which can be
    quite exhausting.</p>
<p>You are contemplating a move to Consistentville in order to
    adopt their well-ordered lifestyle, and have decided that you
    want as many friends as possible. However, you don’t actually
    enjoy ale that much, so you decide to limit your weekly visit
    at the alehouse to at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> milliseconds. What is the maximum
    number of friends you can get?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100\, 000$</span>), and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq k &lt; 604\, 800\, 000$</span>). The
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines describe at
    which millisecond each of the original residents of
    Consistentville enters and leaves the alehouse every week.
    Specifically, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text
    {th}}$</span> line consists of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a_ i \leq b_ i &lt; 604\, 800\,
    000$</span>) indicating that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> resident enters the
    alehouse at millisecond <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
    i$</span> and leaves the alehouse at millisecond <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> each week.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single integer, the maximum number of friends you can
    get.</p>
