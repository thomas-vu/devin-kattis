<div class="problembody">
<p>You are a hunter chasing a monkey in the forest, trying to
    shoot it down with your all-powerful automatic machine gun. The
    monkey is hiding somewhere behind the branches of one of the
    trees, out of your sight. You can aim at one of the trees and
    shoot; your bullets are capable of going through the branches
    and killing the monkey instantly if it happens to be in that
    tree. If it isn’t, the monkey takes advantage of the time it
    takes you to reload and takes a leap into a neighbouring tree
    without you noticing. It never stays in the same place after a
    shot. You would like to find out whether there is an strategy
    that allows you to capture the monkey for sure, irrespective of
    its initial location and subsequent jumps. If so, you need to
    determine the shortest sequence of shots guaranteeing this.</p>

<p>As an example, consider the situation in which there are
    only two neighboring trees in the forest (left hand side of the
    figure). It is then possible to make sure you capture the
    monkey by shooting twice at the same tree. Your first shot
    succeeds if the monkey happened to be there in the first place.
    Otherwise, the monkey was behind the other tree and it will
    necessarily have moved when you shoot for the second time.</p>
<p>However, depending on the shape of the forest it may not
    possible for you to ensure victory. One example of this is if
    there are three trees, all connected to one another (right hand
    side of the figure). No matter where you aim at, there are
    always two possible locations for the monkey at any given
    moment. (Note that here we are concerned with the worst-case
    scenario where the monkey may consistently guess your next
    target tree).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several test cases, at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$85$</span>, separated by single
    blank lines. Each test case begins with a line containing two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 21$</span>); <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of trees in the
    forest, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the
    number of adjacency relations between trees. Each of the
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
    contains two distinct integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n - 1$</span> (inclusive), the identifiers
    of the trees in an adjacent pair. The order of both trees
    within a pair carries no meaning, and no pair appears more than
    once. You may further assume that no tree is adjacent to
    itself, and there is always a path between any two trees in the
    forest.</p>
<p>The test cases will finish with a line containing only two
    zeros (also preceded with a blank line).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a line for each test case. The line should contain the
    single word <tt class="ttfamily">Impossible</tt> if the task is
    impossible. Otherwise, it must contain the shortest sequence of
    shots with the required property, in the format <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>: <span class="tex2jax_process">$V_1$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$V_2$</span> …<span class="tex2jax_process">$V_ L$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> is the length of the sequence, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$V_1, V_2 , \ldots , V_ L$</span>
    are space-separated integers containing the identifiers of the
    trees to shoot at in the right order. If several shortest
    sequences exist, print the lexicographically smallest one. (A
    sequence is smaller than another in lexicographic order if the
    first element on which they differ is smaller in the first
    one).</p>
