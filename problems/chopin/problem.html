<p>Frederic Chopin was a Polish music composer who lived from
    1810–1849. One of his most famous works was his set of
    preludes. These <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>
    pieces span the <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>
    musical keys (there are musically distinct <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> scale notes, and each may use
    major or minor tonality). The <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> distinct scale notes
    are:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    \begin{array}{|*{12}{c|}} \hline 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 4
    &amp; 5 &amp; 6 &amp; 7 &amp; 8 &amp; 9 &amp; 10 &amp; 11 &amp;
    12 \\ A &amp; A\sharp = B\flat &amp; B &amp; C &amp; C\sharp =
    D\flat &amp; D &amp; D\sharp = E\flat &amp; E &amp; F &amp;
    F\sharp = G\flat &amp; G &amp; G\sharp = A\flat \\ \end{array}
    \]</span>
<p>Five of the notes have two alternate names, as is indicated
    above with the equals sign (e.g. <span class="tex2jax_process">$C\sharp = D\flat $</span> means that note
    has two names, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C\sharp $</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$D\flat $</span>). Thus,
    there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span> possible
    names for the scale notes, but only <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> musically distinct notes. When
    using one of these as the keynote for a musical key, we can
    further distinguish between the major and minor tonalities.
    This gives <span class="tex2jax_process">$34$</span> possible
    keys, of which <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span> are
    musically distinct.</p>
<p>In naming his preludes, Chopin used all the keys except for
    the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> (which
    were named instead by their alternate names):</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \begin{array}{*{5}{c}} A\flat \text {
    minor} &amp; A\sharp \text { major} &amp; A\sharp \text {
    minor} &amp; C\sharp \text { major} &amp; D\flat \text { minor}
    \\ D\sharp \text { major} &amp; D\sharp \text { minor} &amp;
    G\flat \text { major} &amp; G\flat \text { minor} &amp; G\sharp
    \text { major} \end{array} \]</span>
<p>Write a program that, given the name of a key, will give an
    alternate name (if it has an alternate) or report that the key
    name is unique.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input line contains one test case. There are at least
    one and at most five cases, and the end of input is at the end
    of file. Each line has the format “<tt class="tt">note
    tonality</tt>”, where <tt class="tt">note</tt> is one of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span> names for the scale
    notes given above, and <tt class="tt">tonality</tt> is either
    <tt class="tt">major</tt> or <tt class="tt">minor</tt>. All
    note names will be upper-case, and the two accidentals
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$\sharp $</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\flat $</span>) will be written
    as <tt class="tt">#</tt> and <tt class="tt">b</tt>,
    respectively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, output ‘<tt class="tt">Case X:</tt>’ (where
    <tt class="tt">X</tt> is the case number starting at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>), followed by a space.
    Then output the alternate key name, if it exists, or print
    <tt class="tt">UNIQUE</tt> if the key name is unique.</p>
