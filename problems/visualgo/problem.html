<p><span class="scshape">VisuAlgo</span> (http://visualgo.net)
    is a website developed by a team of staff and students of
    School of Computing, National University of Singapore, the host
    of the 2015 ACM-ICPC Asia Singapore Regional. VisuAlgo
    visualizes a number of popular data structures and algorithms
    in the Computer Science curriculum. Currently, it receives
    approximately 2000 hits/day from CS students and instructors
    worldwide.</p>
<p>One new feature of <span class="scshape">VisuAlgo</span> is
    the online quiz. As an example, the above figure shows a
    question about the classic Single-Source (Single-Destination)
    Shortest Paths problem in graph theory. The beauty of this
    online quiz feature is that the question parameters are
    <b class="bfseries">randomized</b>. The drawn graph <b class="bfseries">G</b> is taken from a collection of hundreds of
    directed weighted graphs (with their 2-D layouts) in
    <span class="scshape">VisuAlgo</span>’s internal database. The
    graph <b class="bfseries">G</b> has <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> vertices numbered from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0..V-1]$</span>. The source
    vertex <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and the
    destination vertex <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> are
    selected at random from <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0..V-1]$</span>.</p>
<p>However, such randomization of the question parameters may
    produce either a trivial question (e.g. “No Answer” when
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> are disconnected, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> when <span class="tex2jax_process">$s = t$</span>, simple tracing of a path if
    there is only a single unique path from <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> as shown in the above figure) or
    insanely difficult question to be computed manually if there
    are too many possible shortest paths from <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>.</p>
<p>The developers of <span class="scshape">VisuAlgo</span> want
    to calibrate such Shortest Paths question with randomized
    parameters so that it is possible for a normal Computer Science
    student to answer the randomly generated question manually
    within a reasonable amount of time. Please help them.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two non-negative integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq V \leq 10\, 000$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq E \leq 200\,
    000$</span>, giving the number of vertices and edges of the
    drawn graph <b class="bfseries">G</b>.</p>
<p>Thereafter follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> lines, each describing the
    directed weighted edges in <b class="bfseries">G</b> by three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq u, v \leq
    V-1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq w \leq
    99$</span> (<span class="scshape">VisuAlgo</span> limits the
    edge weight to be at most 2 characters for visual aesthetic
    purpose), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> are the
    vertex numbers and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> is the weight of the directed edge
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u \rightarrow v$</span>. It is
    guaranteed that <b class="bfseries">G</b> is a simple graph
    without self-loops or multiple directed edges with the same
    direction between the same pair of vertices.</p>
<p>Finally, there are two integers in the last line of input
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq s, t \leq
    V-1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a line with the number of different shortest paths
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> in <b class="bfseries">G</b>. Two shortest paths <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_2$</span> are considered different if
    there exists at least one edge in <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1$</span> that is not found in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_2$</span>. It is guaranteed
    that the answer fits in a 32-bit signed integer data type.</p>
