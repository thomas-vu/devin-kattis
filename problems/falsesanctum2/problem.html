<p>At the other side of Kivotos, the Trinity General School
    detected an abnormally high number of monsters in the schoolâ€™s
    underground system. While many students are trying their best
    to fend off the monsters, Mika charges in to the center of the
    anomaly, hoping to find a way to stop the monster raid. Mika
    finds an obelisk with high concentrations of energy, which is
    the source of energy of the monsters.</p>
<p>Upon touching the obelisk, a lowercase alphabet letter
    string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is displayed in a
    hologram. From the given string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, a key must be retrieved to shut
    down the obelisk. The key of the string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is defined to be the <b class="bfseries">shortest</b> substring such that it is possible to
    construct the original string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> from the substring by
    concatenating and overlapping operations.</p>
<p>For example, the key to the string <tt class="ttfamily">abbabbababbab</tt> is <tt class="ttfamily">abbab</tt>, as the string can be composed of the key
    like the following:</p>
<p>S = abbabbababbab key = abbab abbab abbab</p>
<p>As the beloved Sensei of Kivotos students, you decide to
    help Mika to find the key of string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 10^7$</span>), the length of the string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>.</p>
<p>The second line contains the string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> consisting of lowercase alphabet
    letters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the length of the key.</p>
