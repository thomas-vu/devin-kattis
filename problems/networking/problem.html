<p>Gustaf will graduate next year and needs to choose his final
    courses to study before starting his thesis project. Each
    course provides a certain number of credits, but as a true
    academic weapon, he already has more than enough credits to
    graduate. His real goal is to study as much as possible, but
    the university has blocked him from studying more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> credits because it is
    becoming too expensive.</p>
<p>Gustaf now needs your help to figure out which courses to
    take to maximize the amount of credits without breaking the
    university’s limit. "Easy!", you say, "I learned this in
    algodat!". But Gustaf has an additional requirement. Each
    course has a lecturer, and he does not want to take two courses
    given by the same lecturer (each new lecturer he meets is a new
    potential connection on LinkedIn!).</p>
<p>Of course, he could have done it himself, with all the
    courses he has taken he is more than capable, but he is waiting
    for an important email and is afraid that he will miss it if he
    looks away.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers, the number of courses
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 10^3$</span>, and
    the maximum amount of credits he can take <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le K \le 10^4$</span>. Each of the next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines describe a
    course by giving its credits <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le d \le K$</span>, followed by a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, the name of the lecturer. The
    strings only contain lowercase characters between ’a’ and ’z’,
    and are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> characters in
    length.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum amount of credits <span class="tex2jax_process">$\le K$</span> that Gustaf can take without
    taking two courses with the same lecturer.</p>
