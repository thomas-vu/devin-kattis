<div class="problembody">
<p>Marika has two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. She wants <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> to be divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. She can pay <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> coin to increase or decrease
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. What is the minimum number of
    coins she must pay?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line contains the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le A, B \le 10^{15}$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line with the minimum number of coins Marika
    must pay.</p>
<h2>Explanation of sample 1</h2>
<p>In the first example, she can pay <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> coins to increase <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> from <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>, which <span class="tex2jax_process">$A = 49$</span> is divisible with.</p>
