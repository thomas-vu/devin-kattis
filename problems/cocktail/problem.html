        Getting the “A Furious Cocktail” advancement
      </div>
</div>
<p>In Minecraft, potions can be made and drank. When drank,
    they apply the corresponding potion effect to the player for
    some specified amount of time. “A Furious Cocktail” is the name
    of the advancement where a player has every potion effect
    applied at the same time. This is a challenging feat, as it
    takes time to drink each potion, and only one potion can be
    drank at a time.<br/></p>
<p>Suppose that in your inventory, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> unique potions that have a time
    duration of <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1, \ldots , t_
    N$</span> seconds, respectively. Assuming that it takes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> seconds to drink a
    potion, is it possible to have all <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> potion effects applied at the same
    time? Note that if one potion’s effect ends at the same time
    you finish drinking another potion, the potions are not
    considered to be applied at the same time.<br/></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; N &lt; 1\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 10$</span>, the
    number of potions in your inventory and time in seconds it
    takes to drink each potion, respectively. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each consists of an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq t_ i \leq 10^6$</span>,
    the time duration of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th potion where <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> ranges from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.<br/></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “YES” if it is possible to have all <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> potion effects applied at the same
    time, “NO” if otherwise.<br/></p>
