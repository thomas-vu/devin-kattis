<div class="problembody">
<p>The past few years have seen a revolution in user interface
    technology. For many years, keyboards and mice were
    <em>the</em> tools used to interact with computers. But with
    the introduction of smart phones and tablets, people are
    increasingly using their computers by tapping and moving their
    fingers on the screen. Naturally this has led to new paradigms
    in user interface design. One important principle is that
    objects on the display obey “physical” laws. In this problem,
    you will see an example of this.</p>
<p>You have been hired to build a simulator for the window
    manager to be used in the next generation of smart phones from
    Advanced Cellular Manufacturers (ACM). Each phone they produce
    will have a rectangular screen that fully displays zero or more
    rectangular windows. That is, no window exceeds the boundaries
    of the screen or overlaps any other window. The simulator must
    support the following commands.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="tt">OPEN <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span></tt> — open a new window
        with top-left corner coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span>, width <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> pixels and height <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> pixels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="tt">CLOSE <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span></tt> — close an open
        window that includes the pixel at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span>. This allows a user to tap
        anywhere on a window to close it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="tt">RESIZE <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span></tt> — set the dimensions
        of the window that includes the pixel at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> to width <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and height <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>. The top-left corner of the
        window does not move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="tt">MOVE <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ x$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ y$</span></tt> — move the window
        that includes the pixel at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span>. The movement is either
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ x$</span> pixels in the
        horizontal direction or <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_
        y$</span> pixels in the vertical direction. At most one of
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ x$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ y$</span> will be
        non-zero.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <tt class="tt">OPEN</tt> and <tt class="tt">RESIZE</tt>
    commands succeed only if the resulting window does not overlap
    any other windows and does not extend beyond the screen
    boundaries. The <tt class="tt">MOVE</tt> command will move the
    window by as many of the requested pixels as possible. For
    example, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ x$</span> is 30
    but the window can move only 15 pixels to the right, then it
    will move 15 pixels.</p>

</div>
<p>ACM is particularly proud of the <tt class="tt">MOVE</tt>
    command. A window being moved might “bump into” another window.
    In this case, the first window will push the second window in
    the same direction as far as appropriate, exactly as if the
    windows were physical objects. This behavior can cascade – a
    moving window might encounter additional windows which are also
    pushed along as necessary. Figure 1 shows an example with
    three windows, where window A is moved to the right, pushing
    the other two along.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{\max }$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_{\max }$</span>, the
    horizontal and vertical dimensions of the screen, measured in
    pixels. Each is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> (ACM is planning on building
    displays with very high resolution). The top-left pixel of the
    screen has coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span>. Each of the following lines
    contains a command as described above. One or more spaces
    separate the command name and the parameters from each other.
    The command parameters are integers that satisfy these
    conditions: <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x &lt;
    x_{\max }$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq y &lt;
    y_{\max }$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq w,h
    \leq 10^9$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$|d_
    x|,|d_ y| \leq 10^9$</span>. There will be at most 256
    commands.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output must follow the format illustrated in the sample
    output below.</p>
<p>Simulate the commands in the order they appear in the input.
    If any errors are detected during a command’s simulation,
    display the command number, command name, and the first
    appropriate message from the following list, and ignore the
    results of simulating that command (except as noted).</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="tt">no window at given position</tt>
        — for the <tt class="tt">CLOSE</tt>, <tt class="tt">RESIZE</tt>, and <tt class="tt">MOVE</tt> commands
        — if there is no window that includes the pixel at the
        specified position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="tt">window does not fit</tt> — for the
        <tt class="tt">OPEN</tt> and <tt class="tt">RESIZE</tt>
        commands — if the resulting window would overlap
        another window or extend beyond the screen boundaries.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="tt">moved <span class="tex2jax_process">$d’$</span> instead of <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span></tt> — for the <tt class="tt">MOVE</tt> command — if the command asked to move
        a window <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> pixels,
        but it could only move <span class="tex2jax_process">$d’$</span> pixels before requiring a
        window to move beyond the screen boundaries. The values
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d’$</span> are the absolute number of
        pixels requested and moved, respectively. The window is
        still moved in this case, but only for the smaller
        distance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After all commands have been simulated and any error
    messages have been displayed, indicate the number of windows
    that are still open. Then for each open window, in the same
    order that they were opened, display the coordinates of the
    top-left corner <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span>,
    the width, and the height.</p>
