</div>The gaming company Sandstorm is developing an online two
    player game. You have been asked to implement the ranking
    system. All players have a rank determining their playing
    strength which gets updated after every game played. There are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> regular ranks, and an
    extra rank, “Legend”, above that. The ranks are numbered in
    decreasing order, <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span>
    being the lowest rank, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    the second highest rank, and Legend the highest rank.

    <p>Each rank has a certain number of “stars” that one needs to
    gain before advancing to the next rank. If a player wins a
    game, she gains a star. If before the game the player was on
    rank <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>-<span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span>, and this was the third or more
    consecutive win, she gains an additional bonus star for that
    win. When she has all the stars for her rank (see list below)
    and gains another star, she will instead gain one rank and have
    one star on the new rank.</p>
<p>For instance, if before a winning game the player had all
    the stars on her current rank, she will after the game have
    gained one rank and have <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> stars (depending on whether she
    got a bonus star) on the new rank. If on the other hand she had
    all stars except one on a rank, and won a game that also gave
    her a bonus star, she would gain one rank and have <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> star on the new rank.</p>
<p>If a player on rank <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-<span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> loses a game, she loses a star.
    If a player has zero stars on a rank and loses a star, she will
    lose a rank and have all stars minus one on the rank below.
    However, one can never drop below rank <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> (losing a game at rank
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> with no stars will
    have no effect).</p>
<p>If a player reaches the Legend rank, she will stay legend no
    matter how many losses she incurs afterwards.</p>
<p>The number of stars on each rank are as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Rank <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span>-<span class="tex2jax_process">$21$</span>: <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> stars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rank <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>-<span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span>: <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> stars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rank <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span>-<span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>: <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> stars</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rank <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>-<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>: <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> stars</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A player starts at rank <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> with no stars. Given the match
    history of a player, what is her rank at the end of the
    sequence of matches?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line describing the sequence
    of matches. Each character corresponds to one game; ‘<tt class="ttfamily">W</tt>’ represents a win and ‘<tt class="ttfamily">L</tt>’ a loss. The length of the line is between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span> characters (inclusive).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing a rank after having played
    the given sequence of games; either an integer between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> or “<tt class="ttfamily">Legend</tt>”.</p>
