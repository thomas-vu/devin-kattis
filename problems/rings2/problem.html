<p>Dee Siduous is a botanist who specializes in trees. A lot of
    her research has to do with the formation of tree rings, and
    what they say about the growing conditions over the tree’s
    lifetime. She has a certain theory and wants to run some
    simulations to see if it holds up to the evidence gathered in
    the field.</p>
<p>One thing that needs to be done is to determine the expected
    number of rings given the outline of a tree. Dee has decided to
    model a cross section of a tree on a two dimenional grid, with
    the interior of the tree represented by a closed polygon of
    grid squares. Given this set of squares, she assigns rings from
    the outer parts of the tree to the inner as follows: calling
    the non-tree grid squares “ring <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>”, each ring <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is made up of all those grid
    squares that have at least one ring <span class="tex2jax_process">$(n-1)$</span> square as a neighbor (where
    neighboring squares are those that share an edge).</p>
<p>An example of this is shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>Most of Dee’s models have been drawn on graph paper, and she
    has come to you to write a program to do this automatically for
    her. This way she’ll use less paper and save some <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span> well, you know.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will start with a line containing two positive
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> specifying the number of rows and
    columns in the tree grid, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n, m \leq 100$</span>. After this will be
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> rows containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> characters each. These
    characters will be either ‘T’ indicating a tree grid square, or
    ‘.’.<br/></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a grid with the ring numbers. If the number of rings
    is less than 10, use two characters for each grid square;
    otherwise use three characters for each grid square. Right
    justify all ring numbers in the grid squares, and use ‘.’ to
    fill in the remaining characters.</p>
<p>If a row or column does not contain a ring number it should
    still be output, filled entirely with ‘.’s.</p>
