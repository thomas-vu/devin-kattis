<p>The people of Absurdistan discovered how to build roads only
    last year. After the discovery, each city decided to build its
    own road, connecting the city with some other city. Each newly
    built road can be used in both directions.</p>
<p>Absurdistan is full of absurd coincidences. It took all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> cities precisely one
    year to build their roads. And even more surprisingly, when the
    roads were finished it was possible to travel from every city
    to any other city using the newly built roads. We say that such
    a road network is <em>connected</em>. Being interested in
    mathematics and probability, you started wondering how unlikely
    this coincidence really is.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Each city picked uniformly at random another city to which
    they built a road. Calculate the probability that the road
    network ends up being connected.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2\le N\le 140)$</span> â€“ the number of
    cities.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing a floating point number denoting
    the probability that the randomly built road network with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> cities and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> roads is connected.
    Your answer should have an absolute error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-8}$</span>.</p>
