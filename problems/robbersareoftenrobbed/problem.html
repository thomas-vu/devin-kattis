<div class="problembody">
<p>Mario finds himself in a wealthy neighborhood. There are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> homes on a street each
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ i$</span> stars where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i \in [1, N]$</span>. He is
    given <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> burlap sacks
    with an infinite capacity to hold stolen stars. He can take as
    many or as few stars as he’d like from each house. However, a
    star from one home does not get along with a star from another
    home. As a result, stars from different homes can’t be placed
    in the same knapsack. However, Mario can split the stars from
    the one house across multiple sacks. Mario can also leave a
    sack empty if he deems it necessary.</p>
<p>Once Mario has completed his robbery, he will encounter
    Bowser who will steal exactly half of his knapsacks. Bowser
    will of course steal the sacks with the most stars. Knowing
    this, Mario has two objectives. His first priority is to
    maximize the amount of stars that he has at the end. After
    maximizing this value <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>,
    his second priority is to ensure that Bowser steals the minimum
    amount of stars across all possible robbing outcomes that leave
    Mario with <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> stars.</p>
<p>For example, in the first sample case, Mario can steal
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> stars from the houses
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, while stealing <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> stars from house <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>. Bowser will steal the largest two
    sacks giving him <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>
    stars while Mario will keep <span class="tex2jax_process">$19$</span> of the stars. Note that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$19$</span> stars is the largest
    amount of stars that Mario could have possibly acquired, while
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> is the minimum amount
    of stars that Bowser will steal across all outcomes where Mario
    gets <span class="tex2jax_process">$19$</span> stars.</p>
<p>However, in the second sample case, Mario will split the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> stars from house
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> across three of his
    knapsacks evenly, and then steal <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> of the stars from house
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> in his fourth
    knapsack. Bowser will steal <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> of these stars, leaving Mario
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> stars as
    well.</p>
<p>Output two numbers representing the maximum stars Mario can
    rob and the minimum number of stars he must give Bowser.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two space-separated integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq N,K \leq 1\, 000)$</span> . It is guaranteed that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> is even.<br/>
    The next line will contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0 \leq S_ i \leq 1\, 000)$</span>, each
    representing the number of stars at each house.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing two numbers representing the
    maximum stars Mario can rob and the minimum number of stars he
    must give Bowser in that order.</p>
