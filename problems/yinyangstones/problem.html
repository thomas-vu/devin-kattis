<p>A mysterious circular arrangement of black stones and white
    stones has appeared. Ming has been tasked with balancing the
    stones so that only one black and one white stone remain.</p>
<p>Ming has two operations for balancing the stones:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Take some consecutive sequence of stones where there is
        exactly one more black stone than a white stone and replace
        the stones with a single black stone</p>
</li>

<p>Take some consecutive sequence of stones where there is
        exactly one more white stone than black stone and replace
        the stones with a single white stone</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Given a circular arrangement, determine if it is possible
    for Ming to balance the stones.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that
    your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The
    input will consist of a single string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le |s| \le 10^5$</span>), with only the characters capital ‘B’
    and ‘W’. The stones are arranged in a circle, so the first
    stone and the last stone are adjacent.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> if it is
    possible for Ming to balance the stones with his rules.
    Otherwise, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
