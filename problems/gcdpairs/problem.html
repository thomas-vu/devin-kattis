<div class="problembody">
<p>In the Shape Galaxy, where all shapes are sentient beings,
    there is currently a feud between circles and squares. Circles
    want all pathways to be flat while squares argue that they
    should be evenly spaced inverted catenary shaped bumps. Because
    of this feud, circles have begun to dislike all square-biased
    numbers. A number <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is
    square-biased if it is divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$x^2$</span>, for some integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x &gt; 1$</span>.</p>
<p>Mr. Circle has taken this feud to heart. He is given the
    assignment of calculating the greatest common divisor between
    all pairs of numbers in an array. He wants to go one step
    further and count the number of greatest common divisors that
    are not square biased.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le n \le 10^5)$</span>, representing the
    length of the array of numbers.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    contain the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_i$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le a_i \le 10^{12})$</span>
    which comprise the numbers in the array.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the number of pairs <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i, j)$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le i &lt; j \le n)$</span> such that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\gcd (a_i, a_j)$</span> is not
    square-biased.</p>
