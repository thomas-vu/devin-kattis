<div class="problembody">
<p>Taking attendance in your class is a tedious task. You call
    out the names of students one at a time in alphabetical order.
    If the student is present, they respond by saying “<tt class="ttfamily">Present!</tt>” before you call the next name.</p>
<p>This is such a boring task that you sometimes zone out and
    don’t keep a proper record of attendance. Write a program to
    help you summarize the absences!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq N \leq 200)$</span> indicating the
    number of “callouts”. Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines follow indicating the
    callouts that were made in the order they were made. A single
    line consists of either a student’s name or of the response
    <tt class="ttfamily">Present!</tt>. A student’s name will
    consist of between <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> characters, the first
    always being an uppercase letter (<tt class="ttfamily">’A’</tt>-<tt class="ttfamily">’Z’</tt>) and the
    remaining characters always being lowercase letters (<tt class="ttfamily">’a’</tt>-<tt class="ttfamily">’z’</tt>).</p>
<p>The student names will appear in alphabetical order in this
    input and a line with the response <tt class="ttfamily">Present!</tt> will only appear if the previous line
    was the name of a student. In particular, the response
    <tt class="ttfamily">Present!</tt> will never appear as the
    first callout.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the names of all students that are absent in the
    order they were called, each on a separate line. If no students
    were absent, simply output the message <tt class="ttfamily">No
    Absences</tt></p>
