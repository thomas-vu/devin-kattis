<div class="problembody">
<p>Your GPS has been directing you to an unknown destination
    for the past several hours. You are curious about where it will
    take you to, and how long the remaining drive will be. You try
    to look at the display of your GPS to find out.</p>
<p>The screen of your GPS can be modeled as an <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> grid. Each cell represents an
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> meter by <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> meter square of actual space,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is a power of
    10. Each cell can display the following characters:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">@</tt> indicates your current
        location is on the center of this square.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">$</tt> indicates that your
        destination is on the center of this square.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">#</tt> is a cell that is not on
        your current path.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">.</tt> is a cell that is on your
        current path. We call these cells, as well as the start and
        end locations, <em>path cells</em>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any lowercase Latin character is part of a label. The
        cell the character is on is not on your current path.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You wish to find the total remaining distance until your
    destination arrives. Formally, let <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_1, P_2, \cdots , P_ k$</span> be some
    sequence of cells on the GPS such that</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$P_1$</span> is your
        starting cell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ k$</span> is your
        ending cell.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span> is a path
        cell, for every <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 &lt; i
        &lt; k$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$P_{i-1}$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span> are adjacent,
        for every <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 &lt; i &lt;
        k$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ j$</span> are
        <em>not</em> adjacent, for every <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i, j \leq k$</span> such that
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i + 1 &lt; j$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All cells that are not equal to some <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span> are not path cells.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is guaranteed that such a sequence of cells exists.</p>
<p>The <em>length</em> of the route represented by the GPS is
    the length of the shortest path that passes through the centers
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_1, P_2, \dots , P_
    k$</span>, in that order. Find the length of your route.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq h, w \leq 580$</span>), the
    dimensions of your GPS’s display, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$10
    \leq s \leq 10^{18}$</span>), the scale of the GPS’s
    display.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> lines
    each contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>
    characters, which are each one of the characters mentioned
    above. It is guaranteed that there will be exactly one
    <tt class="ttfamily">@</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">#</tt> in
    this grid.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>On a single line, output “<tt class="ttfamily">Your
    destination will arrive in x meters</tt>” (without quotes),
    where “<tt class="ttfamily">x</tt>” is replaced by the actual
    length of the path.</p>
