<p>Pero is a passionate lover of riddles. The newest type of
    riddles he has come across requires the solver to check whether
    the given word is a multigram.</p>
<p>A multigram is a word that consists of concatenating two or
    more words that are all mutually anagrams. The first of these
    words is called the root of the multigram. For instance, the
    word <tt class="ttfamily">bbabab</tt> is a multigram with the
    root <tt class="ttfamily">bba</tt> because it consists of
    anagrams <tt class="ttfamily">bba</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">bab</tt>.</p>
<p>Help Pero solve the riddle by determining whether his word
    is a multigram and determining its root in case it is. If there
    are multiple possible roots of the multigram, output the
    shortest.</p>
<p>Note: Two words are mutually anagrams if one of them can be
    obtained from the other by changing the letter order.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains a word of length
    at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>
    lowercase English characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the given word is not a multigram, output <tt class="ttfamily">-1</tt>. Otherwise, output the shortest root of the
    given word in one line.</p>
