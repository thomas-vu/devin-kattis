<p>The army wants to put up a new base in dangerous territory.
    The base will be surrounded by a citadel consisting of a number
    of straight walls. At every corner where two walls meet, there
    will be a watchtower. In order to enable efficient coordination
    in case of attack, the number of watchtowers should not exceed
    four.</p>

<p>After a detailed survey of the area, the army has concluded
    that not all locations are equally suitable for a watchtower:
    the ground needs to be firm enough to support the weight of the
    tower, and there should be enough visibility. They have
    selected a number of locations that meet the requirements.</p>
<p>Within these constraints, the army would like to build a
    base that is as large as possible. For this, they have come to
    you for help. Since the results of the survey are of course
    classified, you will not be given the possible locations
    directly; rather, you should write a program that can take them
    as input. Furthermore, they want the program to be able to
    handle multiple test cases in one go, so that they can hide the
    real data among lots of fake data.</p>
<p>For the computation of the area, you may assume that the
    watchtowers are infinitesimal in size and the walls
    infinitesimal in width.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$ 3 \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span>): the
        number of locations that are suitable for a watchtower.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        with two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\, 000 \leq x,y \leq 10\,
        000$</span>): the coordinates of each location.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All locations are distinct.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a single number: the largest possible area
        that the base can have. This number will be either an
        integer or a half-integer. If it is an integer, print that
        integer; if it is a half-integer, print the integer part
        followed by “<tt>.5</tt>”. Trailing zeros are not
        allowed.</p>
</li>
