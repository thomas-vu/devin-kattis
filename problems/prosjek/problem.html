<div class="problembody">
<p>Slavko decided to challenge Mirko! He gave him a real number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> and a bag full of
    pieces of paper with exactly one number between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> inclusive written on each paper.
    There is an unlimited quantity of each type of paper.</p>
<p>Mirko’s task is to pick the minimum number of papers in a
    way that the average of the numbers written on them equals
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>First and only line of input contains real number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> will have between 1 and 9 decimal
    places, inclusive <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq P \leq
    5)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>First and only line of output should contain five
    nonnegative integers – numbers of ones, twos, threes, fours and
    fives used, respectively. If there are multiple solutions,
    output any one of them.</p>
