<p>Together with your coworker, Larry, you are organizing the
    exciting Billiards and Pool Competition for your coworkers in
    your small company. You and Larry are usually on the same page,
    and surely he will approve of your latest idea. You even bought
    a nice prize for your coworkers to win and you hope that they
    are as excited as you are. You want to maximise fun.</p>
<p>It would thus be nice to try to avoid complete walkovers:
    that is no fun for either player. After some thought, you think
    it is good to suggest to Larry to divide the players into
    groups of two. That way, you can compensate for a player’s
    strength by pairing them with a weaker player. In fact, it
    would be perfect if every team had the exact same strength!
    Before you tell Larry your plans, you decide to first figure
    out whether this is possible.</p>
<p>According to your model, synergy plays a negligible role in
    determining team strength, and the strength of a team is simply
    determined by the strength of its individual members. Every
    coworker has a certain skill level in both billiards and pool,
    as indicated by two nonnegative integers. When two coworkers
    are teamed up, their total skill is the sum of their individual
    skills. Can you divide everyone into teams of two such that
    every team has the exact same skill in both pool and
    billiards?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>A line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq n\leq 10^5$</span>), the number of
        coworkers you have.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        lines containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^6\leq b, p \leq 10^6$</span>), the
        skill in billiards and pool, respectively, of each
        coworker.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “<tt class="ttfamily">possible</tt>” if it is
    possible to divide all coworkers into teams of two with equal
    skill. Output “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”
    otherwise.</p>
