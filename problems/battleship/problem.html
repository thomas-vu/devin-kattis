<p>When playing battleship, players take turns trying to sink
    the other players navy. Each player may take shots at one
    coordinate at once. If he hits one of his enemy’s ships and the
    enemy has any other ships left, he may continue. Else, the
    other player may take shots. After hitting a ship at one
    coordinate, shooting at that coordinate again counts as a
    miss.</p>
<p>The game is finished when every part of every ship of a navy
    of one player has been hit. The first player starts, and every
    player gets the same number of turns. That means, that the
    second player might get another turn even if all his ships have
    been sunk.</p>
<p>The game ends with a draw if both navies are completely
    sunk, or if there are still ships left after all shots have
    been fired.<br/></p>
<p>Tom the little spy watches a game of battleships between two
    fleet admirals. As he has successfully tapped the communication
    wires, he can intercept the shot orders. However, he was unable
    to determine which admiral ordered what shot to be fired.</p>
<p>After the game, he successfully breaks into the super secret
    game management facility, and manages to secure the fleet
    deployment maps. As he wants to determine which fleet admiral
    is more dangerous, he wants to know which admiral won.</p>
<p>He transmits the deployment maps and the shot orders, and
    wants you to determine which admiral won.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with one line, containing the number of test
    cases <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; t \le 20$</span>).</p>
<p>Every test case starts with a line, containing three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le w, h \leq 30; 1 \le n \leq 2000$</span>), describing the
    width and height of the fleet deployment maps, and the number
    of shots.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> lines
    contain the deployment map for player one. Each line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> field descriptions,
    where ’<tt class="tt">_</tt>’ means “water” and ’<tt class="tt">#</tt>’ means “ship”. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> lines containing the deployment
    map for player two.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    contain the shot orders; each order consists of two integers,
    the x and y coordinate of the shot. The x coordinate indicates
    the column of the shot, running from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$w-1$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> meaning the leftmost column. The y
    coordinate indicates the line of the shot, running from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$h-1$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> meaning the last line, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h-1$</span> meaning the first
    line of the respective map.</p>
<p>Please note that there may be more shot orders than needed
    to end the game.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For every test case, print one of “<tt class="tt">player one
    wins</tt>”, “<tt class="tt">player two wins</tt>” or
    “<tt class="tt">draw</tt>”, on a line.</p>
