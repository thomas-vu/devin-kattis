<div class="problembody">
<p>Welcome to the world of <em>Heroes of Velmar</em>, the
    critically acclaimed trading card game developed by <em>Sidney
    Games</em>! After the tremendous success of the physical card
    game, Sidney Games has decided to take it to the next level and
    transform it into an immersive video game experience.</p>
<p>As Sidney Games embarks on this ambitious video game
    project, they seek the expertise of talented developers like
    you to bring this digital version to life. The challenge lies
    in coding the algorithm that determines the winner in the
    virtual battles that unfold between players. The video game
    will need to retain the same core mechanics as the original
    card game, where players compete on three distinct locations
    over six turns, with abilities and power levels shaping the
    outcomes.</p>
<p>The full rules of the game are listed below. You are given
    the state of the locations after <em>Setup</em> and
    <em>Gameplay</em> have finished and the <em>End of the
    Game</em> has been reached. Sidney Games has tasked you with
    implementing the <em>Location Resolution</em> part of the game
    rules, including the application of <em>Special Abilities</em>,
    to determine the winner.</p>
<p>The game designers have provided you with images of the
    cards as well as a JSON file with their specifications.</p>
<h2>Heroes of Velmar - Game Rules</h2>
<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>The objective of the two-player card game <em>Heroes of
    Velmar</em> is to win more locations than the opponent over six
    turns. If there is a tie, the total power level across all
    locations acts as a tiebreaker.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Each player selects a deck of cards containing heroes
        with different abilities and power levels.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The players shuffle their decks and draw a starting hand
        of 7 cards each.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Designate three distinct locations for the battle. Each
        location will have its own separate battlefield.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Each player draws 1 card from the deck, to their hand,
        if possible. Maximum cards per hand is 7.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players take turns playing cards from their hand on any
        of the three locations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On each turn, players have energy equal to the turn
        number, for example, on Turn 3, they have 3 energy to
        spend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each card has a cost that must be paid using energy to
        play it on a location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players can play as many cards as they want as long as
        the following conditions are met:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>They have sufficient energy to spend on the
            card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The location has an empty spot. Each player has 4
            available spots per location.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
<p>The power level of each card represents its strength in
        the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the turn ends, the energy not used is lost.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>End of the Game</h3>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>The game ends after six turns, at which point locations
        are resolved, with each location having a winner or a
        tie.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The player who wins the most locations is the overall
        winner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the players win an equal number of locations, the
        total power level across all locations is used as a
        tiebreaker to determine the winner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the total power level across all locations is also
        tied, then the game results in a tie.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Location Resolution</h3>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Locations are resolved separately at the end of the
        game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare the total power levels of all cards played by
        each player at the location after applying special
        abilities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The player with the higher total power level wins the
        location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is a tie, no one wins the location.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Special Abilities</h3>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Some cards have special abilities that can affect the
        game. These abilities trigger at the end of the game,
        before location resolution.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abilities can buff the card’s power level, interact with
        other cards, or manipulate the game state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two cards that portray the same character are considered
        to portray distinct characters for the sake of
        abilities.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The game <em>Heroes of Velmar</em> offers a mix of strategic
    card play, resource management, and tactical decision-making.
    Players must choose their heroes wisely, coordinate their
    plays, and employ their unique abilities to outwit their
    opponents and emerge victorious in the epic battle for control
    over Velmar!</p>
