<p>The French gourmet Frank is a very well-respected gourmet;
    his job involves going around to various restaurants, eating
    their food and then writing a review about the restaurant. But
    he carries a dark secret: he is actually only interested in
    eating as much as possible and in any order!</p>
<p>However, Frank understands that a true gourmet canâ€™t eat in
    just any manner, like starting with his dessert and finishing
    with a salad. Therefore, he asks for your help in constructing
    a list with all the different ways he could arrange his courses
    during a meal, so that he can pick the best order.</p>
<p>During the serving, Frank has <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> minutes to eat. The restaurant
    offers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> different
    courses, and he can eat any number of servings of each course.
    For course <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, it takes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ i$</span> minutes to eat a
    serving of it. Frank wants to eat something during each of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> minutes he has, and he
    wants to finish every course that he is served. He never wants
    to start eating a new course until he finished the last
    one.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a program to compute the number of
    ways he could arrange his meal, given these restrictions.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le M \le 1\, 000$</span>), the number of minutes.</p>
<p>The second line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 30$</span>), the number of courses.</p>
<p>Afterwards, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    follow with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_
    i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le T_ i \le
    200$</span>) on each line, the time it takes to eat every
    dish.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The program should output the number of ways in which Frank
    can eat during exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    minutes.</p>
<p>The answer will always be at most 2 billion (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000\, 000\, 000$</span>).</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>Your solution will be tested on a set of test case groups.
    To get the points for a group, you need to pass all the test
    cases in the group.</p>

<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>Your program will be tested on <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> test cases. For each test cases
    you pass, you will get <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> points.</p>
<p>For test cases worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span> points, the answer will be less
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> million
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000\, 000$</span>).</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span></h2>
<p>Frank is going to eat during <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> minutes and have two courses to
    choose from, for example a salad (takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> minutes to eat) and pie
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> minutes). There are
    only two ways he can eat them: first pie and then salad or vice
    versa. If he only eats salad he will either finish too quickly
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \text { servings} = 9 \text {
    minutes}$</span>) or too late (<span class="tex2jax_process">$4
    \text { servings} = 12 \text { minutes}$</span>).</p>
