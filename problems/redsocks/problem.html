<div class="problembody">
<p>You have a drawer that is full of two kinds of socks: red
    and black. You know that there are at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> socks, and not more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$50\, 000$</span>. However, you
    do not know how many there actually are, nor do you know how
    many are red, or how many are black.</p>
<p>You have noticed, though, that when you reach into the
    drawer each morning and choose two socks to wear (in pitch
    darkness, so you cannot distinguish red from black), the
    probability that you pick two red socks is exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; q$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le p \le q$</span>.</p>
<p>From this, can you determine how many socks of each colour
    are in your drawer? There may be multiple solutions – if so,
    pick the solution with the fewest total number of socks, but
    still allowing you to wear a couple of same color socks.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of multiple problems, each on a separate
    line. Each problem consists of the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> separated by a single space. You
    may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> will both fit into an
    unsigned 32-bit integer.</p>
<p>Input is terminated by a line consisting of two zeroes.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each problem, output a single line consisting of the
    number of red socks and the number of black socks in your
    drawer, separated by one space. If there is no solution to the
    problem, print “impossible”.</p>
