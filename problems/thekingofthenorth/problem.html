<p>Winter is coming (or going? who can be sure these days) and
    a new king rises in the North. The message travels quickly
    these days... That is why you, the rising king, have not much
    time left. You need to rally your bannermen behind you. But one
    question seems harder to answer than you would have first
    expected. How large of a kingdom can you claim and how many men
    should you send for? Your advisors have taken a close look at
    the potential kingdom and have determined how many of your
    bannermen would be required to fully defend any part of the map
    against your foes. As you are a loving and caring king, you
    want to minimize the number of men that have to serve in your
    army. To give your war council a fair chance of figuring out
    the best kingdom to defend, you have to determine the size of
    the army that you will raise as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Luckily, armies are not that advanced yet. You will only
    have to defend against armies moving horizontally or vertically
    (an army cannot pass by your bannermen diagonally). Your
    kingdom counts as defended, if there is not a single way to
    reach your castle, starting anywhere outside of the map,
    without passing to a fully defended area. Squares on the map
    labeled <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> represent high
    mountains, or walls, no one would ever be foolish enough to
    climb. You can assume to be safe from invasion without sending
    any bannermen to defend them. Since you are uncertain about
    what lurks behind the wall (or in our case the borders of the
    map), you have to assume the worst and plan as if you would
    never be able to hold any position outside of the given
    map.</p>

          by your war council.

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is given in the form of the (rectangular)
    strategic map which your advisors came up with. Every square in
    the map is assigned a number of bannermen which would be
    required to defend the position against any potential army. The
    map is formatted as follows: In the first line you are given
    two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq R,C \leq 300$</span>, specifying the
    dimensions of the map. This line is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> lines, each containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq c_ i \leq 100\, 000$</span>, the
    number of bannermen necessary to defend each square. Finally,
    you are given <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; r &lt;
    R-1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; c &lt;
    C-1$</span>, the position of your own castle on the map.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output an integer on a single line, the smallest possible
    army you would require to defend the kingdom given in the
    input.</p>
