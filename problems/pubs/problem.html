<p>A bit over three years ago, you were elected president of
    the glorious and picturesque country of Molvanîa, a land
    untouched by modern dentistry. To secure your landslide victory
    in the election you had to make a few promises, some of which,
    with the clarity of hindsight, may have been a tad
    exaggerated.</p>
<p>Molvanîa’s economy is quite simple compared to that of most
    other countries. The two main professions in Molvanîa are
    pub-owners, and beer-drinkers. These two groups combined
    account for over 75% of the Molvanîan GDP (Gross Domestic
    Product). Slightly simplified, the system works like this: the
    beer-drinkers borrow money to pay for their beer. This creates
    income for the pub-owners. The pub-owners use their income to
    purchase AAA-rated bonds, backed by loans to beer-drinkers.
    This system is locally referred to as pub-prime lending.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>One of your election-time promises was to further optimize
    Molvanîa’s Tiger economy through improved city planning. You
    have identified a number of suitable construction sites in
    which either a pub or a house of a beer-drinker can be built.
    There are walkways between some of these sites. To fully
    optimize the economy, you want to place buildings such that
    each house has at least one pub at only a walkway’s distance,
    and each pub has at least one house at only a walkway’s
    distance. It might happen that this is impossible, but you will
    try your best.</p>
<p>Beware that the city has a quite peculiar lay-out, and it
    may not even be possible to draw it on a normal map. Molvanîa
    is special that way.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    construction sites and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    walkways in the city (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le n\le
    10\, 000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le m\le
    100\, 000$</span>). The first line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, separated by a single space. The
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines contain
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le x, y \le n)$</span> indicating that
    there is a walkway between <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>. There are no loops (i.e.,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x \neq y$</span>) and all lines
    with walkway descriptions are distinct.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is impossible to build pubs and houses such that every
    pub is next to a house and every house is next to a pub, print
    <tt class="tt">Impossible</tt> on a line. Otherwise output
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space separated words.
    Print <tt class="tt">pub</tt> or <tt class="tt">house</tt> for
    each construction site. The first word indicates what to build
    at construction site 1, the next at construction site 2, and so
    on. If there are multiple valid solutions, you can output any
    of them.</p>
