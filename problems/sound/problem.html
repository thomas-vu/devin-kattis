<p>In digital recording, sound is described by a sequence of
    numbers representing the air pressure, measured at a rapid rate
    with a fixed time interval between successive measurements.
    Each value in the sequence is called a <b class="bfseries">sample</b>.</p>
<p>An important step in many voice-processing tasks is breaking
    the recorded sound into chunks of non-silence separated by
    silence. To avoid accidentally breaking the recording into too
    few or too many pieces, the silence is often defined as a
    sequence of m samples where the difference between the lowest
    and the highest value does not exceed a certain treshold
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>.</p>
<p>Write a program to detect silence in a given recording of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> samples according to
    the given parameter values <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains three integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1\, 000\, 000$</span>), the
    number of samples in the recording; <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le m \le 10\, 000$</span>), the required length of the
    silence; and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le c \le 10\, 000$</span>),
    the maximal noise level allowed within silence. The second line
    of the input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a[i]$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le a[i] \le 1\, 000\,
    000$</span> for <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i \le
    n$</span>), separated by single spaces: the samples in the
    recording.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>You should output a list of all values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$\max (a[i \dots i + m - 1]) - min(a[i \dots
    i + m - 1]) \le c$</span> (where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a[i \dots j]$</span> means the values
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a[i], a[i + 1], \dots ,
    a[j]$</span>). The values should be listed in increasing order,
    each on a separate line. If there is no silence in the input,
    write <tt class="ttfamily">NONE</tt> on the first and only line
    of the output.</p>
