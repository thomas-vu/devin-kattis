<p>You aspire to become a top Minecraft survival speedrunner.
    So, you need to come up with a strategy to do every necessary
    task quickly and efficiently. After watching a lot of previous
    world record speedruns, you noticed that the first day is the
    most crucial.<br/></p>
<p>You need to finish at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> tasks on the first Minecraft day
    for the speedrun to succeed. Each Minecraft day is <span class="tex2jax_process">$24\, 000$</span> ticks long, and thus to be
    a true gamer, you decided to do your math in Minecraft lingo.
    You can only work on one task at a time, and you cannot start
    another task before finishing your current task. Each task can
    only be done in a specific period of time <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq t_{start} &lt; t_{end} \leq 24\,
    000$</span>. Note: so long as the starting time of a task is
    greater than or equal to the end time of the previous task, the
    task can be scheduled with no conflict.<br/></p>
<p>Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span>, the minimum
    number of tasks you need to do on the first Minecraft day;
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of
    possible tasks you can do, and their corresponding time period,
    determine whether this run can be successful.<br/></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> space-separated integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; G \leq N &lt;
    10^5$</span>, the number of tasks you need to do on the first
    day and the total number of tasks. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each consist of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_{start}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_{end}$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq t_{start} &lt; t_{end} \leq 24\,
    000$</span>.<br/></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “<tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt>” if the run can be
    potentially successful, and “<tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt>”
    otherwise.<br/></p>
