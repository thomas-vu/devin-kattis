<div class="problembody">
<p>In a chess competition, every player plays one game against
    every other player. The winner receives one point, the loser
    none. In case of a draw, both players receive half a point.
    When all games have been played, whoever scored the most points
    wins the competition. If multiple competitors are tied for the
    highest score, they will play a series of tie-break games to
    determine the winner.</p>
<p>For this problem we consider a competition where the games
    are played in arbitrary order. Based on the outcome of the
    games that have been played so far (which could be all, or
    none, or anything in between) the organizers want to determine
    which players can still win the competition.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 30$</span>): the number of
        players.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines with
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> characters each,
        describing the intermediate results. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th character on the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line gives the
        result of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
        player against the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th player:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>’<tt>1</tt>’ for a win,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>’<tt>0</tt>’ for a loss,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>’<tt>d</tt>’ for a draw,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>’<tt>.</tt>’ if this game has not been played
            yet,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>’<tt>x</tt>’ when <span class="tex2jax_process">$i =
            j$</span> (since competitors do not play against
            themselves).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The intermediate results are guaranteed to be internally
    consistent. More formally, if the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th character on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line is a digit (’<tt>0</tt>’
    or ’<tt>1</tt>’) then the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th character on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th line will be the other digit.
    In all other cases, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th character on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line equals the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th character on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th line.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-based indices of all the
        players that can possibly win the competition, in
        increasing order, separated by spaces.</p>
</li>
