<p>The Call for Problems for the ICPC North America Qualifier
    (NAQ) has finished, and a number of problems were proposed. The
    judges voted on the difficulty of each problem. The NAQ does
    not want to be considered an odd contest, so therefore they
    refuse to use any problem which has an odd number (not
    divisible by two) for a difficulty rating.</p>
<p>Given the difficulty ratings of the candidate problems, how
    many were excluded by this rule?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 50$</span>), which is the number
    of candidate problems.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le d \le 100$</span>), which are the difficulty ratings of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> problems.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the number of candidate
    problems excluded by the rule.</p>
