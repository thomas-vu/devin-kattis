<div class="problembody">
<p>You are tasked with creating a secret sequence of integers
    that is difficult to guess.</p>
<p>The sequence is subject to the following constraints:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first number in the sequence must be <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last number in the sequence must be <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each number in the sequence must be either <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> greater than the one preceding
        it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At first, all you need to reveal is the length of the
    sequence.</p>
<p>Then, an adversary will guess the numbers in the sequence
    one at a time.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If the guessed number is in your sequence, you must
        reveal exactly where in the sequence it appears.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the guessed number is not in your sequence, you must
        simply reveal that it is not in the sequence. This is
        considered a “miss”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that because you are not forced to write down the
    sequence in advance, you can “cheat” by changing the sequence
    you have in mind, so long as it does not contradict the
    information you have revealed so far. It turns out that under
    these conditions, you can always force the adversary to get
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$33\, 333$</span> misses before
    they can guess every number in your sequence. Your job is to
    write a program that does so.</p>
<h2>Interaction</h2>
<p>This is an interactive problem.</p>
<p>Your program should begin by printing <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2
    \leq k \leq 100\, 001)$</span>, the length of your sequence, as
    a single integer on a single line. After this, you will receive
    one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> on a
    single line. This integer is guaranteed to be between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> inclusive.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = -1$</span>, the
        adversary has given up; your program should print all
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> integers in your
        sequence in order, one line per integer, and then exit. The
        adversary is guaranteed to give this input after it has
        gotten <span class="tex2jax_process">$33\, 333$</span>
        misses, though it may do so earlier. After printing all
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> integers, your
        program should exit. If you print a valid sequence
        consistent with your previous responses, your submission
        will be considered correct for this test case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is not in
        your sequence, print <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> on a single line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is in your
        sequence, print a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> on a single line, such that
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th (1-indexed)
        number in the sequence. If you have printed every integer
        from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, your program
        should now exit, and your submission will receive a Wrong
        Answer verdict.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not forget to flush the output after every integer you
    print.</p>
<p>After this, if your program has not yet exited, the process
    will repeat, with you receiving another single integer. The
    adversary is guaranteed to never repeat integers.</p>
<p>The adversary may employ different guessing strategies on
    different runs.</p>
