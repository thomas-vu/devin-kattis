<p>Everybody is into cloud computing these days, so quite a few
    different business models are being experimented with. You are
    trying a very simple one: you sell time on your machines in one
    of two batches called <em>slots</em>. A customer can buy one
    second of CPU time or <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>
    seconds for some integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>.</p>
<p>Each time slot a customer purchases must be completed on a
    single machine, but you get to decide how to allocate the
    purchased time slots between machines.</p>
<p>After coming back from a long vacation, you see that all of
    your machines are idle and a variety of orders have come in. To
    keep customers happy, you must decide how to distribute these
    requests between machines in a way that minimizes the time when
    the purchased time slots are finally all completed.</p>
<p>What is the smallest amount of time in which you can
    complete all of the purchased time slots?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing four integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq Q \leq 1\, 000$</span>), which is the
    time needed to complete the longer batches, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq 1\, 000\, 000$</span>), which
    is the number of machines owned by your company, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq S \leq 1\, 000\, 000$</span>), which
    is the number of 1-second time slots purchased, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq L \leq 1\, 000\, 000$</span>), which
    is the number of <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>-second time slots purchased.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the smallest amount of time in which you can
    complete all of the purchased time slots.</p>
