<p>You are a member of the “Cohort of Cheating and Sneaky
    Students at UCLA” or “CS Students” for short. Your goal? In
    every exam, you want to cheat in the most efficient way
    possible. The Leader of your cohort is somehow able to acquire
    the answers to all the questions five minutes before the exam
    (it is unclear how the leader manages to do so but the members
    suspect some insider TA play at hand). Thus, the cohort needs a
    way to somehow share the answers DURING the exam!</p>
<p>The cohort’s cheating strategy is simple. One of the members
    of the cohort gets up from their seat and sneakily walks toward
    another member of the cohort to share all the answers they
    know. Once a student learns of an answer, they remember it
    forever and can share it with the next student. There are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> students represented
    as points in the plane and you may assume the shortest distance
    between any two students <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i,
    y_ i)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ j, y_
    j)$</span> is their manhattan distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$|x_ i - x_ j| + |y_ i - y_ j|$</span>. Every
    student takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> seconds
    to travel a distance of <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>. After sharing answers with
    another student, the student then returns to their seat
    (students may inform only one student before returning to their
    seat). To avoid the professor’s gaze, before a student gets up,
    anyone from the cohort asks a question which the professor
    turns around and clarifies on the whiteboard so you needn’t
    worry about the student getting caught. But you must be
    careful! Only one student may get up at a time and must return
    directly to their seat else the professor will find out, and
    you will sadly be dubbed the “Cohort of Colossally Stupid
    Students at UCLA”.</p>
<p>The professor has already fixed the seating layout before
    the exam and shared it with the class. Given this seating
    layout as a list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    points <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i, y_ i)$</span> in
    the plane, can you help everyone in the cohort get all the
    answers as quickly as possible to ensure everyone finishes on
    time?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of students in the
    cohort taking the exam. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contain two space-separated
    integers each <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span> denoting the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> student’s
    position in the examination hall. (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 2\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1\, 000 \leq x_ i,\ y_ i \leq 1\,
    000$</span>)</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing a single integer, the
    minimum amount of time (in seconds) required to ensure everyone
    gets all the answers to the exam.</p>
