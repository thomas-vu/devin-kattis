<div class="problembody">
<p>A group of friends has just completed their CS assignments,
    and because of the nice weather, they decide to go to Joe’s
    house for a BBQ. Unfortunately, after all that coding, they are
    too tired to walk. Fortunately, between them they have enough
    cars to take everyone.</p>
<p>Joe remembers that he needs to stop off at the supermarket
    along the way to buy some burgers and pop.</p>
<p>Jenn proposes that they stop at her house to get a
    frisbee.</p>
<p>Jim decides that he doesn’t like burgers, and wants to grab
    a pizza along the way.</p>
<p>After having spent so long in the computer lab, Jerry’s eyes
    have become very sensitive to sunlight, so he needs to stop at
    his house for his sunglasses.</p>
<p>And so it goes: each person needs to run a little errand
    along the way. At this rate, the friends worry that it will be
    dark by the time they get to Joe’s house. They launch into a
    heated discussion to about who should go in which car to
    minimize the time needed for everyone to reach Joe’s house. The
    discussion itself, of course, wastes precious time that could
    be better spent at the BBQ.</p>
<p>To help the group, you will write a program to settle the
    discussion by computing an optimal assignment of people to
    cars. The overall travel time is the maximum of the travel
    times of each car. An optimal assignment is one that minimizes
    the overall travel time.</p>
<p>Your program will be provided with a representation of the
    roads in the city, in the form of distances between major
    landmarks. Assume that every car always travels at 60
    kilometres per hour (one kilometre per minute). Each stop (at a
    supermarket, someone’s house, etc.) takes five minutes.</p>
<p>Although the friends have many cars between them, to be nice
    to the environment, they decide to take no more cars than
    necessary. Each car can take at most five people.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 15$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m
    \le 1\, 000$</span>, the number of people in the group and the
    number of roads in the city. The places that must be visited
    along the way are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. The campus is numbered
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, and Joe’s house is
    numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$n+1$</span>. An
    additional <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
    follow, each containing three integers describing a stretch of
    road. The first two integers are in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n+1$</span> inclusive, and describe the two
    places connected by the stretch of road. The third integer
    specifies the length of the stretch of road, in kilometres, and
    is a mumber between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>. A road
    may be taken in both directions. There is a sequence of roads
    connecting every place in the city to every other place.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, giving the number of minutes
    required for everyone to reach Joe’s house using an optimal
    assignment of people to cars.</p>
