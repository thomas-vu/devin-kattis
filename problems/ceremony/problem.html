<p>For the grand opening of the algorithmic games in
    NlogNsglow, a row of tower blocks is set to be demolished in a
    grand demonstration of renewal. Originally the plan was to
    accomplish this with controlled explosions, one for each tower
    block, but time constraints now require a hastier solution.</p>
<p>To help you remove the blocks more rapidly you have been
    given the use of a Universal Kinetic / Incandescent Energy
    Particle Cannon (UKIEPC). On a single charge, this cutting-edge
    contraption can remove either all of the floors in a single
    tower block, or all the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-th floors in all the blocks
    simultaneously, for userâ€™s choice of the floor number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>. In the latter case,
    the blocks that are less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> floors high are left untouched,
    while for blocks having more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> floors, all the floors above the
    removed <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-th one fall
    down by one level.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Given the number of floors of all towers, output the minimum
    number of charges needed to eliminate all floors of all
    blocks.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the number of blocks
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 100\, 000$</span>. The second
    line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    consecutive block heights <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_
    i$</span> for <span class="tex2jax_process">$i=1,2,\ldots
    ,n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq h_ i
    \leq 1\, 000\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing one integer: the minimum number
    of charges needed to tear down all the blocks.</p>
