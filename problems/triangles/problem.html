<p>You got a very strange gift for your birthday: two triangles
    in the three-dimensional space. Each triangle consists of three
    infinitely thin segments, and each segment stays straight no
    matter how hard you press it. Now, you actually wanted to get
    just one triangle, so you try to move the triangles far apart
    from each other, possibly after rotating one or both of them,
    so that you can throw away one of them. Is it possible? Or are
    they tangled?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several lines. The first line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le T\le 1000$</span>, the
    number of test cases. Each test case consists of two lines. The
    first line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1,y_1,z_1,x_2,y_2,z_2,x_3,y_3,z_3 \in
    [-1000,1000]$</span> denoting the vertices of the first
    triangle. The second line contains another <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x’_1,y’_1,z’_1,x’_2,y’_2,z’_2,x’_3,y’_3,z’_3
    \in [-1000,1000]$</span> denoting the vertices of the second
    triangle. Both triangles will be non-degenerate, which means
    that the corresponding triples of points will not be colinear.
    Moreover, it is guaranteed that no pair of segments from two
    different triangles intersects, and there is no common plane
    containing both triangles at once.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing YES if the
    triangles are tangled, and NO if it is possible to move them
    very far apart from each other.</p>
