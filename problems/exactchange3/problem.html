<div class="problembody">
<p>While in Binaria, you find a store where you want to buy
    some presents for your friends. In Binaria, the currency is
    bits, and the coin denominations are the set of all integer
    powers of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>. You know
    that you want to spend at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> bits here, but no more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> bits.</p>
<p>When you make a purchase, you must pay with exact change.
    You have an unlimited number of bits that you can access from
    your bank account, but you can choose to withdraw them in
    whatever denominations you find most convenient. Carrying many
    coins is inconvenient though, so you wish to minimize the
    number of coins you carry with you.</p>
<p>Compute the minimum number of coins you need to bring with
    you such that you can pay any integer amount of bits between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, inclusive.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a &lt; 2^{1000000}$</span>.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> will be written in
    base 2 with no leading zeros.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a \le b &lt; 2^{1000000}$</span>.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> will be written in
    base 2 with no leading zeros.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, the minimum number of coins you
    need to bring.</p>
