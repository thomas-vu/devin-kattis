<div class="problembody">
<p>You and your friends all work at different companies.
    However, not everyone may be satisfied with their current job.
    You therefore asked JobAgent to find out if there’s a job that
    fits you even better. After some computation, JobAgent came
    back with a list for which job is the best for each of you. The
    best thing is that each of you is already working at one of
    these jobs! As the good employees you are, you would never want
    to leave a job without a replacement, and never be unemployed
    at any time. The only reasonable solution is thus to repeatedly
    switch jobs with each other. How many times do two persons have
    to switch jobs with each other to get everyone to the job that
    JobAgent suggested?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le N \le 3\cdot 10^5$</span>), the number
    of friends (including yourself) to switch jobs.</p>
<p>This is followed by a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th of these contains the number of
    the person that currently has the job that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th person fits best for. Every
    person is numbered between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. It is guaranteed that for each
    job there is exactly one person that fits it best.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the smallest number of job switches
    that needs to be performed.</p>
<h2>Explanation of sample 2</h2>
<p>Nobody has the right job from the beginning. Three switches
    are sufficient for everyone to get the right job. Initially,
    the two first peoples can switch jobs, so that everyone has the
    jobs <tt class="ttfamily">3 2 4 1</tt> and person <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> gets the right job. Then, person
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> can switch jobs, resulting in the
    jobs <tt class="ttfamily">3 2 1 4</tt>. Lastly, only person
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> has the wrong jobs, and can switch
    with each other to finish the process.</p>
