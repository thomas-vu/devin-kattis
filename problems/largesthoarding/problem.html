<p>The real estate market in Metropolis is flourishing, and the
    main street in downtown Metropolis is now lined with a
    continuous row of high-rise buildings (skyscrapers). Not
    surprisingly, advertisers have been eager to put up large
    hoardings on the walls of these buildings. (For those
    unfamiliar with this use of “hoarding”, it is another word for
    “billboard” in many parts of the world.) After weighing the
    social and environmental impacts, the Metropolis city council
    decided to impose a ban on advertising hoardings along the main
    street. Following an intense legal battle, however, advertising
    agencies recently won a victory over the city’s hoardings ban
    when the high court declared the ban unconstitutional. The high
    court also recognized some of the merits of the ban, though,
    and ruled that hoardings may only be put up parallel to the
    main road, along the walls of the skyscrapers lining the road,
    and that hoardings must be rectangular in shape, and may not
    extend outside the skyline at any point.</p>
<p>As an account executive for a well-known advertising agency
    in Metropolis, you are excited by the high court’s decision.
    Recently, ABC Inc., a multinational retail corporation,
    hired your agency to design and install an advertisement
    hoarding for its new apparel business. In order to maximize its
    impact, ABC wants the size (surface area) of this hoarding to
    be as large as possible. You are handling ABC’s request, and
    hence you are busy calculating the largest possible billboard
    you can install, and therefore the largest amount of revenue
    your agency can collect from ABC each month. In Metropolis, the
    standard monthly cost of an advertisement hoarding is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\$ 50$</span> per square
    metre.</p>

<p>For example, suppose the Metropolis skyline appears as in
    Fig. 1(a), where the number at the top of each building
    specifies its height, and the number at the bottom of each
    building specifies its width (both quantities measured in
    metres). In this example, which corresponds to Sample
    Input 2, the largest legal hoarding (shown in
    Fig. 1(b)) spans the second, third, fourth, and fifth
    buildings, and has a height of <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span> metres, for a total surface area
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$60 \cdot 40= 2\, 400$</span>
    square metres, so ABC will have to pay your agency <span class="tex2jax_process">$\$ 50 \cdot 2\, 400 = \$ 120\, 000$</span>
    per month.</p>
<p>Given an arrangement of skyscrapers, your task is to report
    the monthly advertising revenue for the largest legal
    advertisement hoarding.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10\,
    000$</span>)</span>, the number of skyscrapers. This is
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    describing the skyscrapers in left-to-right order. Each of
    these lines contains two space-separated integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq H \leq
    100$</span>)</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq W \leq
    100$</span>)</span>, specifying the height and width,
    respectively, of one skyscraper. The skyscrapers in the skyline
    are “tight”, i.e., there is no gap between adjacent buildings.
    Special case: the absence of a building in the skyline is
    indicated by a line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$H =
    0$</span>; this represents an empty lot whose width is given by
    the corresponding <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>
    value.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a line containing a single integer, the monthly
    advertising revenue for the largest legal hoarding that can be
    installed on the building skyline specified in the input.</p>
