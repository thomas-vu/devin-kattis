<div class="description"></div>
</div>Bill the beekeeper has a problem! His bees like to fight
    with each other instead of producing honey. If the bees fight
    each other, then the honey turns out sour. The only way to stop
    the bees from fighting and keep the honey sweet is to ensure
    that the hives are not too close together. Help Bill figure out
    how many of this season’s hives will produce sour honey.

    <p>Bill’s hives all exist on a plane, and he knows some
    distance d such that two hives within <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> of each other will fight, and both
    will produce sour honey. If a hive does not fight with any
    other hives, it produces sweet honey. Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> and the positions of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> beehives, output how many hives
    will produce sweet honey and how many hives will produce sour
    honey.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input will be provided on multiple lines. There may be up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> test cases in the
    input. Each case will begin with a floating point number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; d &lt; 1000$</span>), the distance
    within which hives will fight, followed by an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 100$</span>), the number of
    hives in that case. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines will contain two floating
    point numbers separated by a single space, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-1000 \le x,y \le 1000$</span>), which give
    the position of each hive. No two hives will be at the exact
    same location. Input will be terminated by a line containing
    the string <tt class="ttfamily">0.0 0</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case output a line of the following form:
    <tt class="ttfamily">a sour, b sweet</tt> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> are the number of hives producing
    sour and sweet honey, respectively.</p>
