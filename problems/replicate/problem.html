<p>The owner of the Automatic Cellular Manufacturing
    corporation has just patented a new process for the mass
    production of identical parts. Her approach uses a
    two-dimensional lattice of two-state cells, each of which is
    either “empty” or “filled.” The exact details are, of course,
    proprietary.</p>
<p>Initially, a set of cells in the lattice is filled with a
    copy of the part that is to be reproduced. In a sequence of
    discrete steps, each cell in the lattice simultaneously updates
    its state by examining its own state and those of its eight
    surrounding neighbors. If an odd number of these nine cells are
    filled, the cell’s state in the next time step will be filled,
    otherwise it will be empty. Figure 1 shows several steps
    in the replication process for a simple pattern consisting of
    three filled cells.</p>

<p>However, a bug has crept into the process. After each update
    step, one cell in the lattice might spontaneously flip its
    state. For instance, Figure 2 shows what might happen if a
    cell flipped its state after the first time step and another
    flipped its state after the third time step.</p>

</div>
<p>Unfortunately, the original patterns were lost, and only the
    (possibly corrupted) results of the replication remain. Can you
    write a program to determine a smallest possible nonempty
    initial pattern that could have resulted in a given final
    pattern?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le w \le 300$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le h \le 300$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> are the width and height of the
    bounding box of the final pattern. Following that are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> lines, each containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> characters, giving the
    final pattern. Each character is either ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’  (representing an empty cell) or
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">#</tt>’ (representing a filled cell).
    There is at least one filled cell in the first row, in the last
    row, in the first column, and in the last column.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display a minimum-size nonempty pattern that could have
    resulted in the given pattern, assuming that at each stage of
    the replication process at most one cell spontaneously changed
    state. The size of a pattern is the area of its bounding box.
    If there is more than one possible minimum-size nonempty
    starting pattern, any one will be accepted. Use the character
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’ for empty cells and
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">#</tt>’ for filled cells. Use the minimum
    number of rows and columns needed to display the pattern.</p>
