<div class="problembody">
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> balloons
    floating in the air in a large room, lined up from left to
    right. Young Perica likes to play with arrows and practice his
    hunting abilities. He shoots an arrow from the left to the
    right side of the room from an arbitrary height he chooses. The
    arrow moves from left to right, at a chosen height <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> until it finds a balloon. The
    moment when an arrow touches a balloon, the balloon pops and
    disappears and the arrow continues its way from left to right
    at a height decreased by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Therefore, if the arrow was
    moving at height <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>,
    after popping the balloon it travels on height <span class="tex2jax_process">$H-1$</span>.</p>
<p>Our heroâ€™s goal is to pop all the balloons using as few
    arrows as possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 1\ 000\ 000$</span>). The second line of input
    contains an array of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$H_ i$</span>. Each
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$H_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq H_ i \leq 1\ 000\
    000$</span>) is the height at which the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th balloon floats, respectively
    from left to right.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the minimal
    number of times Pero needs to shoot an arrow so that all
    balloons are popped.</p>
