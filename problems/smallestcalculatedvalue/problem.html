<div class="problembody">
<p>Given three integers and the arithmetic operators
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$+$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$-$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$*$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$/$</span>), determine the smallest
    non-negative integer possible without changing the order of the
    initial integers. Order of the operators is without their
    normal precedence, just left-to-right. Note: integer division
    is fine only if the remainder is zero. For example,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9/3$</span> is okay,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10/3$</span> is not.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
      For <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, the answer is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2+3-5$</span>)<br/>
      For <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, the answer is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$9-9\ /\ 9$</span>)<br/>
      For <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, the answer is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$5-7+3$</span>)
    </blockquote>
<p>Given three integers, determine the smallest non-negative
    result that can be computed by placement of the given operators
    between the numbers. The operators may only be placed between
    numbers, not in front (they are not unary operators). An
    operator must be placed between each pair of numbers, numbers
    cannot be concatenated.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The single line of input contains three integers, all in the
    range from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1{,}000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the smallest non-negative
    value possible applying the arithmetic operators.</p>
