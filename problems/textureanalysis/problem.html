<div class="problembody">
<p>You are writing an analysis program that identifies textures
    in black-and-white images. One subroutine in this program is
    supposed to detect whether an entire row of pixels is covered
    by a pattern of regularly-spaced black pixels. That is, it
    determines if every pair of adjacent black pixels is separated
    by the same number of white pixels.</p>
<p>Write a program that simulates this subroutine using a
    textual input representation. Each row of image pixels is
    represented by a single line of text. Each asterisk (<tt class="tt">*</tt>) represents a black pixel, while each period
    (<tt class="tt">.</tt>) represents a white pixel.</p>
<p>The following line is an example of evenly-spaced black
    pixels, since each pair of adjacent black pixels are separated
    by two white pixels.</p>
<center>
<tt>*..*..*..*..*..*..*</tt>
</center>
<p>The following line is NOT an example of evenly-spaced black
    pixels, since the two leftmost black pixels are separated by
    four white pixels, but each remaining pair of adjacent black
    pixels are separated by three white pixels.</p>
<center>
<tt>*....*...*...*...*</tt>
</center>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input to your program consists of a sequence of lines, at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000$</span>. Each line
    is one row of pixels to be analyzed. Every line will start and
    end with a black pixel, and every line will contain only black
    pixels and white pixels. No line will have more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> characters.</p>
<p>The last line to process is followed by a line containing
    the word <tt class="ttfamily">END</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line, print the line number followed by <tt class="tt">EVEN</tt> if the black pixels on that line are
    evenly-spaced, or <tt class="tt">NOT EVEN</tt> if they are
    not.</p>
