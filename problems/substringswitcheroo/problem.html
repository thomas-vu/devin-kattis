<p>You and your young daughter have been playing a game to help
    teach her how to read. She of course loves learning her
    letters, rearranging them, and asking with each rearrangement,
    ‘what does this spell?’ Much of the time the letters are
    nonsense, but sometimes they form a real word.</p>
<p>She is interested in forming really <em>long</em> words, and
    as such, you have been constructing very long strings of
    run-together words. She then takes them and adds some letters,
    removes others, and generally rearranges the letters so that
    they form something that may be completely different.</p>
<p>You start writing down the strings before and after your
    daughter has changed them. The question is: what is the largest
    portion of the original string that was preserved after she
    edited it, allowing rearrangement of the letters?</p>
<p>For example, if the original string you wrote was <tt class="ttfamily">fourscoreandsevenyearsago</tt>, she might have
    shuffled all of the letters to make <tt class="ttfamily">ogasraeynevesdnaerocsruof</tt>. The second string is
    just a rearrangement of the first, so the entire original
    string was in some way preserved.</p>
<p>However, if she removes the <tt class="ttfamily">y</tt> and
    adds a <tt class="ttfamily">z</tt> and rearranges the letters
    again, the string might become <tt class="ttfamily">reedcuraanonzovresafoegss</tt>, and the longest
    substring of the original that is still a (rearranged)
    substring in the result is <tt class="ttfamily">ears</tt>
    (which is rearranged to <tt class="ttfamily">resa</tt> in her
    version).</p>
<p>Write a program that takes as input two strings: the
    original one you constructed <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, and your daughter’s edited
    version <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. Find and
    report the longest substring of <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> that is a permutation of some
    substring of <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. If there
    are multiple substrings of <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> that satisfy this criterion with
    the same length, output the one that appears first in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n\leq 10$</span>, indicating the
    number of test cases. Following this are <span class="tex2jax_process">$2n$</span> lines, each pair representing one
    test case. The first line of each test case is <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, the second is <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. Each string contains between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> characters, and uses only
    the lowercase letters <tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>–<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>. Within each test case, the two strings have
    the same length.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the longest substring of <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> that is a permutation of some
    substring of <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. If there
    are multiple longest matches, print the one that occurs
    earliest in <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>. If there
    are none, print <tt class="ttfamily">NONE</tt>.</p>
