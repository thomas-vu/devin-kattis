<p>Popular social networking site My+Din is struggling to
    manage its many popular forums. Recent regulation requires the
    site to report users engaged in conversations about certain
    topics. The sheer number of users means manual monitoring is
    too costly and so the site has asked its many interns to come
    up with a solution.</p>
<p>One intern has theorized that conversations about any given
    topic will see the same key words used over and over. If the
    most used words can be identified perhaps manual investigation
    can be directed towards appropriate forums.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le M \le 10^4$</span>), the number of
        messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> more lines each
        beginning with a user’s name of no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> characters and continuing
        with the content of that user’s message all in lower case.
        The total number of characters across all messages,
        including spaces, will not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \cdot 10^6$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Several words, one per line, listing the words used by every
    single user on the forum, ordered from most to least used and
    in case of a tie in alphabetical order. If there are no such
    words, output <tt class="ttfamily">ALL CLEAR</tt>.</p>
