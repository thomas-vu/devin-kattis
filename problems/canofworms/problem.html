<p>There is an old adage about opening a can of worms. A lesser
    known adage is one about shooting a can of exploding worms with
    a BB gun.</p>
<p>Imagine we place some cans of exploding worms on a long,
    straight fence. When a can is shot, all of the worms inside
    will explode. Different types of worms have different blast
    radii. Each can contains only one kind of worm.</p>
<p>When a can explodes, if another can is in the blast radius,
    then that can will also explode, possibly creating a chain
    reaction. Each can explodes only once. This process continues
    until all explosions stop.</p>
<p>For each can, suppose that it is the only can shot. How many
    cans in total will explode?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There will be a single test case in the input. This test
    case will begin with a line with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 100\, 000$</span>) representing the number of cans on
    the fence. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines will have two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^9 \le x \le 10^9$</span>) and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le r \le 10^9$</span>), where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is the location of the
    can on the fence and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
    is the blast radius. No two cans will occupy the same
    location.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers on a
    single line separated by single spaces. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> integer represents the number
    of cans that will explode if the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> can is the one that is
    shot.</p>
