<div class="problembody">
<p>There is a robot in a 2D grid. The grid consists of empty
    cells and obstacles, and there is exactly one cell that is the
    exit. The robot will exit the grid if it ever reaches the exit
    cell. Empty cells are denoted as ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’,
    the robot’s initial position is denoted as ‘<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>’, obstacles are denoted as ‘<tt class="ttfamily">#</tt>’, and the exit is denoted as ‘<tt class="ttfamily">E</tt>’.</p>
<p>You can program the robot by sending it a series of
    commands. The series of commands is a string consisting of
    characters: ‘<tt class="ttfamily">L</tt>’ (move one square
    left), ‘<tt class="ttfamily">U</tt>’ (move one square up),
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>’ (move one square right), or
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">D</tt>’ (move one square down). If the
    robot would run into an obstacle or off the edge of the grid,
    it will ignore the command (but it will continue on to future
    commands, if there are any).</p>
<p>Your friend sent a series of commands to the robot, but
    unfortunately, the commands do not necessarily take the robot
    to the exit.</p>
<p>You would like to fix the string so that the robot will
    reach the exit square (note once the robot reaches the exit, it
    stops, even if there are more commands in the string). You can
    fix the string with a sequence of operations. There are two
    operations: inserting a command anywhere in the string, or
    deleting a command anywhere in the string. What is the minimum
    number of operations you would need to fix the program?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that
    your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The
    first line of input contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le r, c \le 50$</span>) which are the number of rows and
    number of columns of the grid. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines will each contain a string
    with exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>
    characters. Each character is one of ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’ (Empty), ‘<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>’ (the
    Robot), ‘<tt class="ttfamily">#</tt>’ (an Obstacle), or
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">E</tt>’ (the Exit). This is the grid.
    There will be exactly one ‘<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>’ and one
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">E</tt>’ in the grid, and it will always
    be possible to navigate the robot to the exit. The last line of
    input will contain a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le |s| \le 50$</span>) of commands. The string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> will consist only of characters
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">L</tt>’ (left), ‘<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>’ (right), ‘<tt class="ttfamily">U</tt>’ (up)
    or ‘<tt class="ttfamily">D</tt>’ (down).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the minimum number of
    operations necessary to fix the command string so that the
    robot makes it to the exit.</p>
