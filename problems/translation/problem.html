<div class="problembody">
<p>You just got a summer internship at a local translation
    bureau. However, the job is very boring. They refuse to
    actually use the human mind to make translations; instead, they
    get “optimal” translations by directly translating each word
    from a dictionary. Because this is extremely boring, you want
    to optimize your job by writing a program.</p>
<p>You will be given a sentence in Swedish, and should
    translate it to English. You will also be given the
    dictionary.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input containts the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 10^4$</span>), the number of words in the
    sentence.</p>
<p>The next line of input contains a sentence consisting of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> words in Swedish, the
    sentence that you want to translate.</p>
<p>The following line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq M \leq 10^4$</span>), the number of word pairs in the
    dictionary.</p>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines,
    each containing a pair of words <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, which means that the Swedish word
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> should be translated
    to the english word <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that each <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is unique and that all words in
    the sentence to translate appears in the dictionary. All words
    in the input consist of letters <tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>-<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt> and are at most
    15 letters long. Some of the words may not be real Swedish or
    English words.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the sentence, where each word has been translated from
    Swedish to English.</p>
