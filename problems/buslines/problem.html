<p>After many years without any public transport, the town
    Krockholm will finally get a network of bus lines. The plans
    are still on the drawing board, but it has been decided that
    there shall be <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    stations labelled <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> bus lines where each line connects
    two stations. The only thing remaining is to decide which pairs
    of stations should be connected. One important requirement is
    that it should be possible to get from any station to any
    other. In addition to this, someone had the brilliant idea that
    the bus lines should be labelled by the sum of their endpoints.
    This means that all of these sums must be different.</p>
<p>You are given two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>. Construct a graph with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> edges and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> vertices labelled <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, such that:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>The graph is connected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sums of edge endpoints are distinct.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n \leq 100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq
    m \leq 10^4$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is not possible to construct a graph with the given
    properties, print “<tt class="ttfamily">-1</tt>”. Otherwise,
    print <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines where the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th line contains two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span>, the endpoints of
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th edge. If there
    are many possible solutions, any one of them will be
    accepted.</p>
