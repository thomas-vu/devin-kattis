<p>Anyone knows that the best place to learn the art of
    espionage is at the Manhattan Academy of Private Spies (MAPS).
    Scattered across Manhattan are a number of safe houses, which
    are used by MAPS when conducting drills. During a drill, each
    spy-in-training is required to travel from their current
    location to the nearest safe house. If there are multiple safe
    houses that are nearest to their current location, then it does
    not matter which safe house that spy chooses to travel to. Each
    safe house is large enough to accommodate any number of
    spies.</p>
<p>Manhattan is modeled as a grid of city blocks. Initially
    (before any drill), each block may contain a single safe house
    or a single spy, but not both. The distance between two city
    blocks is measured using Manhattan distance, also known as
    taxicab distance. Formally, the Manhattan distance between two
    locations is the sum of the absolute value of their vertical
    difference and the absolute value of their horizontal
    difference.</p>
<p>What is the maximum Manhattan distance that any spy has to
    travel to reach the nearest safe house?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq N\leq 100$</span>, denoting the width
    and height of the grid. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> characters, with each character
    denoting a city block. A spy is represented by an ‘<tt class="ttfamily">S</tt>’ character, a safe house is represented by an
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">H</tt>’ character, and the remaining city
    blocks in the grid are represented by ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’ (period) characters. There is at least
    one spy and at least one safe house.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output an integer indicating the maximum Manhattan distance
    that any spy has to travel in order to reach the nearest safe
    house.</p>
