<p>The “Countdown” TV show has a part that consists of
    obtaining a number by combining six different numbers using the
    basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, product
    and division. The basic rules for the game are:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The contestant selects six of twenty-four shuffled
        tiles. The tiles are arranged into two groups: four “large
        numbers” (<span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$75$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>) and the remainder “small
        numbers”, which comprise two each of the numbers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. Hence the tiles have the
        values <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
        7, 8, 9, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100\} $</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contestants then have thirty seconds to get a number
        as close to the target as possible by combining the six
        selected numbers using addition, subtraction,
        multiplication and division.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Not all numbers need to be used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A number can be used only as many times as it
        appears.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fractions are not allowed, only positive integers may be
        used at any stage of the calculation.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Example:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Contestant requests two large numbers and four small
        numbers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selection is: <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 75, 50,
        2, 3, 8, 7\} $</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Randomly generated target is: <span class="tex2jax_process">$812$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contestant declares result: <span class="tex2jax_process">$813$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Contestant gives details: <span class="tex2jax_process">$75 + 50 = 125$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$125 - 8 = 117$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$117 \cdot 7 = 819$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \cdot 2 = 6$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$819 - 6 = 813$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Expert notes: <span class="tex2jax_process">$50 + 8 =
        58$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$7 \cdot 2 =
        14$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$14 \cdot 58 =
        812$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your task is to write a program that calculates the best
    sequence of operations that lead to the target number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>. If there is no way to
    get <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, give the closest
    solution.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several cases, one per line. The first
    line indicates the number of cases to process (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C \leq 5$</span>). Each of the
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> lines
    contains six natural numbers from the set <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 25, 50,
    75, 100\} $</span> and another natural number <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$ 1
    \leq T \leq 999 $</span>) that indicates the target.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output for each case will be a set of lines with the
    following format:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>First line: <tt class="ttfamily">Target:</tt> number
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines: sequence
        of operations, the format is <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathtt{operand_1\; operator\; operand_2
        = result}$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last line: <tt class="ttfamily">Best approx:</tt> number
        obtained</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Blank line</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>See example for a better understanding. If there is more
    than one best approximation, all of them will be considered
    valid. The sequence of operations should be valid, you should
    never use a value before you obtain it. It is OK to print more
    operations than needed as long as they are valid. Note that all
    the numbers and operators must be separated by at least one
    space.</p>
