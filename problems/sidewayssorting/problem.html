<p>We are so accustomed to reading strings from left to right,
    it can be a little difficult to think of strings that go right
    to left or even vertically. Here’s your chance to get some
    practice.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> test cases. Each test case
    starts with a line containing a pair of integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le r, c \le 15$</span>. This is followed
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines each
    containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> characters
    chosen from A–Z (lowercase and uppercase). The last test case
    is followed by values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> for both <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print out a block of text containing the
    same columns as the input block but in sorted order. Think of
    each column as a string reading from top to bottom. Your output
    block should have the columns sorted lexicographically from
    left to right. Your sort should be a stable sort and it should
    ignore case. Print a blank line between each pair of adjacent
    output blocks.</p>
