<div class="problembody">
<p>Bob is texting Alice about his favourite programming
    problems, but he spilled coffee on his keyboard and now the
    keys get stuck when he types. The other day, he tried to tell
    her about the upcoming contest “UAPC”, but accidentally sent
    “UAAAAAPC” since his A key got stuck! Bob is an undergraduate
    so he can’t afford a new keyboard. He has asked you to write a
    program to correct his messages.</p>
<p>To make your life easier, Bob has agreed to avoid using
    messages with adjacent copies of the same letter (e.g., he
    won’t write about the “coffee” incident). So, you should always
    reduce duplicates down to a single character.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le |S| \le 1000$</span>, which is Bob’s
    entire message to Alice. There may be multiple space-separated
    words in the message, so the entire string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> <i class="itshape">including</i>
    spaces should be considered part of the message.</p>
<p>The string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is
    guaranteed to only include upper and lower-case characters,
    digits, and spaces. Thankfully, the coffee did not reach Bob’s
    spacebar so there will never be multiple spaces in a row.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the message with repeated consecutive characters
    trimmed to a single character.</p>
