<p>Aristid is the mayor of a town called Linden. He and the
    townsfolk love fractals. One day, Aristid decides to
    genetically alter trees so that they have mathematically
    pleasing structures. It turns out that the people of Linden
    will support this idea only if the trees are sufficiently
    “tree-like.” So Aristid came up with the following system to
    generate realistic looking trees. Since he’s a little vain, he
    decided to call it the Linden Mayor System.</p>
<p>Start with a sequence of letters <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_0$</span>. This is the seed that will be
    used to generate the rest of the tree. Next define some rules
    to model the branching behavior of the tree. A rule will have
    the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$x \rightarrow
    y$</span>, indicating that the letter <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> will be replaced with the sequence
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>. By applying these
    rules to <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_0$</span>, the new
    sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_1$</span> is created.
    These rules can be applied over and over to produce new
    sequences. In general, to create <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_{n+1}$</span> from <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ n$</span>, replace all the letters in
    sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ n$</span> according
    to the rules. Some letters may not have a rule associated with
    them. Such <em>terminal</em> letters are not replaced.</p>
<p>As an example, consider the starting sequence A with rules:
    A <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span> AB and B
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span> A. The
    first four iterations are as follows:</p>

<p>A is replaced with AB by rule A <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span> AB. Note that

          $</span> A couldn’t be applied.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line will contain two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq n \leq 26$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq m \leq 5$</span>. Following this will
    be <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines defining the
    rules for a Linden Mayor System. Each line is of the form:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> <tt class="ttfamily">-&gt;</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>,
    indicating that <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is
    replaced by <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is an uppercase letter
    from A to Z, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> will
    contain between one and five uppercase letters from A to Z. The
    last line will contain the starting sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_0$</span>, which is non-empty and no
    longer than <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span>
    characters and will contain only uppercase letters from A to
    Z.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the resulting sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ m$</span> which is produced after
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> iterations.</p>
