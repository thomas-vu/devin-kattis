<p>Larry developed a new driverless car, and he’s about to test
    it. He’ll be working from home and analyzing what the car does
    in a straight, empty road from a safe distance.</p>
<p>Due to an unprecedented issue, the only information that
    Larry’s able to get from the car is its position in meters from
    the start of the road. While he gets an update every minute, he
    would like to know what the car has been doing.</p>
<p>Given three distinct positions <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> taken one minute from each other,
    Larry would like to know if the car switched direction, or if
    it braked, accelerated, or cruised at the same speed. Can you
    help out Larry?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single line with three distinct
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq
    a, b, c \leq 1\, 000$</span>, the position of the car in meters
    from the start of the road, measured every minute.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the car changed direction, output <tt class="ttfamily">turned</tt>. Otherwise, output <tt class="ttfamily">accelerated</tt> if it travelled a greater distance
    in the second minute than the first, <tt class="ttfamily">braked</tt> if it travelled a smaller distance in
    the second minute than the first, or <tt class="ttfamily">cruised</tt> if it travelled the same distance
    during both minutes.</p>
