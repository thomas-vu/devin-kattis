<p>It is Gregâ€™s birthday! To celebrate, his friend Sam invites
    Greg and two other friends for a small party. Of course, every
    birthday party must have cake.</p>
<p>Sam ordered a square cake. She makes a single horizontal cut
    and a single vertical cut. In her excitement to eat cake, Sam
    forgot to make these cuts through the middle of the cake.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest piece of cake should go to Greg since
    it is his birthday. Help Sam determine the volume of the
    biggest piece of cake that resulted from these two cuts.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 10\, 000$</span>), the length
    of the sides of the square cake in centimeters, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; h &lt; n$</span>), the distance of the horizontal cut from
    the top edge of the cake in centimeters, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; v &lt; n$</span>), the distance of the vertical cut from
    the left edge of the cake in centimeters. This is illustrated
    in the figure above.</p>
<p>Each cake is <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>
    centimeters thick.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the volume (in cubic centimeters) of the largest of
    the four pieces of cake after the horizontal and vertical cuts
    are made.</p>
