<p>Now that the Loonie is hovering about par with the
    Greenback, you have decided to use your $1000 Canadian dollars
    entrance scholarship to engage in currency speculation. So you
    gaze into a crystal ball which predicts the closing exchange
    rate between Canadian and U.S. dollars for each of the
    next several days. On any given day, you can switch all of your
    money from Canadian to U.S. dollars, or vice versa, at the
    prevailing exchange rate, less a 3% commission, rounded down to
    the nearest cent.</p>
<p>Assuming your crystal ball is correct, what’s the maximum
    amount of money you can have, in Canadian dollars, when you’re
    done?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a number of test cases, followed by a
    line containing 0. Each test case begins with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; d \le 365$</span>, the number of days
    that your crystal ball can predict. <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> lines follow, giving the price of
    a U.S. dollar in Canadian dollars, as a real number. The
    price will always be positive and between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.93$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1.1$</span> dollars.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line giving the maximum amount
    of money, in Canadian dollars and cents, that it is possible to
    have at the end of the last prediction, assuming you may
    exchange money on any subset of the predicted days, in
    order.</p>
