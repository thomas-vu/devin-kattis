<div class="problembody">
<p>You have placed 25 lettered tiles in a nice, neat
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \times 5$</span> grid like the
    first one below. You start to slide the tiles around one space
    at a time, either up, down, left or right. As you move a tile,
    it pushes along any tiles ahead of it. For example, if you push
    the <tt class="ttfamily">M</tt> to the right, then push the
    <tt class="ttfamily">X</tt> up, <tt class="ttfamily">V</tt> to
    the right and <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt> to the left, your
    nice neat grid would end up looking like the second picture.
    Your job is to write a simulation of this process.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> test cases. At the start of each
    test case, the tiles are reset to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \times 5$</span> grid in the first picture
    above. Input for each test case starts with a line containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n \le 50$</span>. This is
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines,
    each describing a move of a tile. A move is of the form
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> up, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> down, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> left or <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> right, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is a capital letter from
    <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt> to <tt class="ttfamily">Y</tt>. The
    end of all test cases is marked with a value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> for <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, produce a picture of the state of the
    board after all moves have completed. The topmost tile should
    appear on the first row and the bottommost should appear on the
    last. Similarly, the leftmost tile should be on the first
    column and the rightmost on the last. Some rows may be empty,
    but donâ€™t use any extra spaces at the end of any row. Follow
    each test case with one blank row.</p>
