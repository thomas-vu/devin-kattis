<p>Lárus is a middle manager at a stellar company, He manages
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> members of the staff,
    all of which are related to him except for one.</p>
<p>When a new assignment pops up, Lárus is in charge of
    assigning it to a member of the staff. Lárus wants to minimise
    the work his relatives must do. However, he cannot simply pick
    the same person every time.</p>
<p>To ensure people do not believe Lárus is practising
    nepotism, He lines the people up in a circle and uses a mantra
    to pick a person at random for the assignment. First he picks a
    staff member at which to point and recites the first word. He
    then recites the rest of the mantra and points to the next
    staff member to the right for each word that he recites.</p>
<p>The mantra is as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
      Úllen dúllen doff kikke lane koff koffe lane bikke bane úllen
      dúllen doff.
    </blockquote>
<p>How can Lárus line up the staff members so that his
    relatives do not get the assignment?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of staff members. Then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines follow, where
    each line contains one name. The first name is the staff member
    which is not related to Lárus.</p>
<p>You may assume that each name is unique and consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> lowercase English letters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, where
    each line contains one name of a staff member and such that no
    name is repeated. Lárus will use the ordering you output to
    recite the mantra and pick the staff member receiving the
    assignment. If the ordering you output results in one of his
    relatives being picked, then your solution will be considered
    wrong.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>The number of staff members, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, can range from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>. There exists a test group for
    each possible value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    and each group is worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> points. You must solve all the
    test cases in a test group to earn the points for that
    group.</p>
<h2>Explanation of samples</h2>
<p>In the first sample, one possible solution is to iterate
    through the same order as the input, resulting in the following
    steps:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Úllen: Arnar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dúllen: Atli</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>doff: Bjarni</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kikke: Bjarki</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lane: Hannes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>koff: Unnar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>koffe: Arnar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lane: Atli</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bikke: Bjarni</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bane: Bjarki</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>úllen: Hannes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dúllen: Unnar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>doff: Arnar</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since Arnar ends up being the final choice, the output is
    considered correct.</p>
<p>In the second sample, one possible answer is to iterate
    through the following order:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Úllen: v</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dúllen: x</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>doff: y</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>kikke: a</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lane: b</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>koff: c</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>koffe: p</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>lane: q</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bikke: r</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>bane: s</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>úllen: t</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>dúllen: u</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>doff: z</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the end, z is chosen and the output is considered
    correct.</p>
<p>Note that many other correct outputs exist and that in the
    second sample we do not reach the final two values in the order
    given.</p>
