<div class="problembody">
<p>Anthony has a pet hamster named Diablo. Diablo enjoys having
    lots of space to move around, so Anthony wants to build him a
    cage that covers as much area as possible.</p>
<p>However, Diablo also likes to dig and hide very much, and
    when he does, it is an absolute pain for Anthony to find Diablo
    (Diablo is very good at hiding). Therefore, Anthony wants to
    make sure the cage he builds for Diablo is not too big. In
    particular, Anthony wants to make sure the area of the cage is
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> square meters;
    any area larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>
    square meters will be too much work to find Diablo when he
    hides, any area smaller than <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> square meters will be too
    uncomfortable for Diablo.</p>
<p>Anthony has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> meters
    of fencing that can be cut/bent at any point, and wonders if it
    is possible to build a cage <em>of any shape</em> that has area
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> with the
    materials he has. Write a program to help him out!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains two real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0&lt;A\leq 100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq N\leq 1000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line with “Diablo is happy!” if Anthony can
    build his cage for Diablo, “Need more materials!”
    otherwise.</p>
