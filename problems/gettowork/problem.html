<div class="problembody">
<p>You work for a company that has <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> employees working in town
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>. There are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> towns in the area
    where the employees live. You want to ensure that everyone will
    be able to make it to work. Some of the employees are drivers
    and can drive <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>
    passengers. A capacity of <span class="tex2jax_process">$P =
    1$</span> indicates that the driver can only transport
    themselves to work. You want to ensure that everyone will be
    able to make it to work and you would like to minimize the
    number of cars on the road.</p>
<p>You want to calculate the number of cars on the road, with
    these requirements:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Every employee can get to town <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only way an employee may travel between towns is in
        a car belonging to an employee.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Employees can only take rides from other employees that
        live in the same town.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The minimum number of cars is used.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Find whether it is possible for everyone to make it to work,
    and if it is, how many cars will end up driving to the
    office.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>One line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$C, C \leq 100$</span>, the number of test
    cases in the input file.</p>
<p>For each test case there will be:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of towns in your
        area and the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the town where the office is
        located.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$E, 1 \leq E \leq 500$</span>, the number
        of employees.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> lines, one for
        each employee, each containing:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>An integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq H
            \leq N$</span>, the home town of the employee, followed
            by</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq P
            \leq 6$</span>, the number of passengers they can
            drive. If the employee is not licensed to drive the
            number will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T
    \leq N, 1 \leq N \leq 100$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> lines, one for
        each test case in the order they occur in the input file,
        each containing the string “Case #<span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>: ” where <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is the number of the test
        case, starting from 1, followed by:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The string “<tt class="tt">IMPOSSIBLE</tt>”, if
            there are not enough drivers for everyone to commute;
            or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
            space-separated integers, one for each town from
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, which
            indicate the number of vehicles commuting from the
            town.</p>
