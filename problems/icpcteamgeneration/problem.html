<p>Vi is a coach for her university’s ICPC organization and is
    working on creating teams for their upcoming regional contest.
    They recently competed in the North America Qualifier and Vi is
    using the results as well as each person’s preferences to
    create as many teams of three as possible to send to
    regionals.</p>
<p>More specifically, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    people from Vi’s university competed in the North America
    Qualifier (NAQ), and each person got a unique rank from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. The person at rank <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> has two parameters, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ r$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ r \le r \le b_ r$</span>, indicating that
    their two teammates must have a rank between <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ r$</span>, inclusive. Teams must have
    exactly three people.</p>
<p>Due to the collaborative environment, Vi notes that for
    every pair of individuals at ranks <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$i &lt; j$</span>, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i \le a_ j$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i \le b_ j$</span>.</p>
<p>Compute the maximum number of teams that Vi can send to
    regionals</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le n \le 50$</span>), which is the number
    of competitors in the local contest.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
    r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ r$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ r \le r \le b_ r$</span>),
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is the
    competitor’s rank. These are the limits of the ranks of the
    competitors that can be teamed with this competitor. The
    competitors are given in rank order, from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$i &lt; j$</span>, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i \le a_ j$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i \le b_ j$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the maximum number of
    teams Vi can send to the regional contest.</p>
