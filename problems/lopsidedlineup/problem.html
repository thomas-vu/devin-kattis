        Unbalanced scales<br/>

<p>Together with your coworker, Sergey, you are organizing the
    exciting Billiards and Pool Competition for your coworkers in
    your small company. However, communication has not been great
    between you two. You are not sure you and Sergey think alike,
    but as far as you are concerned, this would be a great
    opportunity to do some team building. The actual prizes are
    meaningless, but there is possibly a lot to be gained from this
    in team bonding. You want to maximise result.</p>
<p>You start reading some pseudo-scientific books on team
    management, and after some research, you conclude that there
    are two good ways of team bonding: people feel more connected
    after either a triumphant victory or a crushing defeat. This
    gives you a great idea: if you divide your coworkers into two
    groups that are as far apart in skill level as possible, both
    teams will experience improved bonding! You therefore think it
    is optimal to try to make the teams as unbalanced as possible.
    Make sure, however, that the teams are of equal size.</p>
<p>With a bit of work you come up with a nice model for the
    strength of a team. You think team strength is mainly
    determined by how well two players play together, whether they
    encourage one another and complement each otherâ€™s weaknesses.
    Whenever two players <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> are in the same
    team, they increase the team score by an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_{i,j}$</span>. The total score of a team
    is thus equal to the sum of <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_{i,j}$</span>, over all unordered pairs of
    players <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> in the team.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an even integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq n\leq 1000$</span>), the total
        number of players.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th of which
        contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_{i,1}, c_{i,2}, \dots ,
        c_{i, n}$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^6\leq
        c_{i,j} \leq 10^6$</span>).</p>
<p>For any <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, it is guaranteed
        that <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_{i,i} = 0$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_{i,j} =
        c_{j,i}$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum possible difference in strength between
    two teams of equal size.</p>
