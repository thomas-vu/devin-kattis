<p>It’s the year 3035, and you are Chief Relationship Officer
    on the Pluto colonization mission, currently en route to the
    beigeish not-planet. Your task is to make sure that there is no
    excessive amount of relationship drama during the 10 year long
    trip. The biggest source of issues are the so-called
    <em>triangle dramas</em>. These are formed when three single
    people have a pairwise quite high potential for starting a
    relationship. If two people in a triangle drama starts a
    relationship, the tension created with the third person may be
    an obstacle to the mission<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The ship’s relationship AI used to analyze the potential for
    triangle drama on the ship continuously for you, until it broke
    down after its partner, the navigation system, had an affair
    with life-support. Until it has watched enough romcoms to be
    ready to “get back out there”, you’ll have to perform this
    analysis yourself.</p>
<p>If three people have pairwise relationship potential
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, their potential for drama is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$abc$</span>. Write a program to
    find the three singles with the highest potential for drama,
    given the relationship potential of all couples on the
    ship.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \le N \le 100$</span>), the number of singles on the
    mission.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    describe the relationship potentials of everyone on the ship.
    Each line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, the relationship
    potential in percent. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>’th number on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th line describes the relationship
    potential between people <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
<p>The relationship potential is symmetric, and a person always
    has relationship potential <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> with themselves (narcissism is
    filtered out during the pre-mission psychological
    evaluation).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output three integers – the indices of the people with the
    highest potential for drama in increasing order. If there are
    several triangle dramas <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a, b,
    c)$</span> with the same potential for drama, choose first the
    one with the smallest <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>,
    and if tied, the smallest <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, and if still tied, the smallest
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>..</p>
