<div class="problembody">
<p>Fred and Sam are traveling together. Both have maps of the
    area. The maps cover exactly the same territory, and have
    exactly the same ratio of width to height, but Sam’s is at a
    smaller scale than Fred’s, so it’s a bit smaller. Fred puts his
    map on a table. Sam throws his map on top of it. The smaller
    map is offset and rotated, but it still fits entirely on top of
    the bigger map. Fred sticks a pin in the smaller map. The pin
    goes all the way through to the bigger map. Sam is amazed! He
    says “Wow! Do you realize that the position of that pin
    represents the same place on BOTH maps?” Fred says “it’s really
    not so amazing. There has to be one such point!”</p>
<p>Given the dimensions of a large map, and the offset, scale
    and rotation of a smaller map that is entirely on top of the
    larger map, find the single point that represents the same
    place on both maps.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There will be up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span> test cases in the input. Each
    test case will consist of a single line with six integers:</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">      w h x y
    s r</tt></p>
<p>The first two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; w, h \le 1\, 000$</span>) are the width and height of the
    larger map. The larger map will be on a plane, with the
    southwest corner at the origin, the northwest corner at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,h)$</span>, the southeast
    corner at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(w,0)$</span>, and the
    northeast corner at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(w,h)$</span>.</p>
<p>The next two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le x \le w$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le y \le
    h$</span>), represent the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> coordinate on the plane of the
    southwest corner of the smaller map.</p>
<p>The integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; s &lt; 100$</span>)
    represents the scale of smaller map as a percentage of the
    larger map (<span class="tex2jax_process">$s=50$</span> means
    that the smaller map has half the width and half the height of
    the larger map).</p>
<p>The integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le r &lt; 360$</span>) is
    the angle, in degrees, of counter-clockwise rotation of the
    smaller map around its southwest corner (<span class="tex2jax_process">$r=90$</span> means that the southeast corner
    is rotated to be due north of the southwest corner).</p>
<p>The smaller map is guaranteed to lie completely within the
    borders of the larger map. The input will end with a line with
    six <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>s.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output two real numbers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, representing the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> coordinate of the point where
    both maps represent the same place. Output the numbers with
    exactly two decimal places of accuracy, with a single space
    between them. The fractional part of <span class="tex2jax_process">$100x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100y$</span> will be bounded away from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.5$</span> by at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
