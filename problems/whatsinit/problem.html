<div class="problembody">
<p>Pekka has started preparing for the beautiful summer on the
    beaches along the great Finnish lakes. He has started his
    yearly spring diet. Although the diet is very strict and
    boring, it has given Pekka fruitful results for the last
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> years as well as an
    increased interest in the food he eats. He always reads the
    ingredient list of a food item before he puts it into his
    basket in the grocery store. He has a hard time getting a full
    overview of how much of each ingredient he actually puts in his
    body and would like your help to figure it out.</p>
<p>The ingredient list on a food item always lists all the
    ingredients, but it seldom tells you how much is used of each
    one of the single ingredients. It will often tell you how much
    is used for some of the ingredients. The ingredients list is
    always sorted from the ingredient with the most content to the
    ingredient with the least content.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> indicating the number
    of ingredients in the thing Pekka wants to eat.<br/>
    Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    describe one ingredient, and consist of one word <span class="tex2jax_process">$I$</span> and one number <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, describing the name of the
    ingredient and the percentage of the ingredient in this piece
    of food – if known, otherwise it is a ’?’.<br/>
    The <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> ingredients are
    listed in the order on the package of the food item.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a list of ingredients, one line
    for each ingredient, in the same order as they were given in
    the input. Each line should consist of an ingredient name
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$I$</span>, and two non-negative
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>, describing the
    minimal and maximal possible quantity of the ingredient in the
    actual food item.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq
        1000$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq \operatorname
        {len}(I) \leq 100$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is an integer
        if the percentage of this ingredient is known, or a
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$?$</span> if it is not
        known.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is known:
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq P \leq
        100$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq \sum (P) \leq
        100$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$I$</span> consists of the
        letters from A-Z and a-z.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each ingredient name <span class="tex2jax_process">$I$</span> is unique.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is guaranteed that there exists a solution.</p>
