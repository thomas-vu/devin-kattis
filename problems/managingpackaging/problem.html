<div class="problembody">
<p>Modern operating system distributions have tools to manage
    installed software, making it easy to keep the software
    up-to-date. Putting different pieces of software into
    ‘packages’ that can be installed separately keeps things simple
    and avoids duplicate effort and code. But this means that a
    package may depend on other packages, requiring their
    installation before that package can be installed. For example,
    many programs need to use ‘libc,’ which contains standard
    C-library functions. To keep track of these dependencies, many
    distributions use some sort of package manager.</p>
<p>When a user wants to install a new package (or set of
    packages), a package manager takes care of the headache of
    tracking down which packages are required to install the
    desired package. Of course, those may also depend on other
    packages.</p>
<p>For this problem, determine an order (if one exists) that
    allows a given list of packages to be installed. No package
    should be installed before all the packages it depends on are
    installed. You may assume that, at the beginning, no packages
    have been installed.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> test cases. Each test case start
    with a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1\,
    000$</span>, which is the number of packages the user wants to
    install. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines which describe <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> packages. Each package description
    starts with the name of the package and is followed by a
    space-separated list of the package’s unique dependencies. Each
    package has at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>
    dependencies, and each is one of the other <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> packages. Each package name is a
    string of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span>
    non-whitespace characters using the English alphabet (a-z,
    A-Z), digits (0-9), as well as the characters <tt>_</tt>,
    <tt>-</tt>, <tt>.</tt>, and <tt>+</tt> (i.e. underscore, minus,
    period, and plus). Input ends when <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the order of package installation
    that allow them all to be installed after their respective
    dependencies. If there are multiple possible orderings, then
    give the ordering that is lexicographically first (using ASCII
    values for string ordering). If there is some group of packages
    that are not able to be ordered within the list, output
    ‘<tt class="tt">cannot be ordered</tt>’ instead of ordering the
    packages. Put a blank line between each pair of test cases.</p>
