<div class="problembody">
<p>The annual student team competition in table tennis of
    students enrolled in University of Zagreb takes place next
    Saturday! Each team consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> students. The excited students,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> of them, are waiting
    in queue to register.</p>
<p>Krešo works at the registration desk. He doesn’t really feel
    like doing his job so he decided not to allow students to
    choose a team. He decided that the first team will consist of
    the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> students
    standing in queue, the second team the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> students, the third one the
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> students and
    so on…(<span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> will be
    divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> so nobody
    is left hanging.)</p>
<p>Ante has estimated the skill of each player with an integer.
    He would like to have the <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> strongest players in the first
    team, the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    strongest in the second team and so on…</p>
<p>Krešo has just taken a break and Ante decided to shift the
    students standing in queue so that he achieves his goal. The
    way he shifts them is that he tells a student to step out of
    the queue and go back in queue after another student or to go
    to the front of the queue. It takes him one minute to do
    this.</p>
<p>It’s possible that Krešo is going to return from his break
    any moment so Ante needs to achieve his goal as soon as
    possible. Help Ante determine the minimal number of minutes
    necessary for him to achieve his goal.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq K \leq N \leq 100\, 000)$</span>. The integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is going to divisible by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq v_ i \leq 10^9$</span>), the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th number denotes the
    skill of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th player
    standing in queue – lower value means higher skill.</p>
<p>All contestants are going to have distinct levels of
    skill.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the minimal
    required number of minutes.</p>
