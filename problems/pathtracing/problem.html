<p>Billy likes to wander around. Each day he follows a sequence
    of up, down, left and right moves. At the end of the day, he
    would like to know where he’s been. You are going to help by
    providing Billy with a program that draws a map for him. The
    program should read a sequence of moves he makes on a given day
    and produce a map showing where he’s been.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input is a sequence of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span> moves, one move per line, until
    end of file. Each move is one of <tt class="ttfamily">left</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">right</tt>,
    <tt class="ttfamily">up</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">down</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a map of the path described by the sequence of moves.
    Mark the start and end locations with <tt class="ttfamily">S</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">E</tt>,
    respectively. Mark other locations with <tt>*</tt>. Outline the
    whole map with a rectangle made of the # character. The whole
    map is the smallest rectangle containing the path. The path
    never starts and ends at the same location. Use spaces to
    indicate parts of the map which are not visited by the path,
    but do not use any extra spaces (e.g. outside the map
    outline).</p>
