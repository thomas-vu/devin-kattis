<p>Lucy is making her road bike ready for the season. All parts
    have been checked for wear and tear and washed clean and she is
    ready to put the beauty back together again. There is only one
    thing troubling her. During the winter she has been to several
    motivational talks by previous professional cyclists. They have
    all talked about the importance of correct cadence while
    cycling. The cadence is the frequency your feet are pedaling at
    when you are cycling. Lucy is now wondering if she should
    change her gears setup before she reassembles the bike and goes
    on her first ride for the year.</p>
<p>Bike gears typically consist of a set of different-sized
    gears on the crank (the thing connected to the pedals) and a
    set of different-sized gears on the back wheel. These are
    connected by the chain to drive the bike forward. Can you help
    her figure out if she can keep her current setup and still
    change to all gears without it affecting her cadence too much?
    Specifically she does not want her cadence to be increased by
    more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>% when
    changing to the next lighter gear. We assume that the bicycle
    will continue at the same speed immediately after the gear
    change.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> representing the number of gears
    on the crank, the numbers of gears on the back wheel, and the
    maximum cadence change in percentage Lucy will tolerate when
    changing gears.<br/>
    Then follows a line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ i$</span> each representing the number of
    teeth on each of the gears on the crank.<br/>
    Then follows a line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ j$</span> each representing the number of
    teeth on each of the gears on the back wheel.<br/></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line with the text <tt class="ttfamily">Ride
    on!</tt> if Lucy can change through all the gears from heaviest
    to lightest in her current setup and <tt class="ttfamily">Time
    to change gears!</tt> if she cannot.</p>
