<div class="description"></div>
</div>A bee larva living in a hexagonal cell of a large
    honeycomb decides to creep for a walk. In each “step” the larva
    may move into any of the six adjacent cells and after
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> steps, it is to end up
    in its original cell.

    <p>Your program has to compute, for a given <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of different such
    larva walks.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer giving the number of test
    cases to follow. Each case consists of one line containing an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 14$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing the number of
    walks. Under the assumption <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le
    n\le 14$</span>, the answer will be less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{31}$</span>.</p>
