<div class="problembody">
<p><em>We were afraid of making this problem statement too
    boring, so we decided to keep it short</em>. A sequence is
    called <em>non-boring</em> if its every connected subsequence
    contains a unique element, i.e. an element such that no other
    element of that subsequence has the same value. Given a
    sequence of integers, decide whether it is
    <em>non-boring</em>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains the number of test
    cases <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le T \le 100\, 000$</span>.
    The descriptions of the test cases follow:</p>
<p>Each test case starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 200\, 000$</span>) denoting the length of the
    sequence. In the next line the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> elements of the sequence follow,
    separated with single spaces. The elements are non-negative
    integers less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>.
    The sum of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> over all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases is at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 500\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the answers to the test cases in the order in which
    they appear in the input. For each test case print a single
    line containing the word <tt>non-boring</tt> or
    <tt>boring</tt>.</p>
