<p>Ancay youyay eakspay igpay atinlay? (Can you speak pig
    latin?) If you can’t, here are the rules:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If a word begins with a consonant, take all of the
        letters before the first vowel and move them to the end of
        the word, then add <i class="itshape">ay</i> to the end of
        the word. Examples: <i class="itshape">pig</i> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\to $</span> <i class="itshape">igpay</i>, <i class="itshape">there</i>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$\to $</span> <i class="itshape">erethay</i>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a word begins with a vowel (<i class="itshape">a</i>,
        <i class="itshape">e</i>, <i class="itshape">i</i>,
        <i class="itshape">o</i>, <i class="itshape">u</i>, or
        <i class="itshape">y</i>), simply add <i class="itshape">yay</i> to the end of the word. For this problem,
        <i class="itshape">y</i> is always a vowel. Examples:
        <i class="itshape">and</i> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\to $</span> <i class="itshape">andyay</i>, <i class="itshape">ordinary</i>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$\to $</span> <i class="itshape">ordinaryyay</i>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Although there are many variants of Pig Latin (such as
    Kedelkloppersprook in Germany), for this problem we will always
    use the rules described above.</p>
<p>A friend of yours was frustrated with everyone writing in
    Pig Latin and has asked you to write a program to translate to
    Pig Latin for him. Ouldway youyay ebay osay indkay otay oday
    ityay? (Would you be so kind to do it?)</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$4\, 000$</span> lines, ending
    at end of file. Each line contains up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> words, each word up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> characters long,
    using only the characters a–z (lowercase). Every word contains
    at least one vowel, and adjacent words are separated by a
    single space. No punctuation or special characters will appear
    in the input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Your program should output the text translated to Pig Latin
    using the rules described above.</p>
