<p>The Vietnamese High School graduation exam is in progress!
    For most Vietnamese high school students, this is their most
    important exam, as its result not only decides whether they can
    graduate from high school, but is also used for their
    university applications.</p>

        Multiple Choice Test</a>.

<p>Today, Hanh finished his final exam, Math, which is Hanh’s
    strongest subject. In this exam, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> questions, numbered from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Each one is a multiple choice
    question, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>
    answers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>. The students have to write the
    answers on an answer sheet with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line should contain the answer
    for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th question.
    Each question has only one correct answer, and the student will
    receive one point if their answer matches the correct one.</p>
<p>Hanh started checking his results with his friends
    confidently. After few minutes, Hanh’s confidence turned into
    fright: Most of Hanh’s answers are different from his
    friends’.</p>
<p>Hanh quickly realized that he made a terrible mistake: Hanh
    wrote the answer for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>nd question on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>st line of the answer sheet, the
    answer for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>rd
    question on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>nd
    line, the answer for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>th question on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>rd line, and so on. Hanh left the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-th line of the answer
    sheet empty, and did not write the answer for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>st question anywhere!</p>
<p>Please help Hanh check what will be his final score. Given
    that Hanh is a great Math student, his answers for all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> questions would be
    correct if they were on the correct line of the answer
    sheet.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le n \le 1\, 000)$</span> — the
        number of questions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines follow,
        the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line
        contains a single character, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> — the correct answer for
        the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
        question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single integer — Hanh’s final score.</p>
<h2>Explanation of the first sample input</h2>
<p>Fortunately for Hanh, all <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> questions have <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> as correct answer. So Hanh wrote
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> on the first three
    lines, and left the <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-th
    line empty. Hanh’s final score is <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>.</p>
