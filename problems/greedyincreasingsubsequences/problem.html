<div class="problembody">
<p>Jimmy’s homework is to find a long increasing subsequence of
    a given sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2,
    \ldots , a_ n$</span>. But the sequence is really long! Jimmy
    doesn’t know how to do this effectively.</p>
<p>So Jimmy takes a greedy approach. He begins by picking the
    first number in the sequence. Then he repeats the following
    rule until it no longer applies: pick the next number in the
    sequence that is bigger than the number he just picked.</p>
<p>More precisely, Jimmy picks the subsequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \ldots , a_{i_ k}$</span>
    where:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$i_1 = 1$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq j &lt;
        k$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$i_{j+1}$</span>
        is the smallest index greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$i_ j$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i_ j} &lt; a_{i_{j+1}}$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i_ k} \geq a_\ell
        $</span> for every <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell &gt;
        i_ k$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jimmy realizes that this may not produce a very long
    subsequence. So to help him find other subsequences, he removes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, \ldots , a_{i_
    k}$</span> from the given sequence and finds another increasing
    subsequence using his greedy algorithm on the remaining
    sequence. He repeats this until he has used up all numbers from
    the original sequence.</p>
<p>But even this is starting to sound exhausting for Jimmy, so
    he asks you to help him by finding all of the sequences that
    would be formed by repeatedly applying the above greedy
    procedure and removing the resulting subsequence until the
    given sequence is empty.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5$</span>)
    indicating the length of the original sequence.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_ n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a_ i \leq
    10^9$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first line of output contains the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> of sequences that are produced.
    The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> lines contain
    the sequences, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th
    such line containing the increasing subsequence that is formed
    in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th application
    of the greedy algorithm.</p>
