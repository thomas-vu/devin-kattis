        Illustration of the two sample inputs. The coloured paths
        show where each friend goes in order to inspect every
        street at least once.
      </div>
</div>
<p>As the zombies start approaching your position, you and your
    surviving friends are devising a plan to evacuate to the next
    safe area. You know all the streets to the safe area, but donâ€™t
    yet know of any possible dangers along the way. Some of your
    friends volunteer to follow different streets to the safe area
    and report what they find. Time is short, so your friends will
    only move towards the safe area and never backtrack. How many
    friends do you need to send out at the same time such that they
    inspect all the streets to the safe area?</p>
<p>We can model the possible routes as a directed acyclic
    graph, where the set of vertices <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> represents junctions where streets
    can meet or merge and the set of directed edges <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> represents streets towards the
    safe area. We number the junctions such that every street
    strictly increases the junction number. Your friends each start
    at junction <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and end at
    the safe area <span class="tex2jax_process">$|V|-1$</span>.</p>
<p>Can you find the minimum number of friends you need to send
    towards the safe area so that every street gets inspected by at
    least one friend along the way?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq |V| \leq 100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$|V|-1 \leq |E| \leq {|V| \choose 2}$</span>.
    The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$|E|$</span> lines
    consist of two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a &lt; b &lt; |V|$</span> indicating
    that a street exists from junction <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. The streets come in lexicographic
    order, i.e. sorted by closer junction then further junction,
    and no two streets connect the same two junctions. Every
    junction and every street lies on some path from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$|V| - 1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the smallest number of friends you need to send
    towards the safe area in order to inspect all the streets.</p>
