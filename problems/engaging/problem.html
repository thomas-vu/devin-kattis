<div class="problembody">
<p>On the occasion of its <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>-year anniversary, an e-commerce
    company is running a campaign to engage with their loyal
    customers. They have prepared <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> gifts, numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, to thank its loyal customers
    where each customer will receive no more than one gift. The
    company has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> loyal
    customers, numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. In order to ensure that customers
    are satisfied with the gift they receive, the company decided
    to conduct a customer survey. The customer survey result is
    recorded by the feedback cards, each of which can be described
    by a tuple of three positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i,j,p)$</span> indicating that customer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> has a satisfaction
    level of <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> if he or she
    receives the gift <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.
    Each customer will give his or her level of satisfaction for
    every gift unless he/she has a satisfaction level of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. At the end, the
    company receives <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    feedback cards from their loyal customers.</p>
<p>Based on the result of the customer survey, your task is to
    determine how to send gifts to loyal customers to bring the
    greatest sum of satisfaction of all customers receiving the
    gifts.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq m,n \leq 1\, 000, \; 1 \leq k
        \leq m \times n)$</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines
        describe the customer survey results, each of which
        contains three positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$i, j, p$</span> described above
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq i \leq n, \; 1 \leq
        j \leq m, \; 1 \leq p \leq 30\, 000)$</span>. It is
        guaranteed that no <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
        surveys have same <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains an integer that is the greatest
        sum of satisfaction of all customers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> â€“ the number of gifts that
        must be sent to the customers;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> lines
        describe how the gifts are sent: each line contains two
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x,y$</span>
        indicating that the customer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> receives the gift <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are more than one solutions giving the greatest sum
    of satisfaction, you can print any of them.</p>
