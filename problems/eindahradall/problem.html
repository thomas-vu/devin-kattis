<p>A particle accelerator is being built in Iceland. The
    accelerator is <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> Planck
    lengths in length and is circular. An experiment is planned
    where two particles should collide. At the start, an electron
    is placed inside the circular accelerator and the magnets then
    start to accelerate it. It always moves an integer number of
    Planck lengths forward. As it is accelerating, it will at each
    step move further than in the last. In the first step, it moves
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> unit forward with
    probability half, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    units with probability a quarter, and so forth. Going forward
    if it moved <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> units in
    the previous step, it will move <span class="tex2jax_process">$k + 1$</span> units forward with probability
    half this time, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k + 2$</span>
    with probability a quarter, and so forth. When the particle
    moves <span class="tex2jax_process">$\geq N$</span> units in a
    single step the magnets cannot keep it contained anymore. Thus,
    we want the collision to happen at this exact moment, and for
    this the particle needs to be where it started. What is the
    probability of this occurring?</p>
<p>For example if <span class="tex2jax_process">$N = 7$</span>
    it could move two units forward, then three and finally six
    before it needs to collide. In this example it does not end up
    where it started, but many other sets of moves are possible. To
    better understand how often this repelling effect comes into
    play, we are interested in the probability that the particle is
    at the origin when the experiment ends. If the particle is at
    the origin it is equally likely to go left or right. If the
    particle moves <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> steps
    it is equally likely to take <span class="tex2jax_process">$k +
    1$</span> steps next or to take more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$k + 1$</span> steps next. Similarly, it is
    equally likely to take <span class="tex2jax_process">$k +
    2$</span> steps and to take more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$k + 2$</span> steps, so it half of the time
    it takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$k + 1$</span> steps, a
    quarter of the time it takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$k +
    2$</span> steps, and so forth.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq t \leq 100$</span>, the
    number of test cases. Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> lines follow, each representing a
    test case with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10^{18}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> in the
    input, print the probability for that <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> as explained above on its own
    line. The probability can be written as a reduced fraction
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span>. Since these numbers
    could be very large, you should instead print <span class="tex2jax_process">$pq^{-1}$</span> modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 007$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q^{-1}$</span> is the
    multiplicative inverse of <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 007$</span>.</p>
<p>For example, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$p=2$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q=4$</span>, then we find
    the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$q^{-1}$</span> such
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$q \cdot q^{-1} \equiv 1
    \pmod{1\, 000\, 000\, 007}$</span>. Since <span class="tex2jax_process">$4 \cdot 250\, 000\, 002 = 1\, 000\, 000\,
    008$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\,
    008 \equiv 1 \pmod{1\, 000\, 000\, 007}$</span>, we can compute
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$pq^{-1} \equiv 2 \cdot 250\,
    000\, 002 \equiv 500\, 000\, 004 \pmod{1\, 000\, 000\,
    007}$</span>.</p>
