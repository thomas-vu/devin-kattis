<p>You’re a cab driver, and you regularly take passengers
    downtown to go pick something up from a store. Often they ask
    you to wait for them, but it can be impossible to find parking.
    When you can’t find parking, you have to drive around the city,
    periodically coming back to where you dropped off your
    passenger, so that when they come back out of the store you can
    pick them up again. Unfortunately, the city is is full of
    one-way streets, and what’s more, it’s not always possible to
    get from any particular point in the city to any other point,
    because the one-way streets may not go between two different
    parts.</p>
<p>Because you can’t always get back to where you started, when
    you have to wait for a passenger by driving around the city you
    have to stay in the regions that allow you to come back to
    where you dropped him/her off. Therefore, your job is to make a
    list of the regions which you can stay in by driving around.
    You <em>don’t</em> need to worry about being able to get to a
    place initially.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of the description of a city. The description
    starts with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n \le 10\, 000$</span>. Following this
    are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
    containing a pair of store names <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$A \neq B$</span>. The pair <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> indicates that there is some way
    to drive from <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (in that direction).
    No pair of stores is listed more than once, but it is possible
    that a pair and its reverse may be listed. Every name is a
    sequence of between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> letters (a–z,
    A–Z).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print each group of two or more stores that can be visited
    together (indefinitely), one group per line. Start each group
    with the word ‘<tt class="ttfamily">okay</tt>’. List the stores
    within each group in lexicographic order. Order the groups
    lexicographically as well. Finally, if there are any stores
    where you should NOT drive to (you cannot visit them in
    conjunction with at least one other store indefinitely), list
    them of those on the last line (in lexicographic order). Start
    that list with the word ‘<tt class="ttfamily">avoid</tt>’.</p>
<p>The sample output indicates that you can drive forever
    between BahamaBucks and CVS, or between HEB and Starbucks, but
    if you are at OfficeDepot, you can’t go anywhere else and come
    back again.</p>
