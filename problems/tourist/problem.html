<div class="problembody">
<p>A lazy tourist wants to visit as many interesting locations
    in a city as possible without going one step further than
    necessary. Starting from his hotel, located in the north-west
    corner of city, he intends to take a walk to the south-east
    corner of the city and then walk back. When walking to the
    south-east corner, he will only walk east or south, and when
    walking back to the north-west corner, he will only walk north
    or west. After studying the city map he realizes that the task
    is not so simple because some areas are blocked. Therefore he
    has kindly asked you to write a program to solve his
    problem.</p>
<p>Given the city map (a 2D grid) where the interesting
    locations and blocked areas are marked, determine the maximum
    number of interesting locations he can visit. Locations visited
    twice are only counted once.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line in the input contains the number of test
    cases (at most 30). Then follow the cases. Each case starts
    with a line containing two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le W, H \le 100$</span>), the width and the height of the city
    map. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>
    lines, each containing a string with <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> characters with the following
    meaning:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">.</tt> Walkable area</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">*</tt> Interesting location (also
        walkable area)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">#</tt> Blocked area</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may assume that the upper-left corner (start and end
    point) and lower-right corner (turning point) are walkable, and
    that a walkable path of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$H
    + W - 2$</span> exists between them.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing a single
    integer: the maximum number of interesting locations the lazy
    tourist can visit.</p>
