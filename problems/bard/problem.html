<div class="problembody">
<p>Every evening villagers in a small village gather around a
    big fire and sing songs.</p>
<p>A prominent member of the community is the bard. Every
    evening, if the bard is present, he sings a brand new song that
    no villager has heard before, and no other song is sung that
    night. In the event that the bard is not present, other
    villagers sing without him and exchange all songs that they
    know.</p>
<p>Given the list of villagers present for <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> consecutive evenings, output all
    villagers that know all songs sung during that period.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 100$</span>, the number of villagers. The villagers
    are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. Villager number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is the bard.</p>
<p>The second line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq E \leq 50$</span>, the number of evenings.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> lines
    contain the list of villagers present on each of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> evenings. Each line
    begins with a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq K \leq N$</span>, the number of villagers present that
    evening, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    positive integers separated by spaces representing the
    villagers.</p>
<p>No villager will appear twice in one night and the bard will
    appear at least once across all nights.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output all villagers that know all songs, including the
    bard, one integer per line in ascending order.</p>
