<p>Per recently learned about <em>palindromes</em>. Now he
    wants to tell us about it and also has more awesome scientific
    news to share with us.</p>
<p>“A palindrome is a word that is the same no matter whether
    you read it backward or forward”, Per recently said in an
    interview. He continued: “For example, <em>add</em> is not a
    palindrome, because reading it backwards gives <em>dda</em> and
    it’s actually not the same thing, you see. However, if we
    reorder the letters of the word, we can actually get a
    palindrome. Hence, we say that <em>add</em> is a
    <em>Peragram</em>, because it is an anagram of a
    palindrome”.</p>
<p>Per gives us a more formal definition of <em>Peragrams</em>:
    “Like I said, if a word is an anagram of at least one
    palindrome, we call it a <em>Peragram</em>. And recall that an
    anagram of a word <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>
    contains exactly the same letters as <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, possibly in a different
    order.”</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Given a string, find the minimum number of letters you have
    to remove from it, so that the string becomes a Peragram.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a string on a single line. The string will
    contain at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>
    characters. The string will only contain lowercase letters
    <tt class="ttfamily">a-z</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output should consist of a single integer on a single line,
    the minimum number of characters that have to be removed from
    the string to make it a Peragram.</p>
