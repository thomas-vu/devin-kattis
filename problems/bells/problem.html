<p><em>Method ringing</em> is used to ring bells in churches,
    particularly in England. Suppose there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> bells that have <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> different pitches. We assign the
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to the bell
    highest in pitch, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> to
    the second highest, and so on. When the <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> bells are rung in some order—each
    of them exactly once—it is called a <em>row</em>. For example,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6, 3, 2, 4, 1, 5$</span> are two
    different rows.</p>
<p>An <em>ideal</em> performance contains all possible rows,
    each played exactly once. Unfortunately, the laws of physics
    place a limitation on any two consecutive rows; when a bell is
    rung, it has considerable inertia and the ringer has only a
    limited ability to accelerate or retard its cycle. Therefore,
    the position of each bell can change by at most one between two
    consecutive rows.</p>
<p>In Figure 1, you can see the pattern of a non-ideal
    performance, where bells only change position by at most
    one.</p>

<p>Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number
    of bells, output an ideal performance. All possible rows must
    be present exactly once, and the first row should be
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \dots , n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 8$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output an ideal sequence of rows, each on a separate line.
    The first line should contain the row <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \dots , n$</span> and each two
    consecutive lines should be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> step away from each other. Each
    row should occur exactly once in the output.</p>
