<div class="problembody">
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>-puzzle is a puzzle
    that goes by many names and has many variants. In this problem
    we will use the <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span>-puzzle. It consists of a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-by-<span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> grid of sliding squares where one
    square is missing. The squares are labeled with uppercase
    letters ’A’ through ’O’, with the desired layout as
    follows:</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img alt="\includegraphics{table}" src="/problems/npuzzle/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:; height:"/></p>
</div>
<p>It can be useful (for example, when solving the puzzle using
    a computer) to define the "scatter" of a puzzle as the sum of
    distances between each square’s current position and its
    position in the desired layout. The distance between two
    squares is their Manhattan distance (the sum of the absolute
    values of the differences between the two rows and the two
    columns).</p>
<p>Write a program that calculates the scatter of the given
    puzzle.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Four lines of input contain four characters each,
    representing the state of the puzzle.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the scatter of the puzzle on a single line.</p>
