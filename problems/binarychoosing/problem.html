<div class="problembody">
<p>Two years have passed, and Binary Town is having its next
    round of biennial elections.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000005"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> The “binary
    voting” system from last time confused a lot of people, so the
    citizens have decided to not vote at all this year and instead
    choose one citizen uniformly at random to become the town’s
    next mayor.</p>
<p>Because of a lack of trust from last time, though, Binary
    Town’s citizens have only found a single source of randomness
    that everyone agrees on: a single perfectly balanced coin that
    shows <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> on one side and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> on the other. The town
    council will repeatedly flip this coin where everyone can see
    it until they manage to find one random citizen to serve as the
    next mayor.</p>
<p>The exact process will go as follows: first, the town will
    conduct a census and assign every citizen a unique number from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$c - 1$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> equals the number of citizens.
    Next, the council will flip up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lceil \log _2 c \rceil $</span> coins and
    read the resulting bit string as a binary number. If they read
    a binary number at least as big as <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, then this doesn’t represent a
    valid citizen’s number and so they start again in a new round.
    Since the citizens have no time to waste, they will start a new
    round as soon as it becomes clear that their bit string
    corresponds to too big a number.</p>
<p>For example, if the census counts <span class="tex2jax_process">$c = 5$</span> citizens, they will flip up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lceil \log _2 5 \rceil =
    3$</span> coins to try to generate a binary number from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$000_2 = 0$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100_2 = 4 = c-1$</span>. If they
    get the binary number <span class="tex2jax_process">$101_2 =
    5$</span> they will have to restart, and if their bit string
    begins with two <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>’s in a
    row they will also immediately restart, since <span class="tex2jax_process">$110_2 = 6$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$111_2 = 7$</span> both exceed the highest
    number corresponding to a citizen.</p>
<p>Binary Town hasn’t conducted its census yet but would like
    to know how many expected coin flips they will have to make
    before choosing their new mayor. In the case of <span class="tex2jax_process">$c = 5$</span>, they have a <span class="tex2jax_process">$5/8$</span> chance of flipping <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> coins and choosing the new mayor
    without having to start a new round, a <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/8$</span> chance of flipping <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> coins and starting a new round (if
    they get the bit string <span class="tex2jax_process">$101$</span>), and a <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/4$</span> chance of flipping <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> coins and starting a new round
    early (if they get a bit string starting with <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>). The expected number of total
    coin flips then equals the expected number of coin flips in a
    single round (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \cdot 3/4 + 2
    \cdot 1/4 = 11/4 = 2.75$</span> expected coin flips in our
    example) times the expected number of rounds (this equals the
    inverse of the probability of successfully choosing a
    neighbour, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/(5/8) = 8/5 =
    1.6$</span> expected rounds in our example, making the total
    expected coin flips across all rounds <span class="tex2jax_process">$2.75 \cdot 1.6 = 4.4$</span>).<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000006"><sup class="footnotemark">2</sup></a></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq c \leq 10^9$</span> on a single line,
    the number of citizens (Binary Town really should conduct
    censuses more often given how much uncertainty they have about
    their population).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the expected number of coin flips needed to choose
    Binary Town’s next mayor as a real number. Answers will be
    accepted up to a relative or absolute error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span>. (If you submit answer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and the correct answer
    equals <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, the judge will
    accept your solution if <span class="tex2jax_process">$\min
    \left(\frac{|a-b|}{b}, |a-b|\right) \leq 10^{-3}$</span>.)</p>
