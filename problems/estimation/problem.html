<div class="problembody">
<p>“There are too many numbers here!” your boss bellows. “How
    am I supposed to make sense of all of this? Pare it down!
    Estimate!”</p>
<p>You are disappointed. It took a lot of work to generate
    those numbers. But, you’ll do what your boss asks.</p>
<p>You decide to estimate in the following way: You have an
    array <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> of numbers. You
    will partition it into <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    contiguous sections, which won’t necessarily be of the same
    size. Then, you’ll use a single number to estimate an entire
    section. In other words, for your array <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, you want to create another array
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, which has <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> contiguous sections. If
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> are in the same section, then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B[i]=B[j]$</span>. You want to
    minimize the error, expressed as the sum of the absolute values
    of the differences <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sum
    |A[i]-B[i]|$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There will be a single test case in the input. This test
    case will begin with two integers on a line, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 2\, 000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le k \le 25$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k \le
    n$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is
    the size of the array, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is the number of contiguous
    sections to use in estimation. The array <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> will be on the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, one integer per line. Each
    integer element of <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>
    will be in the range from <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\,
    000$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>,
    inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer on its own line, which is the
    minimum error you can achieve. All possible inputs yield
    answers which will fit in a signed 64-bit integer.</p>
