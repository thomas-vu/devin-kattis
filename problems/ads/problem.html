<div class="problembody">
<p>Web pages are littered with ads (advertisements) these days.
    You wrote a simple program to detect images which are ads and
    remove them.</p>
<p>Characters that are any of the following are allowed in
    images:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>alphanumeric characters</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>question mark ‘?’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>exclamation mark ‘!’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>comma ‘,’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>full stop ‘.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whitespace ‘ ’</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Any images contained characters that are not allowed are
    considered ads, and will be removed by your program. The
    ‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$+$</span>’ character will be
    used only as the border of an image.</p>
<p>All images will follow these rules:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>They are all axis-aligned rectangles with ‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$+$</span>’ as its border and is at least
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 x 3$</span> big (including
        the borders).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All ‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$+$</span>’
        characters belong to the border of exactly 1 image.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Borders of different images will not be adjacent to each
        other (contact at their corners is also not allowed).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They can contain other images while adhering to the
        rules above.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For every banned character that is found inside at least
        one image, in order not to remove too many unnecessary
        parts of the images on the web page, you decide that the
        smallest image (in terms of pixel count) that contains that
        character will be flagged as an ad and removed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When an ad is removed, every character inside the ad and
        the border is replaced with a whitespace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the web page is not considered an image.
    Characters found on the web page that is not in any image
    should not be removed.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq H \leq 200$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq W \leq 200$</span>, the height and
    width of the web page to be processed respectively.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> lines follow, each
    line contain exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>
    ASCII characters whose ASCII decimal value fall in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[32, 126]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the web page with all the ads removed. Do not print
    extra spaces or new lines.</p>
<h2>Subtasks</h2>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">(21 Points)</b>: There is no ads in
        the web page at all.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">(21 Points)</b>: There is either one
        image or no image in the web page.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">(28 Points)</b>: No images will be
        found inside other images.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">(30 Points)</b>: No additional
        constraint.</p>
</li>
