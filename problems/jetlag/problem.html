<div class="problembody">
<p>The ICPC World Finals are here and they are packed full of
    activities you want to attend — speeches, presentations, fun
    events, not to mention the contest itself. There is only one
    problem: when are you going to sleep?</p>
<p>When you fall asleep, you always set a timer because
    otherwise you would be able to sleep forever. Using the timer,
    you can choose to sleep for any positive integer amount of
    minutes. After sleeping for <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> minutes, you will be rested for
    another <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> minutes (and
    so you will not be able to fall asleep again); and then you
    will be able to function for a third <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> minutes (so you can stay awake,
    but you can also go to sleep if you want to).</p>
<p>You know the times of all the activities at the Finals; you
    should plan your sleep schedule to not miss any part of any
    event. Just before the Finals start (at minute <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>), you will arrive in your hotel
    room after a long journey and you will need to sleep
    immediately.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n \leq 200\, 000$</span>), the number
    of activities planned for the Finals.</p>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> of
    the remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    contains two positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i &lt; e_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_ i \le b_{i+1}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le b_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_ n \leq 10^{10}$</span>), the beginning
    and end time of the activity, counted in minutes from the
    beginning of the Finals.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is possible to find a sleep schedule that allows you
    to participate in all planned activities in their entirety,
    then output such a schedule in the format described below.
    Otherwise, output <tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>.</p>
<p>A sleep schedule is specified by a line containing the
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le p \le 10^6$</span>) of sleep periods,
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> lines. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> of these
    lines contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> — the
    beginning and end time of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> sleep period, counted
    in minutes from the beginning of the Finals. Note that you
    should not output any sleep period after the last activity.</p>
<p>The sleep periods must satisfy <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 = s_1 &lt; t_1 &lt; s_2 &lt; t_2 &lt;
    \ldots &lt; t_ p \leq b_ n$</span> as well as the condition
    described in the statement that does not allow you to fall
    asleep for some time after a sleep period. You may fall asleep
    immediately after an activity (so it may be that <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i=e_ j$</span>) and you may wake up just
    before an activity (so it may be that <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i=b_ j$</span>).</p>
<p>If there are multiple valid sleep schedules, any one will be
    accepted. It can be shown that if there is a valid sleep
    schedule, then there is also one with at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span> sleep periods.</p>
