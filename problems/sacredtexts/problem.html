<p>You are a respected dwarven archaeologist. Your job consists
    of scouring ruins and reading ancient texts.</p>
<p>Recently while under an expedition your team had uncovered
    sacred texts you believe belong to the Great Circles.</p>
<p>Each dwarven rune consists of one or more characters. These
    characters are in the ASCII decimal range of <span class="tex2jax_process">$33$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$47$</span>: <tt>!"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./</tt>
    with values in increasing order. So <tt>!</tt> has a value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> as it’s the first,
    <tt>"</tt> has a value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> because it’s the second, etc.
    According to your studies, adjacent characters in the same rune
    add their values together.</p>
<p>Runes are separated by spaces. In the dwarven language a
    <tt>0</tt> indicates a space, while a <tt>&lt;</tt> and
    <tt>&gt;</tt> represent commas and periods respectively; these
    special runes will always consist of a single character. All
    other runes correspond to lowercase English letters. The
    ancient dwarves used the same ordering of letters as the modern
    alphabet, but as a Great Circle with no beginning nor
    ending.</p>
<p>Be warned however, that the year that a text is written
    impacts its translation. The rune <tt>!*&amp;()</tt> in 1389
    would not translate to the same letter as it would in 1689 due
    to unpredictable rotations in the Great Circle. You need to
    correct for this somehow.</p>
<p>Luckily your team has plenty of samples in the library that
    they can use as a reference to decode the text.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>Input starts with a line consisting of a single rune,
    followed (space-separated) by its translated lowercase English
    letter.</p>
<p>Then up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> lines of
    dwarven text follow, each consisting of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>Output the translated texts.</p>
