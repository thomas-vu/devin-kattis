<p>Dr. Thanos, data scientist and self-described nihilist,
    recently published a paper titled <i class="itshape">The
    snapping point of the universe: why rates of population growth
    point towards imminent destruction</i>. In his paper, Thanos
    explains that in many planets, the increasing population count
    is leading to a diminished quality of life. He is convinced
    that his findings will drive sweeping reforms in intergalactic
    law, leading to a better life for all organisms.<br/></p>
<p>Thanos turns to you, his confidant, to do some
    investigation. He would like some concrete evidence for his
    findings to present to the Association of VENGE’s Research
    Society. The society, one of the galatic leaders in
    egalitarianism and social justice, is holding a special panel
    to discuss Thano’s findings. As this involves the chance of
    actual legislation being passed, Thanos is convinced that the
    panelists are going to be a tough sell. He asks you to
    investigate several datasets and see if they could be
    potentially helpful in supporting his argument.<br/></p>
<p>Thanos hands you the data for several planets. On each
    planet’s file, you read that: the planet currently has a
    population of <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, its
    population grows by a factor of <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> times per year, and its annual
    food production <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> in
    tons. All food produced in a year must be consumed that year;
    it cannot be saved. Assume that each individual consumes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> ton of food per year,
    and that the population for each planet each year is always
    counted as a whole number, rounded down. Given this
    information, your task is to find out the number of years a
    planet has remaining before its population is no longer
    sustainable by its food production.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 2\, 000$</span>), the number
    of planets that need to be analyzed.<br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines follow, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th of which consists of
    three space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq P \leq 10^9$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    &lt; R \leq 10^9$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq F \leq 10^9$</span>), the metrics of planet <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> as described above.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th of which should
    consist of a single integer denoting the number of years the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th planet has before it
    is no longer sustainable.<br/></p>
