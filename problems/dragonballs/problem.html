        Dragon Balls</a> by Skyringe Crafts
      </div>
</div>During the showdown with Frieza on Namek, Krillin died
    yet again and needs to be brought back to life using the
    <em>Dragon Balls</em>. As everybody else is still busy fighting
    Frieza, the task of retrieving all seven Dragon Balls has
    fallen to you.
    <p>The balls are hidden at unknown locations in a 2D plane and
    you have been handed a Dragon Radar, designed by Bulma, that
    you must use to locate them. You can repeatedly fly to
    arbitrary locations, and the radar will then inform you about
    the distance to the closest Dragon Ball. If this distance is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> this means that you
    found one of the balls and you can then recalibrate the radar
    so that it ignores the ball you just found.</p>
<p>With the battle still going on, and the radar having limited
    energy, you are obviously in a great hurry. You need to make
    sure to collect all the balls by using the radar no more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> times.</p>
<h2>Interaction</h2>
<p>This is an interactive problem. Your submission will be run
    against an <em>interactor</em>, which reads the standard output
    of your submission and writes to the standard input of your
    submission. This interaction needs to follow a specific
    protocol:</p>
<p>The interactor first sends an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 7$</span>), the number of Dragon Balls you still need
    to find. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> balls are
    hidden at integer locations <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x,y \le 10^6$</span>. Your submission
    may not guess outside this area.</p>
<p>Your submission then repeatedly sends such an integer
    location <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> and the
    interactor replies with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le d \le 2\cdot 10^{12}$</span>), the square of the distance
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> to the
    closest remaining ball.</p>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$d = 0$</span>, the ball at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> is considered
    found and ignored in further guesses. When all balls are found,
    your submission should exit. Each location holds at most one
    ball.</p>
<p>Make sure you flush the buffer after each write.</p>
<p>A testing tool is provided to help you develop your
    solution.</p>
