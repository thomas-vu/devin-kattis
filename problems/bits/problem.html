<p>As we all know, it takes more energy to store binary numbers
    with lots of ones in them. Yraglac’s calculator has some
    batteries that are almost dead, and he’s concerned that the
    battery may run out as he types in a number.</p>
<p>The way the calculator processes numbers being entered is as
    follows. Initially, the calculator stores the number zero in a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span>-bit internal
    register. As Yraglac types in each digit of his number, the
    register updates to store the number entered thus far. For
    example, when Yraglac enters the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$94$</span>, the register stores the number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> (binary <span class="tex2jax_process">$1001$</span>) after the first key is
    pressed. When he presses the second key, the register clears
    itself and stores the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$94$</span> (binary <span class="tex2jax_process">$1011110$</span>). What is the maximum number
    of one-bits in the register as Yraglac enters a number
    digit-by-digit?</p>
<p>To convert an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> to a binary string, you can use
    <tt class="ttfamily">Integer.toBinaryString(x)</tt> in Java and
    <tt class="ttfamily">bin(x)</tt> in Python. See the language
    documentation for more information.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 1\, 000$</span> giving the number of
    test cases. Each test case consists of a line with a single
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq X &lt; 2^{31}$</span>), the number
    Yraglac wants to enter.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the
    maximum number of one-bits in the storage register as the
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is entered,
    digit by digit.</p>
