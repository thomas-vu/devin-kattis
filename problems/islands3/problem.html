<div class="problembody">
<p>You are mapping a faraway planet using a satellite. The
    planet’s surface can be modeled as a grid. The satellite has
    captured an image of the surface. Each grid square is either
    land (denoted as ‘<tt class="ttfamily">L</tt>’), water (denoted
    as ‘<tt class="ttfamily">W</tt>’), or covered by clouds
    (denoted as ‘<tt class="ttfamily">C</tt>’). Clouds mean that
    the surface could either be land or water; you cannot tell.</p>
<p>An island is a region of land where every grid cell in the
    island is connected to every other by some path, and every leg
    of the path only goes up, down, left or right.</p>
<p>Given an image, determine the minimum number of islands that
    is consistent with the given image.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that
    your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The
    first line of input contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le r, c \le 50$</span>), which are the number of rows and the
    number of columns of the image. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines will each contain exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> characters, consisting
    only of ‘<tt class="ttfamily">L</tt>’ (representing
    <em>Land</em>), ‘<tt class="ttfamily">W</tt>’ (representing
    <em>Water</em>), and ‘<tt class="ttfamily">C</tt>’
    (representing <em>Clouds</em>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the minimum number of
    islands possible.</p>
