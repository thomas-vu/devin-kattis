<p>Pixels in a digital picture can be represented with three
    integers in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$255$</span> that indicate the
    intensity of the red, green, and blue colors. To compress an
    image or to create an artistic effect, many photo-editing tools
    include a “posterize” operation which works as follows. Each
    color channel is examined separately; this problem focuses only
    on the red channel. Rather than allow all integers from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$255$</span> for the red channel, a
    posterized image allows at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> integers from this range. Each
    pixel’s original red intensity is replaced with the nearest of
    the allowed integers. The photo-editing tool selects a set of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> integers that
    minimizes the <em>sum of the squared errors</em> introduced
    across all pixels in the original image. If there are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> pixels that have
    original red values <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_1, \ldots
    , r_ n$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    allowed integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_1, \ldots ,
    v_ k$</span>, the sum of squared errors is defined
    as</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \sum _{i=1}^ n \min _{1
    \leq j \leq k} (r_ i - v_ j)^2. \]</span>
<p>Your task is to compute the minimum achievable sum of
    squared errors, given parameter <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> and a description of the red
    intensities of an image’s pixels.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d \leq 256$</span>), the number of
    distinct red values that occur in the original image, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq d$</span>), the number of
    distinct red values allowed in the posterized image. The
    remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> lines
    indicate the number of pixels of the image having various red
    values. Each such line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq r \leq 255$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq p \leq 2^{26}$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is a red intensity value and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is the number of
    pixels having red intensity <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>. Those <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> lines are given in increasing
    order of red value.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the sum of the squared errors for an optimally
    chosen set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> allowed
    integer values.</p>
