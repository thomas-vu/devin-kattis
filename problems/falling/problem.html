<p>Susan is making high-speed videos of falling coffee mugs.
    When analyzing the videos she wants to know how big the mugs
    are, but unfortunately they all got destroyed during filming.
    Susan knows some physics though, so she has figured out how far
    they moved between different video frames. The camera was
    filming at a speed of <span class="tex2jax_process">$70$</span>
    frames per second, which means that at frame <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, counted from when the mug was
    released, the number of millimeters it has moved is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d=n^2$</span>. The counting of
    the frames starts at <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<p>Susan thinks a certain mug is <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> millimeters high, but to verify
    this she needs to find two frames between which the mug has
    moved exactly this distance. Can you help her do this?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input file contains the single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D\leq 200\, 000$</span>, the
    distance to be measured.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two non-negative integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_2$</span>, the numbers of the frames that
    Susan should compare. They should fulfill <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_2^2-n_1^2=D$</span>. If no two such
    integers exist, instead output “<tt>impossible</tt>”.</p>
