<p>You are head of operations at FlixNet, and you are
    responsible for transmitting just the title of movies to
    consumers. All movie titles on FlixNet are a single word and
    consist only of alphabetic characters.</p>
<p>The aggregate cost for transmitting a particular title is
    just equal to the number of letters in that title, except that
    your interweb service preventer has agreed to cap that cost at
    a given (floating point) value.</p>
<p>Given the title of a movie and the value of that cap,
    calculate your cost to transmit that movie title to your
    consumers.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a single line containing the name of the movie
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and the cap on the
    cost <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>. The name of the
    movie will contain between 1 and 30 characters, inclusive, and
    consist solely of uppercase or lowercase letters. The cost will
    be a floating point value with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le c\le 100$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single floating point value, which is the minimum
    of the length of the title and the cap on the cost. Your
    solution will be judged correct if it is within 1e-8 absolute
    or relative error of the correct answer.</p>
