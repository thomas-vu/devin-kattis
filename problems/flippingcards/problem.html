</div>Mike and his young daughter Jesse are playing a new card
    game meant for kids. The rules are quite simple, each player is
    dealt a hand of cards. Each card has one picture on each side.
    They take turns playing cards and the first one to run out of
    cards is the winner.

    <p>A player’s turn consists of picking a subset of cards from
    their hand and laying them on the table. The only rule is that
    the cards must be placed on the table such that no two cards
    are showing the same picture.</p>
<p>Mike thought this was a very appropriate game to play with
    his kid because of the simple rules. Mike also liked this game
    because finding the best strategy is an algorithmically
    interesting challenge!</p>
<p>Help Mike determine if he can play his entire hand on his
    first round.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single positive
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 10$</span>) indicating the number of
    test cases. Each test case begins with a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> denoting the number of
    cards in Mike’s hand. Here <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 50\, 000$</span>. Following this are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each describing a card in
    Mike’s hand.</p>
<p>The pictures on the cards are represented by integers. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th card is given by two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i, q_ i$</span>
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p_ i, q_ i \leq
    2n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case you should output a single line with the
    word <tt class="ttfamily">possible</tt> if it is possible for
    Mike to play his entire hand in one turn, or <tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt> if Mike cannot play his entire hand
    in one turn.</p>
