<div class="problembody">
<p>The Vowels are <b class="bfseries">a</b>, <b class="bfseries">e</b>, <b class="bfseries">i</b>, <b class="bfseries">o</b> and <b class="bfseries">u</b>, and possibly
    <b class="bfseries">y</b>. People disagree on whether <b class="bfseries">y</b> is a vowel or not. Unfortunately for you, you
    have been tasked with counting the number of vowels in a word.
    Youâ€™ll have to count how many vowels there are assuming
    <b class="bfseries">y</b> is a vowel, and assuming <b class="bfseries">y</b> is not.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The single line of input contains a string of at least one
    and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> lowercase
    letters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two space-separated integers. The first is the number
    of vowels assuming <b class="bfseries">y</b> is not a vowel,
    the second is the number of vowels assuming <b class="bfseries">y</b> is a vowel.</p>
