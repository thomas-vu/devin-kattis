<div class="problembody">
<p>You are organising a programming competition in which the
    rank of a team is first determined by how many problems they
    have solved. In case of a tie, the team with the lowest time
    penalty is ranked above the other. However, contrary to the
    UKIEPC, the time penalty is equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> if the <i class="itshape">latest</i> accepted submission was submitted in the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>th minute, or
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> if no problem was
    solved.</p>
<p>For example, if team A solved their first problem in the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>th minute, their second
    problem in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>th
    minute and their third problem in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span>th minute, then their time penalty
    is <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span>. If team B also
    solved three problems, in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span>th, <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span>th and <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>th minute, their time penalty is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> and they would rank
    above team A.</p>
<p>The contest has finished and you would like to enter the
    final standings. However, due to a corrupted file you have lost
    part of the scoreboard. In particular, the column indicating
    how many problems each team has solved is gone. You do still
    have the time penalties of all the teams and know that they are
    in the right order. You also remember how many problems the
    contest had. You wonder whether, given this information, it is
    possible to uniquely reconstruct the number of problems that
    each team has solved.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing two integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 10^4$</span>), the number of
        teams participating, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le p \le 10^4$</span>), the number of
        contest problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines with on
        line <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> the time
        score <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> in
        minutes (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le t_ i \le
        10^6$</span>) of the team that is ranked in the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A positive time score of <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> indicates that a team has
    submitted their last accepted submission in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>th minute. A time score of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> indicates that a team
    hasn’t solved any problem.</p>
<p>The input always originates from a valid scoreboard.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is possible to uniquely reconstruct the scores of all
    the teams, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines containing the number of problems that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th team has solved on the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th line. Otherwise,
    output “<tt class="ttfamily">ambiguous</tt>”.</p>
