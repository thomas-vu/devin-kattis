<p>Mr. Krabs is a hardcore cryptocurrency and blockchain
    technology enthusiast. In a recent conference, he heard about a
    new cryptocurrency called <em>ByteConn333ct</em>, which
    promises a very high rate of return. He wants to invest in this
    cryptocurrency, but its unique conversion rate to Canadian
    dollars makes him a bit apprehensive.</p>
<p>Several steps are need to compute the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> <em>ByteConn333ct</em> dollars
    (guaranteed to be an integer) in Canadian dollars. First, treat
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> as a string consisting
    of only digits. Next, define a subset <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> of characters from <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> “valid” iff the characters in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> can be concatenated
    together in some way to form a number with no leading zeros
    that is also divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. Finally, the converted value in
    Canadian dollars is the number of “valid” subsets modulo
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9 + 7$</span>.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Krabs is already so rich from his successful fast
    food restaurant business, he has decided to dump all of his
    life’s saving into investing <em>ByteConn333ct</em>. Mr. Krabs
    can’t wait to find out what amazing returns he will get, so he
    has hire you to compute the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> <em>ByteConn333ct</em> dollars in
    Canadian dollars so that he celebrate in advance this amazing
    investment he has made.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N\leq 200\, 000$</span>.
    The second line of the input contains a single <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>-digit non-negative integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> without leading
    zeros.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>
<em>ByteConn333ct</em> dollars in Canadian dollars (i.e. the
    number of valid subsets of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9 + 7$</span>).</p>
