<p>Brandon is learning the periodic table! However, he doesnâ€™t
    like some of the elements because the symbol of the element
    contains letters which are not present in the name of the
    element. He finds this to be unintuitive, especially because in
    other contexts, he expects abbreviations to not introduce
    random letters.</p>
<p>Given a string and a proposed abbreviation, determine if
    Brandon would find it intuitive. Brandon finds an abbreviation
    intuitive if and only if every letter that appears in the
    abbreviation appears in the original string. Brandon does not
    look at the abbreviation carefully, so it is acceptable for a
    letter to appear more times in the abbreviation than in the
    original string, or for the letters to appear in a different
    order between the string and the abbreviation.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq t \leq 10^3$</span>). This is the
    number of test cases.</p>
<p>Each test case is represented on two lines.</p>
<p>The first line of each test case contains a single string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> of length at least two
    and at most 50. This string only contains lowercase letters.
    The second line of the test case contains a single string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> that is strictly
    shorter than <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and also
    only contains lowercase letters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> lines, one
    for each test case.</p>
<p>For each test case, if all the letters in <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> appear in <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, output <tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt>. Otherwise, output <tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt>.</p>
