<p>When you are designing a complicated document, page layout
    is important. Newspapers and magazines don’t just put a whole
    bunch of text that covers the page left-to-right, listing one
    article after another. They put multiple articles on a page, at
    different positions designed to maximize visual impact. The
    problem is that each story has a certain size and preferred
    (fixed) location, and you can’t fit all the stories on a single
    page (and stories can’t overlap). What you would like to do is
    maximize the amount of space you can fill with the stories you
    have on a single page. Then later, you’ll fill in the remaining
    space with pictures or advertising.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span> test cases. Each test case
    begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n
    \leq 20$</span>, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> story descriptions. Each story
    description consists of four integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>. These represent the width,
    height, x-position, and y-position of the story. Each story has
    the shape of a rectangle, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> is the location of the
    top-left corner. Every story will fit within the bounds of the
    rectangle defined by the corners <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0,0]$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1000,1000]$</span>. The last test case is
    followed by a single zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the maximum area of the page that
    can be covered by the given stories. Two stories are considered
    overlapping if the area of their intersection is non-zero. In
    other words, stories may <em>just</em> touch each other by
    sharing an edge or a corner.</p>
