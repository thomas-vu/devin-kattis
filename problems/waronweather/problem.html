<p>After an unprovoked hurricane attack on the south shore,
    Glorious Warrior has declared war on weather. The first salvo
    in this campaign will be a coordinated pre-emptive attack on as
    many tropical depressions as possible. GW reckons that the
    attack will neutralize the tropical depressions before they
    become storms, and dissuade others from forming.</p>
<p>GW has at his disposal <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> space-to-earth killer satellites
    at various locations in space. <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> tropical depressions are known to
    exist at various locations on the earthâ€™s surface. Each
    satellite can attack any number of targets on the earth
    provided there is line of sight between the satellite and each
    target. How many different targets can be hit?</p>
<p>The input consists of several test cases. Each case begins
    with a line containing integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; k, m \leq 100$</span> as defined
    above. <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines follow,
    each giving <span class="tex2jax_process">$x,y,z$</span> - the
    location in space of a satellite at the scheduled time of
    attack. <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines then
    follow, each giving <span class="tex2jax_process">$x,y,z$</span> - the location of a target
    tropical depression. Assume the earth is a sphere centred at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0,0)$</span> with
    circumference 40,000 km. All targets will be on the surface of
    the earth (within <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-8}$</span> km) and all satellites will
    be at least 50 km above the surface. A line containing 0 0
    follows the last test case.</p>
<p>For each test case, output a line giving the total number of
    targets that can be hit. If a particular target falls within
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-8}$</span> km of the
    boundary between being within line-of-sight and not, it may be
    counted either way. (That is, you need not consider rounding
    error so long as it does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-8}$</span> km.)</p>
