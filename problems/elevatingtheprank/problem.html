<div class="problembody">
<p>After Loke beat you in last weekâ€™s programming competition
    you want play a prank on him. You both live in the same student
    apartment and in order to get from floor <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> to floor <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, Loke (who is very lazy) of course
    wants to take the elevator. You want him to suffer as long as
    possible inside the elevator and therefore you have pressed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> different floors that
    the elevator should stop at.</p>
<p>The elevator stops for <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> seconds on each floor that it
    stops on. Opening and closing the elevator doors is instant. It
    takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> seconds for the
    elevator to move from one floor to another.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10 \leq A, B \leq 50$</span>), the origin
    and destination floors for Loke. The next line of input
    contains one integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq N \leq 60$</span>), the
    number of floors you have pressed. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each contain one integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10 \leq a_ i \leq 50$</span>), the floors
    the elevator will stop at.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print one integer, the number of seconds Loke has to suffer
    <i class="itshape">inside</i> the elevator, from the doors
    closing on floor <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> to
    the doors opening on floor <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample 2</h2>
<p>The elevator will move <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> floors in total, from floor
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to floor <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>. This takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span> seconds. Among the floors that
    you have pressed for the elevator to stop, only floor
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> is between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>. The time for the doors to open
    and close on floor <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> is zero, so it does
    not affect the answer. In total, Loke will spend <span class="tex2jax_process">$42$</span> seconds inside the elevator.</p>
