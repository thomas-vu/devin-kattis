<p>That went well! As police sirens rang out around the palace,
    Mal Reynolds had already reached his lifting device outside of
    the city.</p>
<p>No spaceship can escape Planet Zarzos without permission
    from the High Priest. However, Mal’s spaceship, Firefly, is in
    geostationary orbit well above the controlled zone and his
    small lifting device can avoid being recognised as an intruder
    if its vertical velocity is exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> km/min.</p>
<p>There are still two problems. First, Mal will not be able to
    control the vehicle from his space suit, so he must set up the
    autopilot while on the ground. The vertical velocity must be
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> km/min and the
    horizontal velocity must be set in such a way that Mal will hit
    the Firefly on the resulting trajectory. Second, the energy
    shields of the planet disturb the autopilot: They will decrease
    or increase the horizontal velocity by a given factor. The
    original horizontal velocity is restored as soon as there is no
    interference. For this problem we consider Firefly to be a
    single point – the shape shown in Figure 1 is merely for
    decorative purposes.</p>

<p>Luckily, Mal recorded the positions of the shields and their
    influence on the autopilot during his descent. What he needs
    now is a program telling him the right horizontal velocity
    setting.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^7 \le x \le 10^7$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$|x| \le y \le 10^8$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le y$</span>),
        Firefly’s coordinates relatively to Mal’s current position
        (in kilometres).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n\le 100$</span>), the number of
        shields.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
        describing the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        shields, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th
        line containing three numbers:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_
            i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le l_ i
            &lt; y$</span>), the lower boundary of shield
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (in
            kilometres).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_
            i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$l_ i &lt; u_
            i \le y$</span>), the upper boundary of shield
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (in
            kilometres).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a real value <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_
            i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0.1 \le f_ i
            \le 10.0$</span>), the factor with which the horizontal
            velocity is multiplied during the traversal of shield
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is guaranteed that shield ranges do not intersect,
        i.e., for every pair of shields <span class="tex2jax_process">$i \ne j$</span> either <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_ i\le l_ j$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_ j\le l_ i$</span> must hold.</p>
<p>All real numbers will have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> digits after the decimal
        point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the horizontal velocity in km/min which Mal must
    choose in order to reach Firefly. The output must be accurate
    to an absolute or relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
