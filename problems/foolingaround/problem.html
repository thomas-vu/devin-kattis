<div class="problembody">
<p>Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice going
    first. They begin with a pile of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> stones, each turn removing one
    less than a prime number of stones. The person who removes the
    last stone wins. Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, determine who wins the the game,
    assuming Alice and Bob both play optimally.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of a integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>, the number of testcases, with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq Q \leq 100$</span>. The
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines each
    contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, representing the number of stones
    in the pile, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq
    10^9$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the winner “<tt class="ttfamily">Alice</tt>” or “<tt class="ttfamily">Bob</tt>”. Each
    testcase’s output should be printed on their own line.</p>
