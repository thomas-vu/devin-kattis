<p>You are an avid cyclist and bike every day between your home
    and school. Usually, your ride is uneventful and you bike along
    the shortest path between home and school. After school this
    afternoon you realized you have a slow leak in your bike
    tire—the tire can hold some air, but not for long. Refilling
    the tire allows you to ride your bike for some distance, after
    which your tire goes flat again and it becomes impossible to
    ride any further (and you refuse to walk your bicycle).</p>
<p>Luckily for you, your city has installed several bike repair
    stations at intersections throughout town where you can refill
    your tire and bike again until the tire goes flat. There’s a
    repair station at your school too, so that you can fill up your
    tire before you start on your trip home.</p>
<p>You’ve calculated how far you can bike before your tire runs
    out of air and you know the layout of your town, including all
    the intersections, distances between them, and the locations of
    the repair stations. What is the shortest possible trip from
    school to your home that you can take without becoming stuck
    due to a flat tire? (You do not become stuck if you roll into a
    repair station, or your home, at the exact same time as your
    tire goes flat.)</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le n \le 500$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; m \le n(n-1)/2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; t &lt; n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; d &lt; 2^{31}$</span>. The value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> represents the number
    of intersections in the city, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> represents the number of roads in
    the city, <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> is the
    number of repair stations and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is the distance that you can bike
    (starting with a fully inflated tire) before your tire goes
    flat again. The intersections are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Your school is at intersection
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and your home is at
    intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> integers, with values between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>, inclusive. These are the
    intersections where the repair stations are located (excluding
    your school’s repair station). All integers on this line are
    unique.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
    represent the roads in your town. Each has three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i, j, k$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i &lt; j \le n$</span>,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; k &lt;
    2^{31}$</span>. These three integers represent that there is a
    direct road from intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>. Roads can be traveled in either
    direction. There is at most one road between any two
    intersections.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the minimum total distance you need to travel to reach
    home from school without getting stuck due to a flat tire. If
    the trip is not possible, output the word <tt class="ttfamily">stuck</tt> on a single line instead.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that if the trip is possible, the minimum
    distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> satisfies
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; D &lt;
    2^{31}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Sample Explanation</h2>
<p>In the first sample input, if your tire did not have a leak
    then the shortest path home would have a distance of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, going from the school
    through intersections <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>. However, due to
    the leak, you can only travel a distance of <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> before you need to refill the
    tire, requiring you to use the repair stations at intersections
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, for a total distance of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>.</p>
<p>In the second sample input, if your tire did not have a
    leak, then the shortest path home would have a distance of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>. But since your tire
    only lasts for a distance of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, there’s no path where your bike
    tire will not go flat somewhere along the way. Even when using
    repair station at intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, you get stuck before you can
    reach either your home or the repair station at intersection
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>.</p>
