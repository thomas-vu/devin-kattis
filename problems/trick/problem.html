</div>Lukas is to hold a presentation on useful mathematical
    tricks. E.g., to take the square root of a number you just need
    to remove the first half of the number. To convince his
    audience he uses the well tested method of proof by example:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sqrt {25} = 5$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sqrt {5776} = 76$</span> so the
    method obviously works. To multiply a number by <span class="tex2jax_process">$X = 2.6$</span> all you have to do is move
    the first digit to the end of the number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$135\times 2.6 = 351$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$270270\times 2.6 = 702702$</span>.

    <p>Lukas wants to demonstrate that this last method works for
    any <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>. To do this he
    will ask his audience for values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and then show them example
    multiplications for which the method works. Lukas has noticed
    that he can not just pick arbitrary numbers for his examples,
    so now he wants your help. Can you write a program that given
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> gives a list of
    integers for which multiplying by <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is equivalent to moving the first
    digit to the end of the number? Lukas does not like very large
    numbers so do not list any numbers with more than 8 digits.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a single decimal number <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq X &lt; 1000$</span>) with at most 4
    digits after the decimal point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a list of all positive integers less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^8$</span> for which Lukas’
    second trick works. Write the numbers in ascending order, one
    number per line. If the list is empty, output instead
    “<tt class="ttfamily">No solution</tt>”.</p>
