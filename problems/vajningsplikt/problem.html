        The situation in Sample <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>A startup company tries to develop software for self-driving
    cars. One of the surprisingly difficult problems turns out to
    be right-of-way at an intersection. The local traffic
    regulations prescribe that your vehicle must yield the
    right-of-way if one of the following two conditions is
    satisfied:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>You want to pass straight through the intersection;
        another vehicle is approaching from your right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You want to turn left at the intersection; another
        vehicle is approaching from the opposite direction or from
        your right.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Note that it is not important in which direction the other
    vehicle wants to <em>leave</em> the intersection.</p>
<p>Write a program that decides if your car should yield the
    right-of-way to the other vehicle.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Three strings <span class="tex2jax_process">$a,b,c \in \{
    \text {North},\text {South},\text {East},\text {West}\}
    $</span>, corresponding to the direction from which you arrive,
    the direction in which you want to leave, and the direction
    from which the other vehicle approaches. You can assume
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a \neq b$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a \neq c$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single line with the string “Yes” or “No” as explained
    above.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span></h2>
<p>In this example, you arrive from South and want to turn left
    to leave towards West. The other vehicle comes from East, which
    corresponds to your right. Consequently, you have to yield the
    right-of-way to the other vehicle because of condition
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.</p>
