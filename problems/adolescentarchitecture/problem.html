<p>Little Peter is building a stack out of his toy blocks. He
    is using two kinds of blocks – cubes and cylinders – and wants
    to stack all of them into a single tower, where each block
    other than the topmost block has a single block standing on it.
    In order for the tower to be stable, the outline of each block
    needs to be fully contained within the outline of the block
    below when looking at the tower from above (the outlines are
    allowed to touch). Is it possible to construct such a tower,
    and if so, in which order do the blocks need to be stacked?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100$</span>), the number of
        blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        with the description of a block. The description consists
        of a string giving the type of block (<tt class="ttfamily">cube</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">cylinder</tt>)
        and an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a \le 1\,
        000$</span>) giving the size of the block – if the block is
        a cube then <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is its
        side length, and if it is a cylinder then <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is the radius of its base
        (note that the height of the cylinder does not matter).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If there is no way to construct the tower, output <tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>. Otherwise output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, giving the order in which
    to stack the blocks from top to bottom.</p>
