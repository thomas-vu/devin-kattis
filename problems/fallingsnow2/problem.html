        Kaguya in the snow
      </div>
</div>
<p>Princess Kaguya is running through the snowy mountains!
    However, since it has been snowing quite hard, the terrain is
    very rough, and thus she would like to plan around it.</p>
<p>Kaguya has created a mental image of what the snow was like
    some time ago, which may include snow suspended in the air.
    More formally, she envisions a grid of dimension <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, where the symbol ‘S’ represents
    snow and periods represent nothingness.</p>
<p>All snow will fall directly downwards in the grid at the
    same speed, until it hits another piece of snow or the bottom
    of the grid, and then it will stay there.</p>
<p>Given the original configuration of the snow, help Kaguya
    figure out what the snow looks like after it all falls!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers, denoting the number of
    rows in the grid <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \: (1 \leq N
    \leq 100)$</span>, and the number of columns in the grid
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M \: (1 \leq M \leq
    100)$</span>.</p>
<p>Then, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines follow,
    where each line is a string of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, where each character is either a
    period ‘.’ or the capital letter ‘S’. A period ‘.’ represents
    nothingness, and the letter ‘S’ represents snow.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a grid of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> characters, representing the final
    configuration of the grid. This output grid should also only
    consist of periods ‘.’ and the capital letter ‘S’.</p>
