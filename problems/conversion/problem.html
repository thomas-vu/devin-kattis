<p>To help support a patent defense, we need to recover some
    experimental data that was stored as single precision floating
    point on a now-defunct Gould Power-Node mini-computer. The
    Gould used a base 16 floating-point format. We want to convert
    Gould floating point values, as much as possible, to single
    precision <em>IEEE</em> floating-point values.</p>
<p>The Gould internal floating-point format has 1 sign bit,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, a 7-bit offset (base
    16) exponent field, <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span>,
    and a 24-bit (6 hex digits) hexadecimal mantissa. (Note that
    this means that up to 3 high bits of the mantissa may be
    zero.)</p>

<p>Floating-point zero is represented by 32 bits of 0.</p>
<p>The IEEE format has 1 sign bit, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, an 8-bit offset (base 2) exponent
    field, <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span>, and a 24-bit
    mantissa, for which the high bit is (in normalized numbers)
    always 1 and not part of the 23 bits in the format.</p>

<p>If the exponent is not 255 and not 0, the value is a
    normalized floating point number,</p>

<p>If the exponent is 255 and the mantissa is 0, the value is
    plus or minus infinity (depending on the sign bit). If the
    exponent is 255 and the mantissa is not 0, it indicates special
    values that will not be used in this problem.</p>
<p>If the exponent is 0 and the mantissa is zero, the value is
    plus or minus zero (depending on the sign bit).</p>
<p>If the exponent is 0 and the mantissa is not zero, the value
    is a de-normalized floating-point number with:</p>

<p>Write a program that takes as input a floating-point value
    in Gould format and outputs the value in IEEE format as
    follows:</p>
<p>If the value is zero return (plus) zero.</p>
<p>If the value is too large to be represented as a normalized
    floating-point value, return plus or minus infinity depending
    on the sign.</p>
<p>If the value is too small to be represented as a normalized
    floating-point value:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If it may be represented as a de-normalized value,
        return the de-normalized value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, return plus or minus zero, depending on the
        sign.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In all other cases, return the normalized value.</p>
<p>If there are less significant bits than required for IEEE
    floating-point, extend with 0 bits.</p>
<p>If there are more significant bits than required for IEEE
    floating-point, truncate the extra bits.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 100$</span>) which is the number
    of data sets that follow. Each data set should be processed
    identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by 8 hex digits
    (<tt class="ttfamily">0-9,A-F</tt>) of the Gould floating-point
    value.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is one line of output. The single
    output line consists of the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single space
    followed by the 8 hex digits (<tt class="ttfamily">0-9,A-F</tt>) of the corresponding (as described
    above) IEEE floating point value.</p>
