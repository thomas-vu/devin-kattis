</div>Your friend Claire has dragged you along to a speedcubing
    event that is happening in Eindhoven. These events are all
    about solving the Rubik’s cube and similar twisty puzzles as
    quickly as possible. The attendants of the event can enter into
    various competitions based on the type and size of the puzzle,
    and there are even special competitions where the puzzles need
    to be solved one-handed or blindfolded.
    <p>Claire is competing in the most popular competition:
    speedsolving the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\times 3\times
    3$</span> Rubik’s cube, pictured on the right. Each contestant
    needs to solve the cube five times, each time with a different
    random scramble. After all solves are completed, the best and
    the worst times are discarded and the final score is the
    average of the remaining three times. The contestant with the
    smallest final score wins.</p>
<p>Claire has done well in the competition so far and is among
    the contenders for the overall victory. All the other
    contestants have already finished their five solves, but Claire
    has one solve remaining. By looking at the final scores of the
    other contestants, she has deduced her own target final score.
    As long as her final score is less than or equal to this target
    score, she will be declared the overall winner. Is it possible
    for her to win the competition, and if so, what is the worst
    time she can have on her last solve in order to do so?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with four real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_4$</span>, the times Claire got on her
        first four solves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with a real number <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, Claire’s target final score,
        the worst final score she can have in order to be declared
        the overall winner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each number is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>, inclusive, and is given with
    exactly two decimal places.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is not possible for Claire to win the event, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”. If she will win
    regardless of the time she gets on her last solve, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">infinite</tt>”. Otherwise, output the
    worst time she can have on her last solve in order to be
    declared the overall winner. Output the number to
    <em>exactly</em> two decimal places.</p>
