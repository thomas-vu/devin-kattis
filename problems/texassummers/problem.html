<p>Summer in Texas can be very hot. But Texans are tough, and
    in a weird way some of them enjoy the heat; for even the heat
    is bigger in Texas. But the heat can be quite uncomfortable for
    computer science students who are new to Texas and are not used
    to the sweating it can cause.</p>
<p>These students want to minimize the amount they sweat while
    walking from their dormitory to class. When they enter the
    sunshine, they begin sweating at the rate <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_0$</span> gallons/hour (where <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_0 &gt; 0$</span>). The longer they stay in
    the sun, the more they sweat. They sweat at a rate proportional
    to the square of how long they have been continuously exposed
    to the sun. Put another way, if they are exposed to the sun for
    twice as long, they sweat four times as much. But if they find
    a shady spot along the way, their continuous sun exposure is
    broken and they stop sweating immediately. They can then sit in
    the shade and cool off completely before continuing on their
    journey to class. Of course, leaving the shade means they begin
    sweating again, but starting at the lower rate <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_0$</span> (since they have cooled
    off).</p>
<p>Write a program that helps a student find a path from the
    dormitory to class which minimizes the total amount of sweat
    she expends.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input describes the locations of shady spots on campus as
    well as the student’s dormitory and class locations. Input
    begins with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq n \leq 2500$</span>, the number of
    shady spots. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contains a pair of integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x~ y$</span> specifying the
    coordinates of a shady spot. No two shady spots have the same
    coordinates. Following the shady spots are two more lines in
    the same format which specify the coordinates of the student’s
    dormitory and class, respectively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a path the student can take to get from her dormitory
    to class. The path should minimize the total sweat produced
    along the whole path. Print the path as indexes of the shady
    spots (from the order given in the input, with the first shady
    spot having index 0). If the best path contains no shady spots,
    output a single ‘-’. If there are multiple paths that minimize
    the total sweat, print any one of them.</p>
