<p>Hardwoods are the botanical group of trees that have broad
    leaves, produce a fruit or nut, and generally go dormant in the
    winter.</p>
<p>America’s temperate climates produce forests with hundreds
    of hardwood species – trees that share certain biological
    characteristics. Although oak, maple and cherry all are types
    of hardwood trees, for example, they are different species.
    Together, all the hardwood species represent <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span> percent of the trees in the
    United States.</p>
<p>On the other hand, softwoods, or conifers, from the Latin
    word meaning “cone-bearing,” have needles. Widely available US
    softwoods include cedar, fir, hemlock, pine, redwood, spruce
    and cypress. In a home, the softwoods are used primarily as
    structural lumber such as <span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \times 4$</span>s and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \times
    6$</span>s, with some limited decorative applications.</p>
<p>Using satellite imaging technology, the Department of
    Natural Resources has compiled an inventory of every tree
    standing on a particular day. You are to compute the total
    fraction of the tree population represented by each
    species.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input to your program consists of a list of the species of
    every tree observed by the satellite; one tree per line. Names
    use only printable ASCII characters (<span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span>-<span class="tex2jax_process">$126$</span>) and neither begin nor end with
    space. No name exceeds <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> characters. There are no more
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span> species
    and no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\,
    000$</span> trees.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the name of each species represented in the
    population, in alphabetical order (by the ASCII ordering),
    followed by the percentage of the population it represents,
    accurate to an absolute error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span>.</p>
