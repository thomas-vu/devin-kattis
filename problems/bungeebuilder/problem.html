<div class="problembody">
<p>A new bungee jumping attraction is to be built at a mountain
    range of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> mountains of
    heights <span class="tex2jax_process">$H_1, H_2, \ldots , H_
    N$</span>. This project involves constructing a horizontal
    bridge connecting two distinct mountains, on which the
    attraction will be opened. The bridge may be built at any
    height up to the minimum of the two connecting mountains as
    long as it is strictly higher than all mountains between the
    two.</p>
<p>Once the bridge is built, the attraction will be opened at
    some point along it. The jumping distance is limited by the
    vertical distance of the attraction from the ground directly
    below. In order to achieve the greatest level of excitement,
    the bridge should be built to maximise the distance of the
    furthest point from the ground.</p>
<p>Consider the following example:</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth ]{example.png}" src="/problems/bungeebuilder/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:80.00%"/>
</center>
<p>The optimal bridge is denoted by the solid red line and the
    jumping distance is denoted by the dotted red line.</p>
<p>Your task is to determine the maximum jumping distance
    achievable. If no bridge can be built, the distance is
    zero.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 10^6$</span>), the number of mountains. The second
    line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$H_1, H_2, \ldots , H_ N$</span>
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$H_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le H_ i \le 10^9$</span>) denotes the
    height of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text
    {th}$</span> mountain.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The maximum jumping distance possible.</p>
