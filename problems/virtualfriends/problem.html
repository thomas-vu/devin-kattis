<p>These days, you can do all sorts of things online. For
    example, you can use various websites to make virtual friends.
    For some people, growing their social network (their friends,
    their friends’ friends, their friends’ friends’ friends, and so
    on), has become an addictive hobby. Just as some people collect
    stamps, other people collect virtual friends.</p>
<p>Your task is to observe the interactions on such a website
    and keep track of the size of each person’s network.</p>
<p>Assume that every friendship is mutual. If Fred is Barney’s
    friend, then Barney is also Fred’s friend.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer specifying the
    number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a
    line containing a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span>, the number of friendships formed.
    Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span>
    lines contains the names of two people who have just become
    friends, separated by a space. A name is a string of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> letters (uppercase or lowercase).
    The sum of <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> over all
    test cases in the file is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Whenever a friendship is formed, print a line containing one
    integer, the number of people in the social network of the two
    people who have just become friends.</p>
