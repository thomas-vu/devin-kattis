<p>Your bartending skills have much improved since you joined
    ScrollBar. In particular, you have learned a wide variety of
    recipes for small drinks called <em>shots</em>. Shots are
    typically mixed from different liquids containing varying
    levels of alcohol. For reasons of fairness towards your
    customers, you want to compare the alcohol contents of your
    recipies.</p>
<p>Given two shot recipes, determine if they have the same
    alcohol content or not.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>: the number of ingredients in the
    first shot and the second shot, respectively. Both <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> are at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> lines describes the ingredients in
    the first shot, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> lines with the ingredients in the
    second shot.</p>
<p>An ingredient is described by two integers: the amount
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> that was used (in
    centilitres), and its alcohol content <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (by volume) in precent. We have
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq v\leq 100$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq c\leq 100$</span>.</p>
<p>There are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>
    centilitres in each shot.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <tt class="ttfamily">different</tt> if the shots
    differ in alcohol content, and <tt class="ttfamily">same</tt>
    otherwise.</p>
