</div>There are different methods of transporting people from
    place to place: cars, bikes, boats, trains, planes, etc. For
    very long distances, people generally fly in a plane. But this
    has the disadvantage that the plane must fly around the curved
    surface of the earth. A distance travelled would be shorter if
    the traveller followed a straight line from one point to the
    other through a tunnel through the earth.
    <p>For example, travelling from Waterloo to Cairo requires a
    distance of <span class="tex2jax_process">$9\, 293\,
    521$</span> metres following the great circle route around the
    earth, but only <span class="tex2jax_process">$8\, 491\,
    188$</span> metres following the straight line through the
    earth.</p>
<p>For this problem, assume that the earth is a perfect sphere
    with radius of exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$6\, 371\,
    009$</span> metres.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le T \le 1000$</span>, the
    number of test cases to follow. Each test case is one line
    containing four floating point numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text {lat}_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text {long}_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text {lat}_2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text {long}_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-90 \le \text {lat}_1, \text {lat}_2 \le
    90$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$-180 \le \text
    {long}_1, \text {long}_2 \le 180$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text {lat}_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text {long}_1$</span> are the latitude and
    longitude of the origin of the trip, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text {lat}_2, \text {long}_2$</span> are
    the latitude and longitude of the destination of the trip. All
    of these measurements are in degrees. Positive numbers indicate
    North latitude and East longitude, while negative numbers
    indicate South latitude and West longitude.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing a single real
    number, the difference in the distance between the two points
    following the great circle route around the surface of the
    earth and following the straight line through the earth, in
    metres. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error
    of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-7}$</span>.</p>
