<p>An airline tracks costs of flights between <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> different cities in a table. The
    cities are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. In the table, the entry in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{row}~ i$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{column}~ j$</span>
    represents the cost of a direct flight from <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{city}~ i$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{city}~ j$</span>. However, if there
    is no direct flight between these two cities, then a value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> is displayed in the
    table. A manager for the airline has decided that the table is
    too hard to read with all the <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> values; she does not like all the
    negativity. Instead, she would prefer a list of the flight
    prices for just the cities for which there are direct flights.
    Each entry in the list should specify the city from which the
    flight departs, the city at which the flight lands, and the
    price for the flight. The list should be sorted in increasing
    order by departure city, and if there is more than one flight
    departing from a city, then ties should be broken by the
    arrival city in increasing order. For example, the table on the
    left below should be turned into the list on the right. This
    matches the first sample input/output.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n \leq 100$</span>), the number of cities. This is
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines,
    each consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    space-separated integers, where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{\text {th}}$</span> value on the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> line
    indicates the cost of the flight from <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{city}~ i$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{city}~ j$</span>. A value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> is used to indicate
    that there is no direct flight from <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{city}~ i$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{city}~ j$</span>. It is guaranteed
    that there is no direct flight departing from and arriving at
    the same city. All costs will be strictly positive integers
    less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>. It
    is guaranteed that there will be at least one direct flight
    represented in the table.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first line of output is the number of direct flights,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>. This is to be
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines of
    the form <tt class="ttfamily"><span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span></tt>, indicating that there is a
    direct flight from <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{city}~ u$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{city}~ v$</span> with a cost of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{of}~ c$</span>. These
    must be printed in ascending order, sorted by departure city
    number with ties broken by the arrival city number.</p>
