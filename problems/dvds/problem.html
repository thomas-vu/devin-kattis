<p>Dezider is very unhappy as he just discovered that his DVDs
    got unsorted. Dezider is (occasionally) very organized and
    during one of his get-organized spells he numbered the DVDs
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. He keeps the DVDs in a tall stack
    and he wants to have them sorted in increasing order by their
    number, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> at the
    bottom and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> at the top
    of the stack. The trouble is that his space allows him to
    perform only one type of sorting operation: take a DVD, pull it
    out of the stack while the DVDs above it fall down by one
    position, then place it at the top of the stack. What is the
    smallest number of such operations he needs to do to sort the
    DVD stack?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, the number of input instances.
    Each input instance is described on two lines. The first line
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 1\, 000\,
    000$</span>. The second line lists the DVDs in the initial
    order on the stack, from the bottom to the top.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    lines. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line
    corresponds to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    input. It contains the smallest number of operations needed to
    sort the stack.</p>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>In the first sample input it suffices to take DVD
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> and move it to the top
    of the stack; then the stack is sorted. In the second sample
    input one can first move DVD <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> and then DVD <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> to get a sorted stack.</p>
