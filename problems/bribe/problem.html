<div class="problembody">
<p>After having done a lot of spying and infiltrating a
    criminal network, you are now ready to try and dismantle it.
    This, however, requires the cooperation of a certain number of
    the henchmen. This in turn requires money in order to bribe
    them, but due to budget cuts, you only have a limited amount of
    money.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you are an excellent judge of character, so for
    each of the henchmen you are considering to bribe, you know
    what amount of money they will ask for. Furthermore, you know
    the probability that they will then successfully convert, as
    opposed to taking the money and making a run for it. There is
    no particular rush, so after each attempted conversion you can
    establish whether it was successful or not, before you move on
    to someone else. Of course, if it was not successful, then you
    cannot try to bribe this henchman a second time.</p>
<p>Given all this information on the henchmen, the amount of
    money that you have at your disposal, and the number of
    henchmen you need to convert, can you work out the probability
    that this operation will be a success?</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with three space-separated integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n, c \leq 16$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 1\,
        000$</span>): the number of henchmen that are susceptible
        to bribe, the number you need to convert, and the amount of
        money that you have, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines with two
        space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq b \leq 1\, 000$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq p \leq 100$</span>):
        the amount of money you need to bribe each henchman, and
        the probability (as a percentage) that he will be
        successfully converted, respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a single floating point number: the
        probability that you will succeed in converting
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> henchmen, if you
        take an optimal approach. This number should be accurate up
        to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> relative
        or absolute precision.</p>
</li>
