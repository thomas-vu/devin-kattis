<div class="problembody">
<p>Given a bag full of rope segments, you will build the
    longest loop of rope while alternating colors. The bag contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> segments and each
    segment will either be blue (<span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>) or red (<span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>). You are required to alternate
    between colors and because of this requirement you might not
    use every segment in the bag. If you only have segments of a
    single color, you will not be able to tie any knots and should
    output <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. Each segment
    length is provided in centimeters and each knot in the loop
    consumes one centimeter of length from the loop. In other
    words, a knot consumes one-half of a centimeter from of the two
    segment it connects.</p>
<p>Note that pieces of string that have length 1, if used in
    making the cycle, might get reduced to just a pair of knots of
    total length 0. This is allowed, and each such piece counts as
    having been used.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input gives the number of cases,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> test cases follow. For each test
    case there will be:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing the value <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, the number of rope segments
        in the bag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing a space separated list of
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> values. Each value
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> indicates the
        segment length in centimeters followed by the letter
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> to indicate the segment
        color.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq S
    \leq 1000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq L
    \leq 100$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing "Case
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>: " followed by the
    maximum length of the rope loop that can be generated with the
    rope segments provided.</p>
