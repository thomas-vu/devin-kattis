<p>Many are familiar with the board game Ticket To Ride<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> where players compete to build a
    railway empire, claiming routes between cities. The game
    consists of a map of cities and various rail segments each
    connecting two adjacent cities.</p>
<p>A key way to score points towards winning the game is to
    complete <i class="itshape">Destination Tickets</i>. Each
    ticket specifies two distinct cities. A player earns the points
    that are indicated on the ticket if they have claimed one or
    more rail segments that form a path connecting the two
    cities.</p>
<p>There is one ticket for each distinct unordered pair of
    cities. In our version of the game, each player is randomly
    given a ticket and they have an equal probability of receiving
    any ticket. Given a list of rail segments you have already
    claimed, determine the probability you earn points from the
    ticket you are given.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 10^5$</span>), which is the number of cities, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq M \leq 10^6$</span>), which is the
    number of rail segments you have claimed.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines
    describe your claimed rail segments. Each line contains two
    distinct integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq N$</span>) and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq j \leq N$</span>), which are the
    cities that this rail segment connects.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the probability you earn points from the ticket you
    are given.</p>
<p>Your answer should have an absolute error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
