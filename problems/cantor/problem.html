<p>The ternary expansion of a number is that number written in
    base <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. A number can
    have more than one ternary expansion. A ternary expansion is
    indicated with a subscript <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. For example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 = 1_{3} = 0.222\ldots _{3}$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.875 = 0.212121\ldots
    _{3}$</span>.</p>
<p>The Cantor set is defined as the real numbers between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> inclusive that have a ternary
    expansion that does not contain a <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. If a number has more than one
    ternary expansion, it is enough for a single one to not contain
    a <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 = 0.000\ldots
    _{3}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 = 0.222\ldots
    _{3}$</span>, so they are in the Cantor set. But <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.875 = 0.212121\ldots _{3}$</span> and this
    is its only ternary expansion, so it is not in the Cantor
    set.</p>
<p>Your task is to determine whether a given number is in the
    Cantor set.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several test cases, at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>.</p>
<p>Each test case consists of a single line containing a number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> written in decimal
    notation, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x \le
    1$</span>, and having at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> digits after the decimal
    point.</p>
<p>The last line of input is <tt class="ttfamily">END</tt>.
    This is not a test case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output <tt class="ttfamily">MEMBER</tt>
    if <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is in the Cantor
    set, and <tt class="ttfamily">NON-MEMBER</tt> if <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is not in the Cantor set.</p>
