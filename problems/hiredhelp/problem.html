<div class="problembody">
<p>Viv’s shoe repair company has seen a spike in demand. Today,
    she has a backlog of shoes that need repairs. So Viv wants to
    hire some people to assist with the extra work. According to
    labour laws, each employee is not allowed to repair more than a
    certain number of shoes (say <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>) each day. Each shoe takes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> minute to repair: no
    more, no less. Each shoe also has a deadline: if it is not
    repaired by the deadline then the customer gets mad and takes
    their business elsewhere.</p>
<p>Viv believes everyone should put in an honest day’s work. If
    an employee fixes fewer than <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> shoes today then Viv would prefer
    to not have hired them at all. In fact, she believes in this so
    strongly that she would prefer to lose business from clients
    than have an employee not complete their quota.</p>
<p>Help Viv determine the maximum number of employees she can
    hire so: a) each employee can repair <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> shoes before their deadlines, and
    b) each shoe is (of course) repaired by at most one
    employee.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a line consisting of two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10^5$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq K \leq N$</span>) where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the number of shoes that need
    to be repaired and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> is
    as described above.</p>
<p>Then a second line follows containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_1, \ldots , d_ N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d_ i \leq 10^9$</span>
    for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq
    N$</span>) describing the deadlines for the repairs. That is,
    if the repair of shoe <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    is not completed within at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span> minutes of the start of the day
    then client <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> will take
    their business elsewhere.</p>
<p>Note, the days can be much longer on Viv’s planet than
    ours.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> on a single line indicating the
    maximum number of employees such that it is possible to
    allocate <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> shoes to each
    employee and each employee can complete their assigned repairs
    before their respective deadlines, assuming all employees start
    working on their list of assigned jobs at the start of the
    day.</p>
