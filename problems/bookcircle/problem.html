<div class="problembody">
<p>A couple of computer science students have decided to start
    a book circle, in which they will be able to share the passion
    of their lives, namely reading. Finally, the first season of
    reading is coming to its end, and the students in the book
    circle are going to present their fantastic books to the rest
    of the computer science students. However, there is a problem.
    To attract audience to the presentation, one of the book circle
    members (without mentioning any names) has promised the
    audience that a book circle member will sing in between each
    two presentations. The person who made this promise doesn’t
    know how to sing, so he or she must have been thinking that
    someone else in the group could do the singing. But in fact, no
    one in the group wants to sing. The book circle always sticks
    to its promises, which means there is some singing to do.
    However, they have also promised to present all of the books
    that they have read. Someone in the group has figured out that
    if they minimize the number of presentations – they will
    minimize the number of times they have to sing, since if a
    student has read several books, he or she can present a bunch
    of them in the same presentation. But how should this be
    carried out?</p>
<p>Your task is to help the book circle calculate the minimum
    number of presentations needed such that all books that have
    been read will be presented. You will be given the number of
    boys in the group, and the number of girls in the group. You
    will also be given the book titles read by each student. Each
    book that was read was read by exactly one girl and one
    boy.</p>
<p>Students always present books alone, and they can present
    only the books that they have read.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line consists of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le B,G \le 1\, 000$</span>, the number of
    boys and girls respectively. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> lines, each starting with the name
    of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>:th boy. Then
    follows an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_ i$</span>,
    the number of books that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>:th boy has read. Then follow
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_ i$</span> book titles on the
    same line. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span>
    lines, each starting with the name of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>:th girl. Then follows an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_ i$</span>, the number of
    books that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th girl
    has read. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_
    i$</span> book titles on the same line.</p>
<p>The book titles and student names consist solely of
    alphanumeric characters, and they don’t have spaces in them.
    They both have between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> characters. Also,
    no two students will share names.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output should start with a single number <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, the minimum number of
    presentations needed.</p>
