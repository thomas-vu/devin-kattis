<p>You have a single 3D printer, and would like to use it to
    produce <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> statues.
    However, printing the statues one by one on the 3D printer
    takes a long time, so it may be more time-efficient to first
    use the 3D printer to print a new printer. That new printer may
    then in turn be used to print statues or even more printers.
    Print jobs take a full day, and every day you can choose for
    each printer in your possession to have it print a statue, or
    to have it 3D print a new printer (which becomes available for
    use the next day).</p>
<p>What is the minimum possible number of days needed to print
    at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> statues?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 10\, 000$</span>), the number of statues you need to
    print.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the minimum number of days needed
    to print at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    statues.</p>
