<p>Luke wants to upgrade his home computer network from 10mbs
    to 100mbs. His existing network uses 10base2 (coaxial) cables
    that allow you to connect any number of computers together in a
    linear arrangement. Luke is particulary proud that he solved a
    nasty NP-complete problem in order to minimize the total cable
    length.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Luke cannot use his existing cabling. The
    100mbs system uses 100baseT (twisted pair) cables. Each
    100baseT cable connects only two devices: either two network
    cards or a network card and a hub. (A hub is an electronic
    device that interconnects several cables.) Luke has a choice:
    He can buy <span class="tex2jax_process">$2N-2$</span> network
    cards and connect his <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    computers together by inserting one or more cards into each
    computer and connecting them all together. Or he can buy
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> network cards and a
    hub and connect each of his <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> computers to the hub. The first
    approach would require that Luke configure his operating system
    to forward network traffic. However, with the installation of
    Winux 2007.2, Luke discovered that network forwarding no longer
    worked. He couldn’t figure out how to re-enable forwarding, and
    he had never heard of Prim or Kruskal, so he settled on the
    second approach: <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    network cards and a hub.</p>
<p>Luke lives in a loft and so is prepared to run the cables
    and place the hub anywhere. But he won’t move his computers. He
    wants to minimize the total length of cable he must buy.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \le 100$</span>, the number of
    computers. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    follow; each gives the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> coordinates (in mm.) of a
    computer within the room. All coordinates are integers between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>. No two computers have the
    same coordinates.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single number, the total length in mm of the cable
    segments, with an absolute error or relative error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
