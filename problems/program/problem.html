<div class="problembody">
<p>Mirko is trying to debug a piece of his code. First he
    creates an array of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    integers and fills it with zeros. Then he repeatedly calls the
    following C++ procedure:</p>
<pre>
void something( int jump ) {
  int i = 0;
  while( i &lt; N ) {
    seq[i] = seq[i] + 1;
    i = i + jump;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>As you can see, this procedure increases by one all elements
    in the array whose indices are divisible by <tt class="ttfamily">jump</tt>.</p>
<p>Mirko calls the procedure exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> times, using the sequence
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_1,X_2,X_3, \ldots , X_
    k$</span> as arguments.</p>
<p>After this, Mirko has a list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> special parts of the array he
    needs to check to verify that his code is working as it should
    be. Each of these parts is defined by two numbers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$L
    \leq R$</span>) the left and right bound of the special part.
    To check the code, Mirko must compute the sum of all elements
    of seq between and including <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>. In other words <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathtt{seq}[L] + \mathtt{seq}[L+1] +
    \mathtt{seq}[L+2] + \ldots + \mathtt{seq}[R]$</span>. Since he
    needs to know the answer in advance in order to check it, he
    asked you to help him.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 10^6$</span>), the size of the array, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq K \leq 10^6$</span>), the number of
    calls to <tt class="ttfamily">something</tt> that Mirko
    makes.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_1,X_2,X_3, \ldots ,X_ k$</span>, the
    arguments passed to the procedure (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq X_ i &lt; N$</span>).</p>
<p>The third line contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq Q \leq 10^6$</span>), the number of special parts of the
    array Mirko needs to check.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines
    contain two integers each <span class="tex2jax_process">$L_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$R_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq L_ i \leq R_ i &lt;
    N$</span>), the bounds of each special part.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should contain exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line should contain the sum of
    elements <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathtt{seq}[L_ i] +
    \mathtt{seq}[L_ i+1] + \mathtt{seq}[L_ i+2] + \ldots +
    \mathtt{seq}[R_ i]$</span>.</p>
