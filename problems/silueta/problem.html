<p>The main hero of this task, painter Vincent, spent a great
    deal of his youth travelling the world. Sights from numerous
    voyages have often been the inspiration for his, nowadays
    highly praised, works of art. On one occasion, Vincent found
    himself in a metropolis full of skyscrapers so he got down to
    work right away, intoxicated by the marvelous sight. For a
    number of reasons, incomprehensible to an average programmer,
    Vincent decided to paint only the <em>silhouettes</em> of the
    skyscrapers seen before him. Unfortunately, a week after he
    finished this masterpiece, the painting spontaneously caught
    fire.</p>
<p>In order to reconstruct the painting, Vincent sought help in
    all directions; architects provided him with the exact
    dimensions of the skyscrapers, physicists ignored air
    resistance, mathematicians mapped everything onto a plane and
    now it’s your turn!</p>
<p>From your perspective, Vincent’s skyscrapers are rectangles
    whose sides are parallel to coordinate axes and with one side
    that lies on the abscissa. Part of the abscissa on the image
    should be shown with the characters ‘<tt>*</tt>’, the
    silhouettes of the skyscrapers with ‘<tt>#</tt>’ and fill the
    rest of the image with ‘<tt>.</tt>’. The left edge of the image
    must begin with a skyscraper, whereas the right edge of the
    image must end with a skyscraper. Additionally, in order to
    verify the results the mathematicians got, output <em>the
    perimeter</em> of the given silhouette not calculating the
    sides that lie on the abscissa.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: Clarification of the first example: Blue
          color denotes the skyscrapers’ silhouette (character
          ‘<tt class="ttfamily">#</tt>’), whereas yellow is the
          part of abscissa located on Vincent’s painting (character
          ‘<tt class="ttfamily">*</tt>’).

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 10\, 000$</span>), the number of skyscrapers.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$R_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$H_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq L_ i,\, R_ i,\, H_ i \leq 1\,
    000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq R_ i - L_ i
    \leq 1\, 000$</span>) that describe the position of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th skyscraper. That
    skyscraper, in a Cartesian coordinate system, is considered a
    rectangle with its lower left corner in <span class="tex2jax_process">$(L_ i, 0)$</span> and upper right corner in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(R_ i,H_ i)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first line of output must contain the perimeter of
    Vincent’s silhouette.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$h+1$</span> lines,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$h+1$</span> is the height
    of the highest skyscraper, must contain Vincent’s drawing as
    described in the task.</p>
