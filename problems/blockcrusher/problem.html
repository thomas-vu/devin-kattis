<div class="problembody">
<p>You are responsible for testing the compressive strength of
    various composite materials. You take a rectangular block,
    crush it from the sides and see where it beaks. This is hard
    work, and itâ€™s dirty, so you decide to write a simulator to get
    yourself some help.</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth ]{block1.png}" src="/problems/blockcrusher/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:35.00%"/> <img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.35\textwidth ]{block2.png}" src="/problems/blockcrusher/file/statement/en/img-0002.png" style="width:35.00%"/>
</center>
<p>Computationally, you model a block as being composed of a
    grid square regions of materials of various strengths. You
    model the strength of a square as an integer between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>. When sufficient force is applied
    from the sides, the block will shatter along a <i class="itshape">fracture line</i>. The fracture line is a path
    through the squares that starts in a square along the top edge
    of the block and ends in a square along the bottom edge. Among
    all such paths, the fracture line is the one that minimizes the
    total strength (<i class="itshape">i.e.</i>, the sum of the
    strength values) of all the squares on the path. The fracture
    line can travel from square to square up, down, left, right or
    diagonally as it goes from the top edge to the bottom edge.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> block descriptions. Each block
    description starts with a line containing two integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le h \le 20$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le w \le 60$</span>, giving
    the height and width of the block. This is followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> lines of <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> digits each, where each digit is
    in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \ldots 9$</span>.
    The end of all block descriptions is marked by values of zero
    for <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each block, print a copy of the block with the digits
    along its fracture line replaced by spaces. There will only be
    one fracture line that has the minimum strength. Print a blank
    line after each block.</p>
