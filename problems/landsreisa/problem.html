<p>Stefán and Eva live in Vestmannaeyjar. Eva wants to see the
    entire country. They intend to visit every location in the
    country exactly once and then end up back in Vestmannaeyjar.
    Stefán hates traveling and thus wants to spend the least amount
    of time traveling between locations. If Stefán travels for too
    long he gets annoyed which in turn annoys Eva. Eva wants to
    keep Stefán in a good mood and thus has asked for your help
    making a travel plan. The shorter the travel plan the more
    satisfied Stefán will be.</p>
<p>The starting location of Stefán and Eva is location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. They always travel
    with the same speed between locations. It’s possible to travel
    between any two locations in both directions. To simplify
    things the world is two dimensional, where each longitude has
    been converted into an <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
    value and each latitude has been converted into a <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> value. Since the world is two
    dimensional we use Euclidean distance.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input to this problem is not secret like in other
    problems, it can be found <a href="/problems/landsreisa/file/statement/attachments/iceland.txt">here</a>.</p>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of locations. Next
    there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines. Each
    contains two real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$-25 \leq x \leq -13$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$63 \leq y \leq 67$</span>. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line denotes the coordinates of
    location <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. The values
    have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> digits
    after the decimal point. Below there is an image of the given
    input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the travel plan on one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> numbers, separated by spaces,
    where each number is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n - 1$</span> with each value appearing
    exactly once. The numbers should signify in what order the
    locations are visited. The first value should always be
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>The score is given as an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x \leq 100$</span>. If the length of
    your travel plan is <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    then <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = \left\lfloor 100 \cdot
    \left( 1 - \frac{k - 63}{100} \right)^4 \right\rfloor
    $</span>.</p>
