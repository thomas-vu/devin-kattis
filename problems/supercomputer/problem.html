<p>Jóhann, Marteinn and Símon have decided to make the next
    generation of supercomputers! They know that it probably won’t
    be long before Quantum computers take over, but since they
    don’t know anything about Quantum mechanics, they want to rush
    these new supercomputers out into the market, make their money,
    and hopefully retire with their wealth.</p>
<p>Since they’re trying to sell these things, they decide they
    need some cool features to promote the computers. Marteinn
    suggests painting flames on the back of the computers to make
    it look like they’re computing faster. Jóhann agrees, but
    suggests also adding a second keyboard so people can type
    faster, just like in that TV show: NCIS. Símon also agrees, but
    he thinks there’s something missing. What are they forgetting?
    Ah, of course, faster memory!</p>
<p>They decide to add an <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>-bit memory that supports the
    following two operations:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>given an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, flip the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>:th bit of the memory (changing
        a <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to a
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and a
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to a <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>), and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>given integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, count how
        many bits between the <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>:th bit and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>:th bit are set to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After announcing their new supercomputer with these three
    awesome features, they immediately received a large amount of
    orders. Of course everyone wants a supercomputer with flames
    painted on the back! But now it’s time to actually implement
    these features. While Jóhann, Marteinn and Símon are busy
    painting the computers and supplying more keyboards, they’ve
    hired you to implement their memory.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10^6$</span>), the number
        of bits in the memory, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq K \leq 10^5$</span>), the number
        of queries;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> lines each of
        the form:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">F <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span></tt> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq N$</span>)
            representing a query to flip the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>:th bit in memory;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">C <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span></tt> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq l \leq r \leq N$</span>)
            representing a query to count the number of
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> bits in the
            range from <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> to
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>,
            inclusive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> bits in the
    memory are initially set to <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query of the second type, output a single line
    containing the number of bits set to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> in the given range.</p>
