<p>Everyone knows that the highlight of Halloween at HiQ is
    their annual costume contest. In their costume contest, they
    have <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> categories of
    costumes that they give a “best of” award to, such as most
    <em>malignant mummy</em>, most <em>ghoulish ghost</em> and most
    <em>wicked witch</em>. Judges are very lazy, however. When
    picking a winner in each of the costume categories, they simply
    pick one of the costumes at random to give the award to.</p>
<p>This year, you want to win. After 5 consecutive years as
    runner-up in the category <em>darkest demon</em> you have
    decided to throw away your costume and only optimize for
    winning. You have polled your colleagues about what category of
    costume they are entering with in the contest. Given their
    responses, can you figure our what costume you should bring to
    maximize your chance of winning?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 1\, 000$</span>), the number of colleagues you have
    polled on their costumes. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains their responses.
    Each response is a string of between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> letters <tt class="ttfamily">a-z</tt>. You know that for each category in the
    contest, you have at least one colleague participating with
    such a costume.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the costume category you have the highest chance of
    winning with. If multiple categories are tied for highest, you
    should output them all in lexicographic order.</p>
