<div class="problembody">
<p>Jim Ratt has just joined a local fitness center. He’s
    especially excited about a sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> machines that he cycles through
    three times for his workout. He has a fixed time which he
    spends on each machine, as well as a fixed recovery time after
    using a machine. Jim’s not the brightest guy in the world, but
    in the absence of anything else even he would easily be able to
    calculate how long his workout would take.</p>
<p>But of course, Jim isn’t the only person who uses the
    fitness center and wouldn’t you know it but when Jim shows up
    there are always <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    other people there, each using one of the ten machines
    exclusively. Like Jim, each person has a fixed time they use on
    their machine as well as a fixed recovery time. This will
    sometimes cause Jim to have to wait for a particular machine,
    and Jim’s usage sometimes results in the other people having to
    wait as well (though if both Jim and another person want to
    start using a machine at the same time, Jim is polite enough to
    let the other person go first). Jim has gone to the center
    often enough that he has a good idea what everyone’s usage and
    recovery times are, but he has trouble determining how long it
    will take him to perform his workout. That’s where you are
    going to flex your programming muscles.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line containing twenty integers; the
    first two give Jim’s usage and recovery time for machine
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, the next two give
    Jim’s usage and recovery time for machine <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, etc. The next line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>; the first two values are the
    usage and recovery times for the person who is using machine
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> is the time when he/she first
    starts using the machine. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> lines specify similar information
    for machines <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> through
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. All usage and
    recovery times are positive and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\leq 5\, 000\, 000$</span> and all start
    times <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> satisfy
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$|t| \leq 5\, 000\, 000$</span>.
    You should assume that Jim is ready to use machine <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the time when Jim has finished his workout, i.e.,
    the moment when he has finished his usage time on machine
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> for the third time
    (don’t count the last recovery time for that machine).</p>
