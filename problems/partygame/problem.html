<p>Lord Kevin (purportedly a distant relative of Lord Kelvin)
    is holding a party to celebrate his recent entrance into the
    British nobility. The exact process whereby Kevin acquired his
    title is a matter of some dispute, and there are even whispered
    rumours of identity theft, but fortunately we need not concern
    ourselves with such unpleasantries here. All the invitees to
    Kevin’s party are British Lords with whom he hopes to
    ingratiate himself, and since Kevin has detected that these
    nobles are a rather reserved lot, he has invented a party game
    to facilitate interactions among his guests. As the Lords
    arrive at Kevin’s manor, they are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Each Lord is given a lapel pin on
    which is written his unique identifying number, and he is asked
    to wear this pin throughout the evening. (Kevin, who is
    organizing the game but not participating in it, does not have
    an assigned number.) Once all the guests have assembled in the
    ballroom, Kevin takes a set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cards on which are written the
    numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (one number per card),
    places them in his top hat, and then draws them out at
    random and distributes them to his guests, one per Lord. Now
    the party game is ready to begin.</p>
<p>The game consists of a sequence of rounds, each of which has
    three stages. In Stage <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, Kevin calls out “Match!”, at
    which point each Lord checks to see if the number on the card
    in his hand matches the number on his lapel pin. If so, the
    Lord is freed from the game and can move into the dining room
    to partake of the fine food (and drink) waiting there. In
    Stage <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, Kevin
    calls out “Hat!”, at which point each remaining Lord memorizes
    the number on the card in his hand, and then places the card in
    the brim of his top hat. In Stage <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, Kevin calls out “Snatch!”, at
    which point each Lord finds the other guest in the room whose
    lapel pin contains the number he has just memorized, and then
    snatches (or, more politely, gently takes) the card from that
    Lord’s hat. (Since British nobles are also called
    <em>peers</em>, Stage <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> is an example of a
    <em>peer-to-peer protocol</em>.) At the end of Stage 3,
    each Lord once again has a numbered card in his hand, ready for
    the next round to begin. Note that at the end of
    Stage <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, if all
    Lords have been freed from the game, the game is over, so
    obviously Kevin will skip the final Stages <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>.</p>
<p>Kevin thinks that this game he has invented will be very fun
    for his guests, but he is a little worried that some of the
    Lords might stay trapped in the game forever, eventually dying
    of starvation. Given the initial distribution of numbered cards
    to guests, help Kevin determine whether or not the game will
    have such a dire outcome.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq T \leq 10)$</span>, the number of
    test cases that follow. Each test case occupies two lines. The
    first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq n \leq 1\, 200)$</span>, the number of guests at the
    party. The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> distinct space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_ n$</span>,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq i \leq n)$</span> is the number on
    the card initially given to the Lord whose lapel pin contains
    the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines, one per case. For each test
    case, output “<tt class="ttfamily">All can eat.</tt>” if the
    game eventually ends, or “<tt class="ttfamily">Some
    starve.</tt>” if the game never ends.</p>
