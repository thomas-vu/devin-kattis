<div class="problembody">
<p>Ashley and Brandon are playing a game where they roll a
    six-sided dice four times. Each integer from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> is on one face of the dice and all
    values are equally likely to appear. Each time they roll the
    dice, they write down the value that shows on the top face of
    the dice, eventually forming a four-digit integer.</p>
<p>Ashley wins if all four digits in the integers are
    different. Otherwise, Brandon wins.</p>
<p>The dice has been rolled from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> times so far. Compute the number
    of different ways to roll the remaining times such that Ashley
    wins, and the number of different ways to roll the remaining
    dice such that Brandon wins. Two ways are different if the
    integers formed are different - for example, rolling a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, then a <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, then a <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, then a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> forms the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1234$</span>, and is different from rolling
    a <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, then a <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, then a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, then a <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, which would form the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1243$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 3$</span>), which is the number of times the dice
    have been rolled so far.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers ranging from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>, which are the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> rolls of the dice in order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two space-separated integers on one line, which are
    the number of ways to roll the remaining times such that Ashley
    wins, and the number of ways to roll the remaining dice such
    that Brandon wins.</p>
