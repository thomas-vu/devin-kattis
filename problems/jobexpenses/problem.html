<p>At ACME Corp, the seller Robin is selling software like
    hotcakes. To sell the software, he arranges meetings all over
    the country. Of course, he always needs to travel there, and
    sometimes even stay the night. Other times, he decides that a
    hot dog on the way to a meeting counts as accommodation.</p>
<p>Because Robin is very busy, he hasnâ€™t been able to file his
    job expenses this month. Eret, the accountant, told him that he
    could fix it for him, as long as he got the price of all the
    expenses along with the receipts. Robin did this but misheard
    him: He has provided a list of all expenses <em>and</em>
    incomes he has brought in last month, with incomes as positive
    integers and expenses as negative integers.</p>
<p>Can you help Eret find out how much expenses Robin has paid
    for the last month?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consist of two lines: One line with the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, and one line with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_ i$</span>, representing the numbers Robin
    has written down.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the sum of all the expenses Robin has paid for the
    last month.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq N \leq 20\,
        000$</span></p>
