</div>Last time I visited Shanghai I admired its beautiful
    skyline. It also got me thinking, "Hmm, how much of the
    buildings do I actually see?" since the buildings wholly or
    partially cover each other when viewed from a distance.

    <p>In this problem, we assume that all buildings have a
    trapezoid shape when viewed from a distance. That is, vertical
    walls but a roof that may slope. Given the coordinates of the
    buildings, calculate how large part of each building that is
    visible to you (i.e. not covered by other buildings).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 100$</span>), the number of buildings in the city.
    Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each
    describing a building. Each such line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x_1 &lt; x_2 \le 10 000, 0 \le y_1,
    y_2 \le 10 000$</span>). The buildings are given in distance
    order, the first building being the one closest to you, and so
    on.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each building, output a line containing a floating point
    number between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, the relative visible
    part of the building. The absolute error for each building must
    be within <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
