<div class="problembody">
<p>In the game of chess, there is a piece called the knight. A
    knight is special – instead of moving in a straight line like
    other pieces, it jumps in an "L" shape. Specifically, a knight
    can jump from square <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r_1,
    c_1)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r_2,
    c_2)$</span> if and only if <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r_1
    - r_2)^2 + (c_1 - c_2)^2 = 5$</span>.</p>
<p>In this problem, one of our knights is going to undertake a
    chivalrous quest of moving from the top-left corner (the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 1)$</span> square) to the
    bottom-right corner (the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(H,
    W)$</span> square) on a gigantic board. The chessboard is of
    height <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> and width
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>.</p>
<p>Here are some restrictions you need to know.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The knight is so straightforward and ardent that he is
        only willing to move towards the right and the bottom. In
        other words, in each step he only moves to a square with a
        bigger row number and a bigger column number. Note that,
        this might mean that there is no way to achieve his goal,
        for example, on a <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\times
        10$</span> board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>
        squares on the chessboard that contain rocks with evil
        power. Your knight may not land on any of such squares,
        although flying over them during a jump is allowed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your task is to find the number of unique ways for the
    knight to move from the top-left corner to the bottom-right
    corner, under the above restrictions. It should be clear that
    sometimes the answer is huge. You are asked to output the
    remainder of the answer when divided by <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 007$</span>, a prime number.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a line containing a single integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> test cases follow.</p>
<p>The first line of each test case contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$H, W,$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> lines each contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> integers each, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, the row and column numbers of one
    rock. You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,
    1)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(H, W)$</span>
    never contain rocks and that no two rocks are at the same
    position.</p>
<p>You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N
    \leq 15, 0 \leq R \leq 10, 1 \leq W \leq 10^8, 1 \leq H \leq
    10^8, 1 \leq r \leq H, 1 \leq c \leq W$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line of output, prefixed
    by “<tt class="tt">Case #</tt><span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span><tt class="tt">:</tt>”, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is the 1-based case
    number, followed by a single integer indicating the number of
    ways of reaching the goal, modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 007$</span>.</p>
