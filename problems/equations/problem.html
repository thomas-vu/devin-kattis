<div class="problembody">
<p>Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> linear
    equations on the variables <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, solve for <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 100$</span>, the number of test
    cases. Each test case consists of two equations, each on a
    separate line. An empty line separates cases.</p>
<p>An equation consists of at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> terms separated by addition,
    subtraction, or equality operators. A term is an integer, or a
    variable name (<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> or
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>) optionally preceded
    by a minus sign or an integer coefficient. There is exactly one
    equality operator. Constant terms and coefficients are at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> in absolute value.
    All operators are surrounded by spaces, and there are no spaces
    within terms.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, print two lines, giving the values of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> as rationals in simplest terms. If
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> has no unique rational value such
    that both equations hold, print “<tt class="ttfamily">don’t
    know</tt>” for its value. Print an empty line between
    cases.</p>
