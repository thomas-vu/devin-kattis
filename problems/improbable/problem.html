<div class="problembody">
<p>It is a sunny day in spring and you are about to meet
    Patrick, a close friend and former partner in crime. Patrick
    lost most of his money betting on programming contests, so he
    needs to pull off another job. For this he needs your help,
    even though you have retired from a life of crime. You are
    reluctant at first, as you have no desire to return to your old
    criminal ways, but you figure there is no harm in listening to
    his plan.</p>
<p>There is a shipment of expensive consumer widgets in a
    nearby warehouse and Patrick intends to steal as much of it as
    he can. This entails finding a way into the building,
    incapacitating security guards, passing through various arrays
    of laser beams – you know, the usual heist techniques. However,
    the heart of the warehouse has been equipped with a security
    system that Patrick cannot disable. This is where he needs your
    help.</p>
<p>The shipment is stored in large cubical crates, all of which
    have the same dimensions. The crates are stacked in neat piles,
    forming a three-dimensional grid. The security system takes
    pictures of the piles once per hour using three cameras: a
    front camera, a side camera and a top camera. The image from
    the front camera shows the height of the tallest pile in each
    column, the image from the side camera shows the height of the
    tallest pile in each row, and the image from the top camera
    shows whether or not each pile is empty. If the security system
    detects a change in any of the images, it sounds an alarm.</p>
<p>Once Patrick is inside, he will determine the heights of the
    piles and send them to you. Figure 1 shows a possible
    layout of the grid and the view from each of the cameras.</p>

<p>Patrick wants to steal as many crates as possible. Since he
    cannot disable the security system, he plans to fool it by
    arranging the remaining crates into piles so that the next set
    of camera images are the same. In the above example, it is
    possible to steal nine crates. Figure 2 shows one possible
    post-heist configuration that appears identical to the security
    system.</p>
<p>Patrick asks you to help him determine the maximum number of
    crates that can be stolen while leaving a configuration of
    crates that will fool the security system. Will you help him
    pull off this final job?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le r \le 100$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le c \le 100$</span>), the number of rows and columns in the
    grid, respectively. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> integers, the heights (in crates)
    of the piles in the corresponding row. All heights are between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the maximum number of crates that can be stolen
    without being detected.</p>
