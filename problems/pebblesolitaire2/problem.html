<p>I bet you have seen a pebble solitaire game. You know the
    game where you are given a board with an arrangment of small
    cavities, initially all but one occupied by a pebble each. The
    aim of the game is to remove as many pebbles as possible from
    the board. Pebbles disappear from the board as a result of a
    move. A move is possible if there is a straight line of three
    adjacent cavities, let us call them <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> in the middle, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> is vacant, but <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> each contain a pebble. The move
    consists of moving the pebble from <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, and removing the pebble in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> from the board. You
    may continue to make moves until no more moves are
    possible.</p>
<p>In this problem, we look at a simple variant of this game,
    namely a board with 23 cavities located along a line. In the
    beginning of each game, some of the cavities are occupied by
    pebbles. Your mission is to find a sequence of moves such that
    as few pebbles as possible are left on the board.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: In a) there are two possible moves,
          namely <span class="tex2jax_process">$8 \rightarrow
          6$</span>, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$7
          \rightarrow 9$</span>. In b) the result of the
          <span class="tex2jax_process">$8 \rightarrow 6$</span>
          move is depicted, and again there are two possible moves,
          <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \rightarrow 7$</span>,
          or <span class="tex2jax_process">$6 \rightarrow
          4$</span>. Making the first of these results in c), from
          which there are no further moves.

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \le 10$</span> on a line of its own.
    Thereafter <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> different
    games follow. Each game consists of one line of input with
    exactly 23 characters, describing the 23 cavities of the board
    in order. Each character is either ‘<tt class="ttfamily">-</tt>’ or ‘<tt class="ttfamily">o</tt>’. A
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">-</tt>’ character denotes an empty
    cavity, whereas an ‘<tt class="ttfamily">o</tt>’ character
    denotes a cavity with a pebble in it. There is at least one
    pebble in all games.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    games in the input, output the minimum number of pebbles left
    on the board possible to obtain as a result of moves, on a line
    of its own.</p>
