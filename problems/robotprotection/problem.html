<p>You are developing a new robotic guard that can wander
    around and look for suspicious activity in your home. The robot
    is small and not smart enough to maneuver by itself. Instead,
    you set up fixed-location beacons in the region you want it to
    protect. The robot is programmed to walk toward a single
    beacon, any beacon, in a straight line. When it reaches a
    beacon, it turns and walks towards another beacon, chosen at
    random. It can also stop and change course at any time, not
    just when it reaches a beacon. It does this all day long,
    relaying surveillance information to a master computer. In this
    way, it covers a lot of ground.</p>
<p>Given a configuration of beacons, your job is to determine
    the area that the robot can patrol. You should assume that the
    robot starts at the first beacon of the configuration.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> configurations of beacons. Each
    configuration starts with a line containing the number of
    beacons, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 10\,
    000$</span>. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines each describe one beacon with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x~ y$</span>, where both are in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-10\, 000,10\, 000]$</span>.
    Input ends when <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each configuration of beacons, output the area the robot
    has to patrol. Your answer should be accurate to within
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.1$</span> square units.</p>
