        Illustration of Sample Input 2
      </div>
</div>
<p>Pumpkin Pete is trying out a new type of “rapid-growth”
    pumpkin seed that he bought from the farmer’s market. Without
    looking at the directions, Pumpkin Pete tears through the
    packaging and plants the seeds he has into his pumpkin patch.
    Unbeknownst to Pumpkin Pete, his rival, Gourd Gary, is watching
    him plant the new seeds from a secret vantage point. After
    Pumpkin Pete leaves the pumpkin patch, Gourd Gary approaches
    the patch and picks up the packaging that Pumpkin Pete left on
    the ground. The packaging says the following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>A pumpkin starts with four roots of length zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each of the pumpkin’s four roots grow a single unit in a
        different cardinal direction each day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a pumpkin dies, its remains will not disappear.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <i class="itshape">any</i> of the roots grow into
        another pumpkin or its roots – dead or alive – the pumpkin
        will die at the end of that day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roots cannot grow outside of the bounds of a plot. In
        other words, a pumpkin will die if one of its roots tries
        to go outside the bounds of the pumpkin patch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the roots of multiple pumpkins reach the same spot on
        the same day, each one of the affected roots stops growing
        (i.e. fight for nutrients) and in turn, the pumpkins will
        die at the end of the day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a pumpkin dies, its roots do not grow on subsequent
        days.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With this information and the knowledge of where each of the
    pumpkin seeds were planted, Gourd Gary starts to think about
    which pumpkins would still be alive if they were left to grow
    for <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> days<span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span></p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input contains three integers: the number
    of pumpkins <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, the
    number of days <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> that
    will pass (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq D \leq
    10$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 30, 1 \leq P \leq
    N^2$</span>) the dimension of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N\times N$</span> grid. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> lines of input contain
    two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq R,C &lt; N$</span>), representing the
    row and column position of each pumpkin. No two pumpkins will
    be at the same position. Position <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span> is the top left corner of the
    grid.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output will consist of a single line per pumpkin in the
    same relative order as the input. If the pumpkin is alive after
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> days have passed,
    print “<tt class="ttfamily">ALIVE</tt>”. Otherwise, print the
    day the pumpkin died as a single integer.</p>
