        A bus with a number that is not a <em>bus number</em>
        according to our definition. License: public domain
      </div>
</div>A famous story about the mathematicians <em>G.H.
    Hardy</em> and <em>Srinivasa Ramanujan</em> goes as follows (as
    told by Hardy):

    <blockquote class="quote">
      I remember once going to see him (Ramanujan) when he was
      lying ill at Putney. I had ridden in taxicab No. 1729, and
      remarked that the number seemed to be rather a dull one, and
      that I hoped it was not an unfavourable omen. “No”, he
      replied, “it is a very interesting number; it is the smallest
      number expressible as the sum of two [positive] cubes in two
      different ways.”
    </blockquote>
<p>It is from this story the <em>taxicab numbers</em> got their
    name. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>’th taxicab
    numbers is defined to be the smallest number that can be
    expressed as a sum of two <em>positive</em> cube numbers in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> distinct ways.</p>
<p>It turns out that these numbers grows rather quickly. This
    makes them very hard to compute, which is not very fun. A
    variation of the concept is to consider what we will call the
    <em>bus numbers</em> – all the numbers which can expressed as
    the sum of two <em>positive</em> cube numbers in <em>at
    least</em> <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> distinct
    ways. Note that according to this definition, all taxicab
    numbers (except the first) are also bus numbers.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a program that generates bus numbers;
    in particular, the <em>largest</em> bus number that is <em>at
    most</em> equal to some limit <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le 400\, 000$</span>), the
        upper bound of the bus number.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the largest bus number <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> which does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>. If there is no such number,
    output <tt class="ttfamily">none</tt>.</p>
