<p>Per works at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology, and thus
    grades <b class="bfseries">a lot</b> of exams each day.</p>
<p>The grading process is rather simple. First, you define five
    grading limits <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span>. At least <span class="tex2jax_process">$a \% $</span> of the exam score is required
    to get an A grade, at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$b \%
    $</span> is required for a B, and so on, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$e \% $</span> is required to get an E. If
    you get less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$e \% $</span>
    you get an F.</p>
<p>Per’s management has recently complained about a lot of
    mistakes that Per made during grading, so they want you to
    construct a program to help Per grade exams.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains the five integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$100 \ge a &gt; b &gt; c &gt; d &gt; e \ge
    0$</span>).</p>
<p>The second line contains a single integer – the exam score
    in percent of an exam Per is currently grading.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single letter <tt class="ttfamily">A-F</tt> – the
    grade of the exam Per is currently grading.</p>
