<p>Everyone knows of the secret agent double-oh-seven, the
    popular Bond (James Bond). A lesser known fact is that he
    actually did not perform most of his missions by himself; they
    were instead done by his cousins, Jimmy Bonds. Bond (James
    Bond) has grown weary of having to distribute assign missions
    to Jimmy Bonds every time he gets new missions so he has asked
    you to help him out.</p>
<p>Every month Bond (James Bond) receives a list of missions.
    Using his detailed intelligence from past missions, for every
    mission and for every Jimmy Bond he calculates the probability
    of that particular mission being successfully completed by that
    particular Jimmy Bond. Your program should process that data
    and find the arrangement that will result in the greatest
    probability that all missions are completed successfully. Note
    that the number of missions is equal to the number of Bonds, so
    that every Jimmy Bond needs to be assigned <em>a single
    mission</em> each.</p>
<p><b class="bfseries">Note</b>: the probability of all
    missions being completed successfully is equal to the product
    of the probabilities of the single missions being completed
    successfully.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line will contain an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of Jimmy Bonds and
    missions (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le
    20$</span>).</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    will contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, inclusive. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>:th integer on the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>:th line is the
    probability that Jimmy Bond <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> would successfully complete
    mission <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, given as a
    percentage.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum probability of Jimmy Bonds successfully
    completing all the missions, as a percentage.</p>
<p>Your answer should have an absolute error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Explanation of third sample</h2>
<p>If Jimmy bond <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is
    assigned the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>:rd
    mission, Jimmy Bond <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>:st mission and
    Jimmy Bond <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>:nd mission the
    probability is: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1.0 \cdot 0.13
    \cdot 0.7 = 0.091 = 9.1\% $</span>. All other arrangements give
    a smaller probability of success.</p>
