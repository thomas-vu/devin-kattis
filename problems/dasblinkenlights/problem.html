<p>There are two lights that blink at regular intervals. When
    each one blinks, it turns on and then immediately back off;
    they donâ€™t toggle. They are both off at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t = 0$</span>. The first one blinks at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t=p, 2p, 3p, \ldots $</span>
    seconds; the second one blinks at <span class="tex2jax_process">$t=q, 2q, 3q, \ldots $</span> seconds. Once
    they start, they both keep blinking forever. It is
    <em>very</em> exciting to see them blink at the same time (on
    the same second). But your patience is going to run out
    eventually, in <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
    seconds. Will they blink at same time between <span class="tex2jax_process">$t=1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t=s$</span> (inclusive)? Write a program
    that can answer this question, quick, before they start
    blinking again!</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of one line containing three space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>. The bounds are <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le p, q \le 100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le s \le 10\, 000$</span>. The first
    light blinks every <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>
    seconds, the second every <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> seconds. The value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> represents the maximum number of
    seconds to consider when determining if the two lights blink at
    the same time.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <tt class="tt">yes</tt> if the two lights blink on
    the same second between time <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and time <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, or <tt class="tt">no</tt>
    otherwise.</p>
