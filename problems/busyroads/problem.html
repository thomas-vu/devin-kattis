<div class="problembody">
<p>Robert lives in ERPLand, a country with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> cities numbered 1 to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. Each day in this country has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> seconds, numbered 0 to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C - 1$</span>. There are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> bi-directional roads
    connecting pairs of cities. Road <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> connects cities <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i, B_ i$</span>, takes Robert
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ i$</span> seconds to travel
    through, and can only be entered between the <span class="tex2jax_process">$L_ i$</span>-th and <span class="tex2jax_process">$R_ i$</span>-th second (both inclusive) in
    each day (no restriction on exit time). It is possible to get
    from any city to any other city directly or indirectly using
    the roads, and there might be multiple roads connecting the
    same pair of cities.</p>
<p>Robert lives in city 1, and wants to get to city
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> to visit his friend,
    Bert. He is allowed to wait in cities to take a break,
    sightsee, or just wait for roads to open. Help him find out the
    minimum amount of time in seconds he needs to get to city
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> if he starts at time 0
    seconds on some day.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> denoting the number of cities,
    number of roads and the number of seconds in each day
    respectively <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2 \leq N \leq
    100000, N - 1 \leq M \leq 200000, 1 \leq C \leq
    10^9)$</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines contains 5 integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i, B_ i, T_ i, L_ i, R_
    i$</span> which are as described above <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq A_ i, B_ i \leq N, A_ i \neq B_ i, 1
    \leq T_ i \leq 10^9, 0 \leq L_ i \leq R_ i &lt; C)$</span>.</p>
<p><b class="bfseries">It is guaranteed that Robert can get
    from city 1 to city N.</b></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the minimum amount of time in
    seconds he needs to get from city 1 to city <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
