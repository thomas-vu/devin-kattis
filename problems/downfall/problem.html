<p>There is a heavy rainfall over the Antique Cultural Museum,
    and the roof has sprung a leak! All the beautiful paintings
    risk destruction, if it weren’t for one brave night watchman
    standing in the water’s way – Klunkas Plaskocek.</p>
<p>To protect all of the paintings, Klunkas has brought
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> buckets and placed
    them in a long row to catch the water falling from the ceiling.
    Each bucket can hold exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> drops of water. If a drop falls
    into a bucket which is full, the water drop will overflow to
    the bucket standing to the left. If that bucket is full as
    well, the drop will keep flowing left until there is a non-full
    bucket.</p>
<p>Klunkas needs your help to prevent the leftmost bucket
    overflowing. After every drop of water falls, Klunkas wants to
    know which bucket it ended up in, so that he can keep track of
    the water levels of the buckets.</p>
<p>Due to the very regular nature of rain, Klunkas figured that
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rain drops fall in
    a very nice pattern. Given constants <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_0, A, B$</span>, we define the sequence
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_ i$</span> as</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ X_ i = (A \cdot X_{i-1} + B) \mod N
    \]</span>
<p>The bucket which the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th rain drop falls into, is then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_ i$</span> for <span class="tex2jax_process">$i = 1, \dots , R$</span>. The leftmost
    bucket has the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>,
    and the rightmost bucket has the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of the space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 10^6$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le R \le 10^7$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le K \le 10$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le X_0, A, B \le 2^{31} - 1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the leftmost bucket overflows, output “<tt class="ttfamily">OVERFLOW</tt>”.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the output should be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$O_ i$</span> be the
    bucket which the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>:th
    rain drop ended up in, and let <span class="tex2jax_process">$a
    = 0$</span>.</p>
<p>Then, for every <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, set <span class="tex2jax_process">$a := (53 \cdot a + O_ i) \mod
    199933$</span>.</p>
<p>The output should then be a line with the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>.</p>
