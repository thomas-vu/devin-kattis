<p>The most famous painting in Byteland—a portrait of a lady
    with a computer mouse by Leonardo da Bitci—needs to be
    conserved. The work will be conducted in two narrowly
    specialized laboratories. The conservation process has been
    divided into several stages. For each of them, we know the
    laboratory in which it will take place.</p>
<p>Transporting the very precious and fragile painting
    introduces additional risk; therefore, it should be avoided
    whenever possible. Ideally, all the work in the first
    laboratory would be done, and then the painting would be moved
    to the second one. Unfortunately, there are several
    dependencies between the conservation stages—some of them need
    to be completed before others may begin. Your task is to find
    an ordering of conservation stages that minimizes the number of
    times the painting needs to be moved from one laboratory to the
    other. The conservation can begin in any of the two
    laboratories.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains the number of test
    cases <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le T \le 35\, 000$</span>.
    The descriptions of the test cases follow:</p>
<p>The first line of each test case contains two
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 100\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq m \leq 1\, 000\, 000$</span>)—the number of conservation
    stages and the number of dependencies between them. In the next
    line there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    space-separated integers—the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th of them is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> if the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th conservation stage will take
    place in the first laboratory, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> otherwise. The following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines contain pairs of
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq i, j \leq n$</span>), denoting that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th stage has to be completed
    before the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th. The sum
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> overall
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases is at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\cdot 10^6$</span>.</p>
<p>You may assume that it is always possible to order the
    conservation stages so that all the dependencies are
    satisfied.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the answers to the test cases in the order in which
    they appear in the input. For each test case, output a single
    line containing the minimal number of times the painting needs
    to be transported between the laboratories.</p>
