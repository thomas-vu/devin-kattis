<p>As you might have heard, Gunnar is an old and forgetful
    researcher. Most of his research is in security and he cares a
    bit too much about his own security, so for each website he has
    a different password. It would be very hard for him to remember
    all passwords, so for every website he only remembers the
    method he used to create the password.</p>
<p>For one of the very important websites he started with a
    file containing a long list of non-negative integers. Since he
    very much likes the operation <span class="tex2jax_process">$\oplus $</span> (xor), his password is a xor
    of some integers in the list. Note that the operation xor is
    defined on boolean values as <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\oplus 0=1\oplus 1=0$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\oplus 1=1\oplus 0=1$</span>.
    We can then extend this definition to integers, namely we first
    write the two integers in binary and then do xor for each two
    corresponding bits in the numbers. For example the xor of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$12=(1100)_2$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5=(101)_2$</span> is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9=(1001)_2$</span>. Instead of
    addition, we can use the operation xor when summing numbers and
    we call this modified sum <em>xor-sum</em>.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Gunnar’s file contains a list of numbers and he selected a
    subset of the numbers such that its xor-sum is as large as
    possible. The resulting number was his password. Unfortunately,
    he forgot the algorithm to find the subset with the largest
    xor-sum, so he is asking you for help with restoring his
    password. Of course, he will not tell you for which website
    this password is.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\le n\le 100\, 000)$</span>: the length of
    the list of numbers in Gunnar’s file. The second line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, \dots , a_
    n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\leq a_ i \le
    10^{18})$</span>, the numbers in the file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with the answer – the maximal number Gunnar
    can get by selecting a subset of the list of numbers and
    calculating the xor-sum of the subset.</p>
