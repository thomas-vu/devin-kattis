<div class="problembody">
<p>Instructors ann and ben firmly believe that everything
    should be alphabetical, especially names. (They also don’t
    believe in capital letters!) They take alphabetical order to
    such an extreme that they even order the letters of their names
    when listed together. For example, the last time they co-taught
    they listed the instructors as <tt class="tt">abennn</tt>! They
    are taking their classes on a class field trip, so they need to
    merge their lists of students. Fortunately, they each have
    their student lists in order, so merging the lists should be
    quick. If ann has <tt class="tt">john</tt> and <tt class="tt">amy</tt> in her class and ben has <tt class="tt">jack</tt>
    and <tt class="tt">jill</tt> in his class, their two lists
    would be <tt class="tt">ahjmnoy</tt> and <tt class="tt">acijjkll</tt>. The field trip list would be <tt class="tt">aachijjjkllmnoy</tt>.</p>
<p>Given ann’s and ben’s lists, produce the field trip
    list.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of exactly two lines. Each line contains a
    string of from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> lower case letters.
    These are ann’s and ben’s lists.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single string of lower case letters, which
    represents the merging of ann’s and ben’s lists.</p>
