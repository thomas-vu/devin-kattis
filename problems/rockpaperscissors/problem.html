<p>Rock-Paper-Scissors is game for two players, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, who each choose, independently of
    the other, one of rock, paper, or scissors. A player chosing
    paper wins over a player chosing rock; a player chosing
    scissors wins over a player chosing paper; a player chosing
    rock wins over a player chosing scissors. A player chosing the
    same thing as the other player neither wins nor loses.</p>
<p>A tournament has been organized in which each of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> players plays
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> rock-scissors-paper
    games with each of the other players, so there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$kn(n-1)/2$</span> games in total. Your job
    is to compute the win average for each player, defined as
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w / (w + l)$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> is the number of games
    won, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> is the number
    of games lost, by the player.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of several test cases. The first line of
    input for each case contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 100, 1 \leq k \leq 100$</span> as defined above.
    For each game, a line follows containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1, m_1, p_2, m_2$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p_1 \leq n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p_2 \leq n$</span> are distinct
    integers identifying two players; <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_2$</span> are their respective moves
    ("rock", "scissors", or "paper"). A line containing 0 follows
    the last test case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line each for player 1, player 2, and so on,
    through player <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, giving
    the playerâ€™s win average rounded to three decimal places. If
    the win average is undefined, output "-". Output an empty line
    between cases.</p>
