<p>The ancient and mysterious Apaxian civilization, which we
    most certainly did not make up, continues to confound the
    researchers at the Oriental Institute. It turns out that the
    Apaxians had a peculiar naming system: the more letters in your
    name, the higher your status in society. So, in Apaxian
    society, <tt class="ttfamily">robert</tt> was probably a lowly
    servant, and <tt class="ttfamily">robertapalaxiamethostenes</tt> was likely a High
    Priest or Minister. Even more than that, Apaxians valued the
    number of adjacent letters that were the same in a name. So,
    while <tt class="ttfamily">robert</tt> continues to be an
    unimpressive name, <tt class="ttfamily">roooooooooobert</tt>
    probably elicited cheers and applause wherever he went.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this makes the task of reading Apaxian
    scrolls very cumbersome, especially when you consider that a
    particularly famous Apaxian queen had ten thousand consecutive
    <tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>’s in her name. Legend has it that
    she was already two years old by the time the Royal Herald
    finished announcing her birth.</p>
<p>To make the Oriental Institute’s life easier, the Department
    of Computer Science has offered to convert the Apaxian scrolls
    into a more readable format. Specifically, we will be taking
    Apaxian names and replacing all consecutive runs of the same
    letter by a single instance of such letter.</p>
<p>So, for example, the compact version of <tt class="ttfamily">roooobert</tt> would be <tt class="ttfamily">robert</tt>, where the four consecutive <tt class="ttfamily">o</tt>’s have been replaced with a single <tt class="ttfamily">o</tt>. Similarly, the compact version of <tt class="ttfamily">rrrooobbbert</tt> would also be <tt class="ttfamily">robert</tt>. On the other hand, the compact version
    of <tt class="ttfamily">robert</tt> is still <tt class="ttfamily">robert</tt>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single name. Each name contains only
    lowercase letters (<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>–<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>), no whitespace, a minimum length of 1
    character, and a maximum length of 250 characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output contains the compact version of the name: any
    time the same letter appears two or more times in sequence, it
    must be replaced by a single instance of that letter.</p>
