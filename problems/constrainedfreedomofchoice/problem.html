<div class="problembody">
<p>You live in a rectangular grid of ASCII characters. Your
    home is in the lower left corner and you work in the upper
    right corner. Sidewalks look like periods (<tt class="tt">.</tt>) and buildings, cars, trash cans and other
    obstacles look like pound signs (<tt class="tt">#</tt>). You
    walk to work each day by starting at your home and then moving
    one grid location at a time either up, down or to the right.
    You can’t move to the left (until it’s time to go home at the
    end of the day). Also, you refuse to step on the same location
    twice on your way to work. Thus in the figure shown, the two
    paths on the left would be legal ways to get to work, but the
    two on the right would not.</p>

<p>You like to take different paths to work each day. Given a
    map of your city, you would like to know how many different
    choices you have for getting to work. Two paths are different
    if they visit a different sequence of locations.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of multiple map descriptions. Each starts
    with a line containing a pair of positive integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r~ c$</span>, giving the height
    and width of the map. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines of characters, each
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> characters long and
    each consisting of only periods and pound signs. The map is
    never larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    characters wide and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    characters tall and both the lower left and upper right
    locations are always periods. A value of zero for both
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> marks the end of input. The input
    contains at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>
    map descriptions.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each map, print out a line giving the number of
    different, legal paths that take you from your home to work.
    This number is less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{31}$</span>.</p>
