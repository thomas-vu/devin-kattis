<p>Do you know what attracts almost any college student to
    participate in an event? Yes, free food. It doesnâ€™t matter
    whether the event involves a long (sometimes boring) seminar.
    As long as free food is served for the event, then students
    will surely come.</p>
<p>Suppose there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    events to be held this year. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> event is scheduled
    from day <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> to day
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>, and free food is
    served for that event every day from day <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> to day <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> (inclusive). Your task in this
    problem is to find out how many days there are in which free
    food is served by at least one event.</p>
<p>For example, let there be <span class="tex2jax_process">$N =
    3$</span> events. The first event is held from day <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>, the second event is held from
    day <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span>, and the third event is held from
    day <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span>. The days in which free food is
    served by at least one event are <span class="tex2jax_process">$10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 25,
    26$</span>, for a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> days. Note that both events serve
    free food on days <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 100$</span>) denoting the number of events. Each of
    the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le s_ i \le t_ i \le
    365$</span>) denoting that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> event will be held
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> (inclusive), and
    free food is served for all of those days.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output contains an integer denoting the number of days
    in which free food is served by at least one event.</p>
