<p>Poffins are one of the most delicious treats that Pokemon
    love to eat. You want to reward your <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> Pokemon for their hard work in
    helping you become the Pokemon Champion, so you decide to buy
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> poffins and you lay
    them in a pile for all the Pokemon to take. Each Pokemon takes
    some amount of poffins (potentially even no poffins) until no
    poffins remain in the pile. However, you notice that some
    Pokemon didn’t end up getting as many poffins as others, so you
    set out to distribute the poffins more fairly. You line up your
    Pokemon in a certain order and go through them one by one until
    you reach the end of the line, repeating a specific process for
    each Pokemon in order as follows:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>If the current Pokemon doesn’t have a poffin, skip the
        following steps and move on to the next Pokemon in the
        line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take one poffin from the current Pokemon.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give that poffin to the Pokemon with the least number of
        poffins (it might be the same Pokemon you took the poffin
        from). If there are multiple Pokemon with the least number
        of poffins, you may pick any of them to give the poffin
        to.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After completing this process, you notice that the Pokemon
    with the most amount of poffins has <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> poffins and the Pokemon with the
    least poffins has <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>
    poffins. What is the minimum value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$P-p$</span> over all possible ways the
    Pokemon initially took poffins?</p>
<p>For example, if you had <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> Pokemon and bought <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> poffins, one way to achieve the
    minimum value is if two of the three Pokemon took <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> poffin and one took <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> poffins initially. Then, after the
    redistribution process, <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, so <span class="tex2jax_process">$P-p=1$</span>, which happens to be the
    minimum value across all initial distributions of poffins to
    Pokemon in this case.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one line containing integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>. This denotes the number of
    Pokemon (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq
    10^7$</span>) and the total number of poffins (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq 10^9$</span>)</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing the minimum value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P-p$</span>.</p>
