<p>Anna and Bob are having a baby. They both enjoy the
    advantage of having palindrome names, meaning that their names
    are spelled the same way forwards and backwards. Wanting to be
    good parents, they decide to give their child a palindrome name
    too. The only problem is that they aren’t sure if the one they
    picked is a palindrome. If it turns out it isn’t a palindrome,
    they want to change it to a palindrome using as few changes as
    possible. The allowed changes are:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Change a letter of the name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a letter to the end of the name.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Help Bob and Anna find out how many changes they need to
    make to the name to make it a palindrome.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input is the name they have chosen.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of changes they need to make.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The length of the name is at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The name consists of only lowercase letters a–z.</p>
</li>
</ul>
