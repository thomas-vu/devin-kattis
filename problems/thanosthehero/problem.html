<p>Thanos, as we all know, is the beloved character from a
    popular movie franchise who is a misunderstood hero and totally
    not a villain at all. Also, his favorite hobby is intergalactic
    mass genocide.</p>
<p>It is not Thanos’s goal to kill everyone in the entire
    universe – that’d make him a villain. Instead, Thanos is the
    hero that tries to create the perfect universe by reducing each
    world to what he believes is an appropriate population.</p>
<p>Thanos goes by one rule: For any two worlds <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, if Thanos prefers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>’s population must be strictly
    greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>’s.</p>
<p>There are in total <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    worlds in the universe, and Thanos has a strict total ordering
    of these worlds based on his preference. When Thanos’s rule is
    fulfilled on his ordering, the universe is
    <em>perfect</em>.</p>
<p>Thanos is now ready to go on a massive killing spree to
    create the perfect universe. At the same time, Thanos wants to
    minimize the number of lives he has to take; that is right,
    they call him “Thanos the merciful”, and totally not because
    he’s too lazy to kill more than he has to.</p>
<p>Given the ordering of Thanos’s preference of worlds and each
    world’s population, Thanos wants your help to determine how
    many lives he has to take exactly.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\leq N\leq 50\, 000)$</span>.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers separated by single
    spaces (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq a_ i\leq
    10^9$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>
    represents the population of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th world. Thanos prefers the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+1$</span>-st world to the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th world.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>One number which represents the number of lives Thanos takes
    today. If it is impossible to create the perfect universe,
    output <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> (Thanos kills
    himself).</p>
