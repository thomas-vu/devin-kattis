<p>The word is out that you’ve just finished writing a book
    entitled <i class="itshape">How to Ensure Victory at a
    Programming Contest</i> and requests are flying in. Not
    surprisingly, many of these requests are from foreign
    countries, and while you are versed in many programming
    languages, most spoken languages are Greek to you. You’ve done
    some investigating and have found several people who can
    translate between languages, but at various costs. In some
    cases multiple translations might be needed. For example, if
    you can’t find a person who can translate your book from
    English to Swedish, but have one person who can translate from
    English to French and another from French to Swedish, then
    you’re set. While minimizing the total cost of all these
    translations is important to you, the most important condition
    is to minimize each target language’s distance (in
    translations) from English, since this cuts down on the errors
    that typically crop up during any translation. Fortunately, the
    method to solve this problem is in Chapter <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> of your new book, so you should
    have no problem in solving this, right?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> indicating the number of target
    languages and the number of translators at your disposal
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100, 1 \leq m
    \leq 4\, 500$</span>). The second line will contain
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> strings specifying the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> target languages.
    After this line are <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines of the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_1$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$l_2$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_2$</span> are two different languages and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is a positive integer
    specifying the cost to translate between them (in either
    direction). The languages <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_2$</span> are always either English or one
    of the target languages, and any pair of languages will appear
    at most once in the input. The initial book is always written
    in English.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the minimum cost to translate your book to all of
    the target languages, subject to the constraints described
    above, or <tt class="tt">Impossible</tt> if it is not possible.
    You may assume that the minimum cost can be represented by a
    signed <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span>-bit
    integer.</p>
