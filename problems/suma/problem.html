<p>Mirko lives in a big enchanted forest where trees are very
    tall and grow really quickly. That forest can be represented as
    an <span class="tex2jax_process">$N\cdot N$</span> matrix where
    each field contains one tree.</p>
<p>Mirko is very fond of the trees in the enchanted forest. He
    spent years observing them and for each tree measured how many
    meters it <em>grew in a year</em>. The trees grow
    <em>continuously</em>. In other words, if the tree grows
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> meters in a year, it
    will grow <span class="tex2jax_process">$2.5$</span> meters in
    half a year.</p>
<p>Apart from trees, Mirko likes mushrooms from the enchanted
    forest. Sometimes, he eats suspicious colorful mushrooms and
    starts thinking about peculiar questions. Yesterday, this
    unfortunate thing happened and he wondered what would be the
    size of the <em>largest connected group of trees</em> that are
    all of <em>equal height</em> if the trees continue to grow at
    the same speed theyâ€™re growing at that moment.</p>
<p>Mirko quickly measured the current height of all trees in
    the forest and asked you to answer his question.</p>
<p>Two trees are <em>adjacent</em> if their fields in the
    matrix share a common edge.</p>
<p>Two trees are <em>connected</em> if there is a sequence of
    adjacent trees that leads from the first to the second.</p>
<p>A group of trees is <em>connected</em> if every pair of
    trees in the group is <em>connected</em>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 700$</span>).</p>
<p>After the first line, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines follow, each of them
    containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    integers.</p>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line
    contains integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_{ij}$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq h_{ij} \leq
    10^6$</span>), the initial height of tree in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th row and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th column, given in meters.</p>
<p>After that, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> more
    lines follow with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    integers each.</p>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line
    contains integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_{ij}$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq v_{ij} \leq
    10^6$</span>), the growth speed of the tree in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th row and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th column, given in meters.</p>
<p>Warning: Please use faster input methods beacuse the amount
    of input is very large. For example, either set
    <tt>ios::sync_with_stdio(false)</tt> or use <tt>scanf</tt>
    instead of <tt>cin</tt> in C++, and use <tt>BufferedReader</tt>
    instead of <tt>Scanner</tt> in Java.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the required
    number from the task.</p>
