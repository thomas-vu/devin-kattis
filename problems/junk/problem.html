</div>According to NASA’s web page, there are more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$500\, 000$</span> pieces of
    “space junk” that are tracked. Care must be taken in mission
    planning so satellites and other spacecrafts do not collide
    with these pieces of space junk.
    <p>For this problem, we will consider the simplified case in
    which both the spacecraft and the space junk can be modelled as
    spheres that are travelling in a straight line. Given the
    current locations of the two spheres as well as their
    velocities, when would they collide in the future, if ever?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 500$</span> indicating
    the number of test cases. Each test case is specified by two
    lines. The first line specifies the sphere representing the
    spacecraft, while the second line specifies the sphere
    representing the space junk. Each sphere is specified by the
    seven integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$ x, y, z, r, v_
    x, v_ y, v_ z$</span>. The center of the sphere is currently
    located at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y,z)$</span>, the
    radius of the sphere is <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, and the sphere is travelling
    along the direction specified by the vector <span class="tex2jax_process">$(v_ x,v_ y, v_ z)$</span>. If the vector is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0,0)$</span>, the sphere is
    stationary.</p>
<p>The absolute value of all integers are at most 100, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is positive. All
    coordinates and radii are measured in meters, and the
    velocities are measured in meters/second.</p>
<p>You may assume that the two spheres do not touch each other
    initially.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing the time (in
    seconds) at which the spacecraft first collides with the space
    junk. If they never collide, print <tt>No collision</tt>
    instead. Answers within 0.01 of the correct result are
    acceptable.</p>
