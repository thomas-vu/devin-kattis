<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$n^2$</span> upper bound
    for any sorting algorithm is easy to obtain: just take two
    elements that are misplaced with respect to each other and swap
    them. Conrad conceived an algorithm that proceeds by taking not
    two, but <i class="it">three</i> misplaced elements. That is,
    take three elements <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i} &gt;
    a_{j} &gt; a_{k}$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$i
    &lt; j &lt; k$</span> and place them in order <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{k},a_{j},a_{i}$</span>. Now if for the
    original algorithm the steps are bounded by the maximum number
    of inversions <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$</span>, Conrad is at his
    witsâ€™ end as to the upper bound for such triples in a given
    sequence. He asks you to write a program that counts the number
    of such triples.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input is the length of the sequence,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$</span>. The
    next line contains the integer sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{1},a_{2},\ldots ,a_{n}$</span>. You can
    assume that all <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i} \in [1,
    n]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of inverted triples.</p>
