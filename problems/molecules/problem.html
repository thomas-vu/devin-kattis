<div class="problembody">
<p>A molecule consists of atoms that are held together by
    chemical bonds. Each bond links two atoms together. Each atom
    may be linked to multiple other atoms, each with a separate
    chemical bond. All atoms in a molecule are connected to each
    other via chemical bonds, directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>The chemical properties of a molecule is determined by not
    only how pairs of atoms are connected by chemical bonds, but
    also the physical locations of the atoms within the molecule.
    Chemical bonds can pull atoms toward each other, so it is
    sometimes difficult to determine the location of the atoms
    given the complex interactions of all the chemical bonds in a
    molecule.</p>
<p>You are given the description of a molecule. Each chemical
    bond connects two distinct atoms, and there is at most one bond
    between each pair of atoms. The coordinates of some of the
    atoms are known and fixed, and the remaining atoms naturally
    move to the locations such that each atom is at the average of
    the locations of the connected neighboring atoms via chemical
    bonds. For simplicity, the atoms in the molecule are on the
    Cartesian <span class="tex2jax_process">$xy$</span>-plane.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 100$</span>), the number of
    atoms, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1 \leq m \leq
    \frac{n(n-1)}{2}$</span>), the number of chemical bonds.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    describe the location of the atoms. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> of which contains two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x, y$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x,y \leq 1\, 000$</span>
    or <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = y = -1$</span>), which
    are the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> atom. If
    both coordinates are <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>,
    however, the location of this atom is not known.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
    describe the chemical bonds. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> of which contains two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a &lt; b \leq n$</span>) indicating
    that there is a chemical bond between atom <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and atom <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that at least one atom has its location
    fixed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines that
    describe the final location of each atom. Specifically, on the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> such
    line, display two numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, the final coordinates of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> atom. If
    there are multiple solutions, any of them is accepted. A
    solution is accepted if the coordinates of each unknown atom
    and the average coordinates of all its neighboring atoms via
    chemical bonds differ by at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span>. Note that it is acceptable
    for multiple atoms to share the same coordinates.</p>
