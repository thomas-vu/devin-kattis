<p>Your parents decided that it would be “fun” to spend the
    entire Sunday walking near the Mookerheide close to
    Nijmegen.</p>
<p>Although you can pass the time by solving programming
    problems in your head, your siblings do not have the same
    luxury. After a short while, your younger sister Alice and your
    big brother Bob find themselves hopelessly bored. Together,
    they try to figure out if they can pass the time with a game (a
    problem that would later be referred to as the Bob and Alice
    Pastime Conundrum). Finally, they come up with the following
    simple game.</p>
<p>They find a single branch of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> that will be the main object of
    the game. Alternatingly, Alice and Bob choose a piece of branch
    and break it into two parts, in such a way that both parts have
    integer lengths. The last player who is able to break one of
    the pieces wins. Alice gets to start, as she is the younger of
    the two.</p>
<p>Of course, you already have the game figured out in your
    head. Assuming Bob plays optimally, can Alice win the game? And
    if so, what move should she make first?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>A line containing a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq n\leq 10^9$</span>, the length of
        the branch.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>On the first line print the name of the person who wins,
        <tt class="ttfamily">Alice</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">Bob</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Alice can win, print the length of a piece of branch
        Alice can break off as a winning move. This should be an
        integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>,
        inclusive.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are multiple valid solutions, you may output any
    one of them.</p>
