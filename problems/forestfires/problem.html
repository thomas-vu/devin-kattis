<p>Fires can spread in a forest more easily if the trees in the
    forest are densely packed – it makes it easy for the fire to
    jump from tree to tree. Write a forest fire simulator which
    ‘grows’ a forest tree-by-tree. As the forest grows, your
    simulator should answer queries about whether a fire starting
    at tree <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> can spread to
    tree <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (where trees
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> may vary with each query).</p>
<p>The forest is modeled as a grid of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$100 \times 100$</span>, where each grid
    square can hold exactly one tree. The bottom-left grid square
    is <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span> and the
    top-right is at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(99,99)$</span>.
    Each square has an associated number, with square at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> numbered
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100 x + y$</span>.</p>
<p>Fire spreads directly from tree <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> if <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> is on fire and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> is adjacent vertically or
    horizontally to <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>. Fire
    continues to spread until has reached all the trees it can
    reach in the forest. Note that we are only interested in
    whether a fire is able to reach from tree <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> to tree <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, but we do not actually remove any
    trees related to the query.</p>
<p>The simulator relies on a random number generator, which is
    defined as:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ r \leftarrow (r
    * 5\, 171 + 13\, 297) \mod 50\, 021 \]</span>
<p>where each simulation starts with a different ‘seed’ for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>. Every time a random
    number is needed, including the first time, this generator is
    used to generate a new value for <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>.</p>
<p>Given a seed <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and
    length of simulation <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>,
    the simulator should proceed as follows:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Initialize: let <span class="tex2jax_process">$i
        \leftarrow 0$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stopping condition: if <span class="tex2jax_process">$i
        \geq n$</span>, then stop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Place a tree: choose a random square <span class="tex2jax_process">$m \leftarrow r \mod 10\, 000$</span>
        from the random number generator. If the square numbered
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is occupied by a
        tree, generate another value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> in the same way. Keep doing
        this until <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is for
        an unoccupied square. Place a tree at square <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, and call this tree
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>: compute
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$a \leftarrow r\mod
        (i+1)$</span>, and let <span class="tex2jax_process">$A
        \leftarrow t_ a$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>: compute
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$b \leftarrow r\mod
        (i+1)$</span>, and let <span class="tex2jax_process">$B
        \leftarrow t_ b$</span>. It is okay if <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> represent the same tree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fire query: discover whether a fire started at tree
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> can burn to tree
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increment: let <span class="tex2jax_process">$i
        \leftarrow i + 1$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loop: go back to step 2.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Report a summary of the fire queries every <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> iterations during the
    simulation.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> test cases. Each test case is a
    line containing two integer values <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le r &lt; 50\, 021$</span>, representing
    the seed value of the random number generator, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n \le 10\, 000$</span>, representing
    the number of times the main simulation loop should execute.
    Also, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is a multiple of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>. Input ends at end
    of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, after each set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> iterations, output the number of
    fire queries (step <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>
    above) which succeeded. That is, the first block is between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i=0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$i=99$</span>, the second block is between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i=100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$i=199$</span>, etc.</p>
