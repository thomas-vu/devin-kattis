<p>A ferry is being loaded with cars, and there’s a long line
    of cars queued up to enter the ferry. Since the time between
    the ferry’s departures is very long, it’s important that as
    many cars as possible can board the ferry. The shipping
    company, Crappy Shippers Inc., has lately recieved a large
    number of complaints from the organization <em>Angry Young
    Algorithmicists</em>, stating that the packing of the cars on
    the ferry is <em>“bad”</em>, <em>“suboptimal”</em>,
    <em>“heuristical”</em> and <em>“unsustainable”</em>. The CEO of
    the company, Ernst. I. S. Crappy confirms that they have been
    sloppy about packing the ferry, and has just made a statement
    that they will always pack the ferry with as many cars as
    possible. Ernst said nothing about how they will do this, but
    there’s a rumor floating around that they have requested the
    assistance of the Swedish Olympiad in Informatics.</p>
<p>The ferry has four lanes, where each lane is a fixed length
    which is the same for all the lanes. A line of cars are waiting
    in a queue to board the ferry, and they will board it in their
    queuing order. The staff of the shipping company can decide
    what lane a car should enter (if it fits). When a car can’t fit
    in any of the lanes, the ferry is considered full (this means
    that no car in the queue is ever skipped, even if a later car
    could fit in some lane). It’s also important that there’s a one
    meter safety margin between cars adjacent in the same lane.</p>
<p>Given the length of the ferry and the lengths of the cars in
    the queue, help the staff compute the maximum number of cars
    that can board the ferry.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: An example of an optimal packing of the
        ferry. The ferry is <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> meters long, and the lengths
        of the cars in the queue are <span class="tex2jax_process">$2, 1, 2, 5, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2$</span>, of
        which only the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> could fit the ferry.
      </div>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$N
    \le 200$</span>), the number of cars. The second line contains
    the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$L \le 60$</span>), the length
    of the lanes. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers on a line, where each
    integer is the length of a car in the same order that they’re
    queuing in. Each car is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> meters long, and does not exceed
    the length of the ferry.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer: the maximum number of cars that can
    board the ferry.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>Your solution will be tested on a set of test case groups.
    To get the points for a group, you need to pass all the test
    cases in the group.</p>
