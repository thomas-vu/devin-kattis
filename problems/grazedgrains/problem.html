<div class="problembody">
<p>This year, there have been unusually many UFO sightings
    reported. Nobody knows if they are caused by optical illusions,
    weather phenomena, or secret technology being tested by foreign
    powers (terrestrial or not). UFO enthusiasts across the world
    rejoice, and speculations run wild. But someone who is not
    impressed is the farmer Celeste. Her large grain field has
    repeatedly been used as a landing site by the UFOs, destroying
    her crops. Celeste would like to bring whoever is responsible
    to justice, but before she can do so she must assess the damage
    caused by the unidentified flying offenders.</p>
<p>In total <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> circular
    UFOs have landed in Celesteâ€™s field. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th one left a crop circle which
    destroyed all crops within radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i$</span> of the point <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i, y_ i$</span>. The field is very large,
    so you can assume that it extends infinitely in all directions.
    Your task is to estimate the total area of crops destroyed by
    the UFOs. Celeste only needs a rough estimate of the true
    answer, and your answer will be counted as correct if its
    relative error is less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\%
    $</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 10$</span>), the number of UFOs. Then follow
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th of which contains
    the three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x_ i, y_ i \leq 10$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq r_ i \leq 10$</span>),
    describing the crop circle left by the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th UFO.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the total area covered by the crop circles in the
    input, with a relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/10$</span>.</p>
