<p>Thousands of planets outside the Solar System have been
    discovered in recent years. An important factor for potential
    life support is the availability of liquid water. Detecting
    water on faraway planets is not easy. For rotating planets, a
    brand-new technology using relativistic quantum-polarized
    spectroscopy can help. It works as follows (this is a
    simplified description as only three people on <em>this</em>
    planet understand how it really works).</p>

</div>Assume the telescope shows the planet such that its
    rotating axis is vertical and its equator is horizontal. Only
    the vertical line at the center of the image (the line that
    covers the rotating axis) is analyzed, because it provides the
    highest resolution of the planet’s surface.
    <p>The analysis proceeds in steps of <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> degrees. In one step, data is
    aggregated while the planet rotates by <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> degrees, so each step gives
    information about a slice of <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> degrees of the planet’s surface.
    The image is split into <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> segments of equal height, which
    are analyzed separately. So the slice of <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> degrees is partitioned into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> areas <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_1, \dots , A_ n$</span>. For each area
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span>, image analysis
    produces a number that gives the percentage of <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> covered by water. The areas
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> for one step are
    highlighted in the diagram on the right.</p>
<p>You may assume the planet’s surface is a sphere. This means
    each area <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_2, \dots ,
    A_{n-1}$</span> is a spherical quadrilateral: it has four
    vertices, two sides parallel to the equator (that is, in planes
    parallel to the equator’s plane) and two sides on great circles
    through the planet’s poles, where the great circles are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> degrees apart. At
    either pole, two of the four vertices collapse into the pole,
    so <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ n$</span> are spherical triangles with
    only one side parallel to the equator. Due to the curvature of
    the surface, sides that are parallel to the equator are longer
    if they are closer to the equator, while sides on great circles
    are longer if they are closer to the poles.</p>
<p>The above process is repeated for the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> degrees of rotation, and so on, a
    total number of <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> times,
    until the whole surface of the planet has been covered (that
    is, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m d = 360$</span> degrees).
    Your task is to compute the percentage of the planet’s surface
    covered by water from the given data.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n, m \leq 1000$</span>). Each of the following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i,j}$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a_{i,j} \leq 100$</span> for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq n$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq j \leq m$</span>). Each
    column of this matrix describes the measurements for a single
    step, that is, a rotation by <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> degrees. The number <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i,j}$</span> is the percentage of area
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> that is covered by
    water in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^\mathrm
    {th}$</span> step.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the percentage of the planet’s surface covered by
    water. Your answer should have an absolute error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
