<p>A piano tuner indeed has a hard time earning his living.
    (Un)fortunately, most people want their pianos tuned only when
    they move to a new place, and thus also someone to help them
    move the piano. Therefore, quite a few piano -tuners combine
    their profession with lifting and transporting pianos. However,
    as you might guess, they are not all that keen on doing a lot
    of heavy-weight carrying in a day, and they certainly don’t
    want to work weekends! In the city of Hampstead, the small
    group of piano tuners have joined forces, and they help each
    other by taking turns in moving the pianos. No piano tuner
    transports more than one piano a day under any circumstance,
    and they always work in pairs.</p>
<p>As with most craftsmen, you seldom get to know precisely
    when the job you request will be carried out. Instead, when
    ordering a piano move, you are given an arbitrary long time
    interval containing your desired moving day, during which your
    piano is guaranteed to be moved by the piano tuners. This
    strategy often makes the scheduling task easy, but this time
    they just might have put themselves in some trouble. During the
    last days, the piano tuners have received a lot of piano move
    orders for the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>
    days, and they are afraid that even if they work weekends they
    cannot keep their promises. To help them see if this is the
    case, and to avoid it in the future, they would like a computer
    program testing different scenarios.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line is a single positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \le 100$</span>, specifying the number of
    test scenarios to follow. Each scenario begin with two positive
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> on a line of their
    own, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m \le 1000$</span>, telling
    the number of pianos to be moved, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p \le 2000$</span> the number of piano
    tuners. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines, each containing a piano move order on the format of two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_ i$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le b_ i \le e_ i \le 100$</span> meaning
    that between the beginning of day <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> and the end of day <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_ i$</span>, the piano <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> must be moved. Day 1 is always a
    Monday, 2 a Tuesday and so on.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test scenario, output the text “<tt class="ttfamily">serious trouble</tt>” if the list of piano move
    orders cannot be executed as promised even if all the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> pianotuners worked
    every day, the text “<tt class="ttfamily">weekend work</tt>” if
    at least two piano tuners have to work some Saturday or Sunday,
    or the text “<tt class="ttfamily">fine</tt>” if it is possible
    to carry out all the moves during the five working days of the
    weeks.</p>
