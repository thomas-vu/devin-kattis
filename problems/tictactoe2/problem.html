<div class="problembody">
<p>Tic Tac Toe is a child’s game played on a <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> grid. One player, X, starts by
    placing an X at an unoccupied grid position. Then the other
    player, O, places an O at an unoccupied grid position. Play
    alternates between X and O until the grid is filled or one
    player’s symbols occupy an entire line (vertical, horizontal,
    or diagonal) in the grid.</p>
<p>We will denote the initial empty Tic Tac Toe grid with nine
    dots. Whenever X or O plays we fill in an X or an O in the
    appropriate position. The example below illustrates each grid
    configuration from the beginning to the end of a game in which
    X wins.</p>
<pre>
...  X..  X.O  X.O  X.O  X.O  X.O  X.O
...  ...  ...  ...  .O.  .O.  OO.  OO.
...  ...  ...  ..X  ..X  X.X  X.X  XXX
</pre>
<p>Your job is to read a grid and to determine whether or not
    it could possibly be part of a valid Tic Tac Toe game. That is,
    is there a series of plays that can yield this grid somewhere
    between the start and end of the game?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 150$</span>, the number of test
    cases. <span class="tex2jax_process">$4N-1$</span> lines
    follow, specifying <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    grid configurations separated by empty lines.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case print “<tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt>” or
    “<tt class="ttfamily">no</tt>” on a line by itself, indicating
    whether or not the configuration could be part of a Tic Tac Toe
    game.</p>
