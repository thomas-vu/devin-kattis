<p>Mount Snowdon, the tallest place in Wales, is a major
    attraction for mountain bikers far and wide. To take advantage
    of the popularity of this thrilling sport, an enterprising new
    venture plans to open several new bike repair shops throughout
    the rolling foothills.</p>
<p>The cunning small business owner’s financial success relates
    directly to the velocity of the average biker: the faster a
    biker is going at the foot of the hill the more likely they are
    to encounter a problem and have to walk — or sometimes limp —
    into the shop.</p>
<p>Snowdon, like most mountains, has a very angular sort of
    shape. In fact, the profile of the mountain can be represented
    as <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> connected line
    segments pointing downward at various angles, each starting
    where the last left off. Given this highly scientific
    representation of the landscape, we need to find the likely
    speeds of bikers given that they may start off from the top of
    any of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    segments.</p>
<p>As we all know, a biker on a <span class="tex2jax_process">$\theta $</span>-degree slope from the
    vertical will accelerate at a rate of precisely <span class="tex2jax_process">$g \cdot \cos (\theta ) \; \; \textrm{m}
    \textrm{s}^{-2}$</span> along the slope.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 4$</span>), the number of
        line segments making up the mountain, followed by a space
        and then a real number <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le g \le 100$</span>), the
        coefficient of acceleration due to gravity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> more lines each
        containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_
        i$</span> and then <span class="tex2jax_process">$\theta _
        i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le D \le 10^4;
        1 \le \theta \le 89$</span>): the sloped distance in metres
        and absolute angle in degrees of this line segment from the
        vertical respectively. The segments are ordered from the
        top of the hill to its bottom.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    of output should contain one real number: the velocity of a
    biker starting at the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text
    {th}}$</span>-most segment from the top and finishing at the
    foot of the mountain.</p>
<p>Answers will be judged as correct if they are printed to
    within an absolute or relative difference of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> from their exact values.</p>
