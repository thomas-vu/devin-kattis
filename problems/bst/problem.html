<p>A binary search tree is a tree in which every node has at
    most two children nodes (a left and a right child). Each node
    has an integer written inside it. If the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is written inside a node, then the
    numbers in its left subtree are less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and the numbers in its right
    subtree are greater than X. You will be given a sequence of
    integers between 1 and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (inclusive) such that each number appears in the sequence
    exactly once. You are to create a binary search tree from the
    sequence, putting the first number in the root node and
    inserting every other number in order.</p>
<p>When inserting a new number <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> in a tree, you first traverse the
    tree as if you were searching for <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>. When you arrive at a node
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z$</span> such that you canâ€™t
    continue searching for <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, you put <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> as a left or right son of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z$</span> depending on if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z&gt;Y$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z&lt;Y$</span>, so that after the insertion
    the tree will still be a binary search tree. After the
    insertion you add the depth of <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> to a counter <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> and print the value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>. The counter
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> is set to <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> in the beginning.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq N \leq 300\, 000)$</span>, the length of the sequence.</p>
<p>The remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contain the numbers in the sequence, integers in the interval
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1, N]$</span>. The numbers will
    be distinct.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers
    each on its own line, the values of the counter <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> after each number is inserted into
    the tree.</p>
