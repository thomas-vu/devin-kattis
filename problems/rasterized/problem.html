<div class="problembody">
<p>Tomáš is a computer graphics student. He has a homework
    which is very easy for him. He is supposed to make a program
    that draws a line from point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,
    0)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a, b)$</span>,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> are positive integers given as the
    input.</p>
<p>He uses the following algorithm. He divides the plane into
    squares <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\times 1$</span> –
    these squares are pixels. When the line from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 0)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a, b)$</span> intersects a square <em>in
    more than one point</em>, the square (pixel) will be painted
    black and otherwise it will be painted white.</p>

<p>Tomáš did his homework in 30 minutes and now he is
    interested in a slightly different problem. Given an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, for how many
    different inputs does his algorithm produce exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> black pixels?</p>
<p>More precisely, he is only interested in lines beginning in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 0)$</span> and ending in
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>), where both <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> are positive integers. Given
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, find out how many of
    these lines will produce exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> black pixels.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input file contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le T \le 60$</span>
    specifying the number of test cases.</p>
<p>Each test case looks as follows. The one and only line
    contains a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 10^{14}$</span>. You can assume that number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> has at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> divisors.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case output one line with one integer – the
    number of lines that use exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> black pixels.</p>
