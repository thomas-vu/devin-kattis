<div class="problembody">
<p>A town is often divided into zones, e.g, industrial zones,
    commercial zones, and residential zones. If some residential
    zone is very far from all commercial zones, then the people
    living there will have a long journey whenever they want to do
    some shopping, and this is undesirable.</p>
<p>The input will consist of an <span class="tex2jax_process">$n\times n$</span> grid of square zones. Each
    zone is labeled <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt> (residential),
    <tt class="ttfamily">2</tt> (industrial), or <tt class="ttfamily">3</tt> (commercial). When travelling from one zone
    to another you are allowed to move north, east, south or west,
    and the distance travelled is the number of zone boundaries you
    traverse. So the distance between two adjacent zones is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and the distance from
    the zone in square <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,1)$</span>
    (the most south-westerly zone) to the zone in square
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2,3)$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> (one step east and two steps
    north). You may never move off the grid.</p>
<p>Your task is to find the longest distance one has to travel
    from a residential zone to get to the commercial zone closest
    to that residential zone.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq n\leq 1500$</span>, followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> giving the map of the
    city zones as an <span class="tex2jax_process">$n\times
    n$</span> matrix where each entry is <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">2</tt>, or <tt class="ttfamily">3</tt> depending on zone type. You can assume that
    the city has zones of all three types.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, the largest distance from a
    residential zone to its closest commercial zone.</p>
