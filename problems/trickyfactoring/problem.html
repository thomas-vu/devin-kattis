<div class="problembody">
<p>Ms. Alice was working on making some factoring homework for
    her students last week, where the students get questions in the
    form of <span class="tex2jax_process">$ax^2+bx+c$</span>, and
    must rewrite the expression in the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$(dx+ e)(fx + g)$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a,b,c,d,e,f,g$</span> are integers. However,
    last night the ZomBs invaded her house! The next day, when Ms.
    Alice woke up, she found that the ZomBs had eaten all the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>s! They had eaten the
    middle number on all her factoring questions that she spent all
    week making for her students. Ms. Alice decided that instead of
    remaking all her questions, she would just ask her students how
    many possible values there are for <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> that would make the expression
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$ax^2+bx+c$</span>
    factorable.</p>
<p>The expression <span class="tex2jax_process">$ax^2+bx+c$</span> is factorable if and only
    if the expression <span class="tex2jax_process">$ax^2+bx+c$</span> is able to be successfully
    rewritten in the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$(dx+ e)(fx
    + g)$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a,b,c,d,e,f,g$</span> are integers.</p>
<p>As one of Ms. Aliceâ€™s students, you must come up with a
    solution to her tricky new problem!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two space separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0&lt;a,c\leq 10^{16}$</span>. It
    is guaranteed that all prime factors of <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> are less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The number of possible integer values <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> that would make <span class="tex2jax_process">$ax^2+bx+c$</span> factorable.</p>
