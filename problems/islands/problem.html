<p>Given a sequence of integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, a_3, \ldots , a_ n$</span>, an
    island in the sequence is a contiguous subsequence for which
    each element is greater than the elements immediately before
    and after the subsequence. In the examples below, each island
    in the sequence has a bracket below it. The bracket for an
    island contained within another island is below the bracket of
    the containing island.</p>

<p>Write a program that takes as input a sequence of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> non-negative integers
    and outputs the number of islands in the sequence.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 1000$</span>), which is the
    number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be
    processed identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> non-negative integers separated
    by a single space. The first and last integers in the sequence
    will be 0.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is one line of output. The single
    output line consists of the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single space
    followed by the number of islands in the sequence.</p>
