<p>Santa Klas is in trouble! The ACM (Aerodynamic Christmas
    Machines) has called you in to be their subject matter expert
    for the current situation.</p>
<p>Santa Klas recently got himself a new bunch of reindeers,
    that would boost his speed even more while travelling across
    the sky. The reindeers even came with an autopilot, so Santa
    Klas calmly took off into the sky, adjusted his heading,
    activated his autopilot and fell asleep.</p>
<p>Santa Klas has been playing too much flight simulator
    computer games lately, and he is certain that when the
    autopilot is activated, the ship he is flying in will hold
    altitude and course. This is not the case. The autopilot on his
    new reindeers only guarantee that the heading is the same, and
    the vertical angle is kept the same. This means that if Santa
    Klas’ ship is currently heading for the ground, he will crash
    if he doesn’t wake up soon enough! If the ship isn’t pointing
    to the ground, Santa Klas will exit the atmosphere. But that’s
    fine, he’s done that before.</p>
<p>The ACM has given you Santa Klas’ angle between his course
    and the ground and altitude in meters. Help them determine how
    much time they have to wake him up, or if Santa Klas will exit
    the atmosphere. Santa Klas always flies with a speed of one
    meter per second (yeah, it takes him a while to round the
    earth).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The only line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le H \le 10\, 000 , 0 \le v \le
    359$</span>, Santa Klas’ current altitude and his current angle
    in degrees from the horizon, i.e. if <span class="tex2jax_process">$v = 0$</span> then Santa Klas is flying with
    constant altitude (since the earth is flat), and is therefore
    safe. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$v = 90$</span>, then
    Santa Klas is heading straight for the stars.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output should consist of one single integer: the number of
    whole seconds that the ACM have to safely wake Santa Klas up,
    so that he can adjust his course. You may assume that Santa
    Klas is infinitely fast at adjusting it after waking up, as the
    flight simulator professional he is. If Santa Klas is not
    heading for the ground, just print the word "<tt class="ttfamily">safe</tt>" on a single line instead.</p>
