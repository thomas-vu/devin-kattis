<div class="problembody">
<p>Mirko has found an old chessboard and a set of pieces in his
    attic. Unfortunately, the set contains only white pieces, and
    apparently an incorrect number of them. A set of pieces
    <b class="bfseries">should</b> contain:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One king</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One queen</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two rooks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two bishops</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two knights</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eight pawns</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mirko would like to know how many pieces of each type he
    should <b class="bfseries">add or remove</b> to make a valid
    set.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> integers on a single line, each
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> (inclusive). The
    numbers are, in order, the numbers of kings, queens, rooks,
    bishops, knights and pawns in the set Mirko found.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output should consist of <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> integers on a single line; the
    number of pieces of each type Mirko should add or remove. If a
    number is positive, Mirko needs to add that many pieces. If a
    number is negative, Mirko needs to remove pieces.</p>
