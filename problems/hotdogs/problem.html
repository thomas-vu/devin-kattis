<div class="problembody">
<p>The two friends Barack and Mitt have both decided to set up
    their own hot dog stand in Manhattan. They wish to find the two
    optimal locations for their stands.</p>
<p>First of all, they both want to put their stand at an
    intersection, since that gives them maximum exposure. Also,
    this being Manhattan, there are already quite a few stands in
    the city, also at intersections. If they put up a stand close
    to another (or each other’s) stand, they might not get that
    many customers. They would therefore like to put their stands
    as far from other stands as possible.</p>
<p>We model Manhattan as a finite square grid, consisting of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> vertical streets and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> horizontal streets.
    The vertical streets run from <span class="tex2jax_process">$x=0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$x=w-1$</span>, while horizontal streets run
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$y=0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$y=h-1$</span>. All pairs of consecutive
    parallel streets are separated by the same distance, which we
    set as the unit distance. The distance between two
    intersections <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1)$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2, y_2)$</span> is then
    given by <span class="tex2jax_process">$|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 -
    y_2|$</span>.</p>
<p>We indicate an intersection’s suitability by its
    <em>privacy</em>, which is the minimum of all distances from
    this intersection to all other hot dog stands. Barack and Mitt
    would like to find two intersections with the maximum amount of
    privacy, i.e. such that the smallest of the two privacies
    is as large as possible. Note that the privacy of Barack’s
    location can be determined by the distance to Mitt’s location
    and vice versa.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with three space-separated integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq w, h \leq 1\,
        000$</span>): the number of hot dog stands already in place
        and the number of vertical and horizontal streets,
        respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        with two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x_ i &lt; w$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq y_ i &lt; h$</span>):
        the intersection where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th hot dog stand is
        located.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All hot dog stands are at different intersections. At least
    two intersections do not contain a stand.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with one integer: the maximum privacy that
        Barack and Mitt can both obtain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
