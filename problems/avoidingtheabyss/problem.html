        This picture represents sample 1. The path taken avoids the
        hidden pool, but based on the information given it could
        also have intersected it. So the sample solution was quite
        lucky here.
      </div>
</div>
<p>You are standing on a point with integer coordinates
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_s, y_s)$</span>. You want to
    walk to the point with integer coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_t, y_t)$</span>. To do this, you can walk
    along a sequence of line segments. But there is a swimming pool
    in your way. The swimming pool is an axis aligned rectangle
    whose lower left corner is on the point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_l, y_l)$</span> and the upper right
    corner is on the point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_r,
    y_r)$</span>. You cannot ever cross the swimming pool, not even
    on the border. However, it is dark and you do not know the
    coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_l, y_l)$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_r, y_r)$</span>. Instead,
    you threw a rock into the pool which revealed that the point
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_p, y_p)$</span> is in the
    pool (or on the boundary).</p>
<p>Find a way to walk from the start to the end point along a
    sequence of line segments, so that you never cross the swimming
    pool.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_s$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^4 \leq x_s, y_s \leq 10^4$</span>).</p>
<p>The second line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_t$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^4 \leq x_t, y_t \leq 10^4$</span>).</p>
<p>The third line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^4 \leq x_p, y_p \leq 10^4$</span>).</p>
<p>The problem is not adaptive, i.e. for every test case there
    exist four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_l, y_l,
    x_r, y_r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^4 \leq x_l
    &lt; x_r \leq 10^4$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^4 \leq y_l &lt; y_r \leq 10^4$</span>)
    that constitute a swimming pool. The start and end points are
    always strictly outside the swimming pool, and the point
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_p,y_p)$</span> is inside (or
    on the border). The start and end points are always distinct.
    Note that the problem is technically interactive, so the input
    will not contain an EOF character.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>First, print one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq N \leq 10$</span>), the number of points in between the
    start and end point that you want to visit. Then, print
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th containing two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_i, y_i$</span>. These
    coordinates must satisfy <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^9
    \leq x_i, y_i \leq 10^9$</span>. Note that these are not the
    same bounds than on the other coordinates.</p>
<p>This means that you will walk along straight line segments
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_s, y_s), (x_1, y_1),
    \dots , (x_N, y_N), (x_t, y_t)$</span> such that none of the
    line segments touch the swimming pool. It can be proven that a
    solution always exists.</p>
