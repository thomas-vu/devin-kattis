<p>Johan has a really boring job at the airport. It is his duty
    to make sure no bags collide when sliding onto the circular
    conveyor belt in the luggage pick-up zone. All pieces of
    luggage are loaded onto a straight conveyer belt which ends
    above the circular conveyor belt. Johan is then manually
    varying the speed of the straight conveyor so that no
    collisions occur. He would rather set a constant speed so that
    he can go to the fika room. There is a sensor at the start of
    the long conveyor belt so that he can get the positions of all
    pieces of luggage into his computer. Now all he needs is a
    program giving him the maximum speed that will avoid all
    collisions.</p>
<p>The circular conveyor belt moves at a constant speed of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> m/s. If a piece
    of luggage is dropped on the circular belt within one meter of
    the position of another piece of luggage they may collide, so
    this should be avoided. Some bags might be picked up on the
    first round, but you can not know in advance which will be
    left. The straight conveyor can be set to any speed between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.1$</span> m/s and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> m/s.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq L \leq 1\, 000$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the number of pieces of luggage
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> is the length of
    the circular conveyor belt in meters. The second line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> unique space-separated
    numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x_ i \leq 1\,
    000$</span>) with two digits after the decimal point, denoting
    luggage positions in meters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum speed <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> in m/s (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0.1 \leq v \leq 10$</span>) that makes sure
    no collisions will occur, or “<tt>no fika</tt>” if there is no
    such speed. The answer is considered correct if it has an
    absolute error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-9}$</span>.</p>
<p>You may assume that when an optimal <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> exists, each speed in the interval
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[v - 10^{-9}, v]$</span> will
    also be a valid speed.</p>
