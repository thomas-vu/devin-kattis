<p>Dominick Cobb and Arthur are “extractors" who perform
    corporate espionage. Using experimental military technology
    that gives them access to shared dream worlds, they infiltrate
    their targets’ subconscious to extract valuable information.
    Cobb and his entourage are contacted by a mysterious Japanese
    syndicate and given a seemingly impossible task: instead of
    extracting information, do the opposite – plant a new idea in
    the target’s mind.<br/></p>
<p>Cobb notes that when using dream-sharing technology, time
    slows down by different factors depending on whose dream is
    being entered. Their target is to convince Cepshun, the heir of
    an energy conglomerate, to dissolve his father’s company.
    Before Cobb starts, he notes that it would be important to
    figure out the passage of time to ensure that the operation can
    be completed smoothly.<br/></p>
<p>In Cepshun’s dreams, there are multiple different layers of
    consciousness, each of which controls a different area of
    Cepshun’s dreams and memories. Cobb needs to move between
    several dreams to reach his destination dream – some of them
    belonging to Cepshun, and some of them belonging to his
    entourage. The factor by which time slows down on each level is
    best visualized by all of the positive integers arranged in an
    infinite triangle, where the first row has the single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, the second row has
    the next two integers, the third row has the next three, and so
    forth. The first <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>
    levels are depicted below:</p>
<pre>
      1
     2 3
    4 5 6
   7 8 9 10
    etc...
</pre>
<p>The initial time factor for reality is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. To enter the next dream level,
    Cobb can either descend left (into a dream by Cepshun) or right
    (into a dream by his entourage). For example, if he descends
    right, left, right, then he’ll end up at dreams with time
    factors of <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, and finally
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>. Note the interesting
    property that for any pair of whole numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, Cobb will always end up on the
    same time factor if he moves left <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> times total and right <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> times total, regardless of the
    order in which he makes the moves.<br/></p>
<p>Cobb wants to know the slowness of time inside his target
    dream, which he can reach by descending left <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> times and right <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> times.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 100$</span>), the number of
    test cases.<br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines follow, each of
    which is a test case consisting of two space-separated
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq L, R \leq 10^{9}$</span>), specifying
    the number of times Cobb needs to descend left and right,
    respectively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print, on a separate line, the factor by
    which time slows down in the target’s dream at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(L, R)$</span>.<br/>
    Note: the answer can be large, and may not necessarily fit in a
    32-bit integer.<br/></p>
