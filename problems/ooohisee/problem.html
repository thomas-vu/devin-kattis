<div class="problembody">
<p>Captain O’Capten has hidden some treasure and created a map
    to mark where it is buried. Rather than using ‘X’ to mark the
    spot, he has decided to obfuscate the location by using a grid
    of uppercase <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt> (the letter <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt>) characters and <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>
    (the number <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>) characters. The
    treasure’s position is given by the location of a <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt> character surrounded on all sides by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt> characters. That is, a <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt> character with an <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt>
    immediately above, below, to the left, to the right, diagonally
    above to the left, diagonally above to the right, diagonally
    below to the left, and diagonally below to the right.</p>
<p>Captain O’Capten wants to recover the location of his
    treasure but he is finding his map hard to read (huh, go
    figure). Help Captain O’Capten find the location of his
    treasure, or exclaim <tt class="ttfamily">Oh no!</tt> if such a
    location is not marked on the map or there is more than one
    such location.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq r,c \leq 50$</span>), where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> indicates the number
    of rows and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> indicates
    the number of columns of characters in the map. Rows are
    numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, top to bottom, and
    columns are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, left to right.
    This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
    lines, each with <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>
    characters, where each character is either <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If there is no <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt> character
    surrounded on all sides by <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt>
    characters, then output one line consisting of the exclamation,
    <tt class="ttfamily">Oh no!</tt>. If there is more than one
    <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt> character surrounded on all sides
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt> characters, then output one line consisting
    of the exclamation, <tt class="ttfamily">Oh no! N
    locations</tt>, with the number of locations instead of
    <tt class="ttfamily">N</tt>. If there is exactly one <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt> character surrounded on all sides by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt> characters, then output one line containing
    two integers. The first integer is the index of the row of the
    <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt> character and the second integer is
    the index of the column of the <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>
    character.</p>
