<div class="problembody">
<p>Eddy is overseeing construction of some new slot machines.
    His slot machines consist of three wheels, each of which can
    show one of several different digits. When activated, each
    wheel shows a random digit. The goal is for all wheels to be
    able to show the digit <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>.</p>
<p>A slot machine is good if each wheel is capable of showing
    the digit <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>, and bad
    otherwise. For a given slot machine, determine if it is good or
    bad.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq n \leq 10)$</span>, which is the number of different
    digits on each wheel. Each wheel has the same number of
    digits.</p>
<p>Each of the next three lines contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> distinct digits (in the range from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>). These are the digits on each of
    the three wheels.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is <span class="tex2jax_process">$777$</span> if the slot machine is good,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> otherwise.</p>
