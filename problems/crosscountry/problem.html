<p>Charles Johnson is on his way to meet his very good friend
    Bernard Terrell. They are going on their bi-weekly skiing trip.
    Today Charles had forgot all about the Kvikk Lunsj and had to
    go back home to get it. This has left him very late, and to
    make things worse all the parking spots close to the meeting
    spot has been taken. Given the workout diary of Charles, could
    you help find the fastest path to the meeting spot?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of three
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, representing the number of
    intersections in the ski tracks networks, the index of the
    intersection where Charles parked his car and the index of the
    intersection where Charles agreed to meet Bernard.<br/>
    Then follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines.
    Each of the lines consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_{ij}$</span>. The integer on
    line <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and column
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> describes the time in
    minutes it takes for Charles to get from intersection
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to intersection
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should be a single line consisting of the minimum
    number of minutes Charles will have to use to get to the
    meeting point to share some Kvikk Lunsj with Bernard.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
