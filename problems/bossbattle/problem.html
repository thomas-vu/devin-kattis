<div class="problembody">
<p>You are stuck at a boss level of your favourite video game.
    The boss battle happens in a circular room with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> indestructible pillars arranged
    evenly around the room. The boss hides behind an unknown
    pillar. Then the two of you proceed in turns.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>First, in your turn, you can throw a bomb past one of
        the pillars. The bomb will defeat the boss if it is behind
        that pillar, or either of the adjacent pillars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, if the boss was not defeated, it may either stay
        where it is, or use its turn to move to a pillar that is
        adjacent to its current position. With the smoke of the
        explosion you cannot see this movement.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last time you tried to beat the boss you failed because
    you ran out of bombs. This time you want to gather enough bombs
    to make sure that whatever the boss does you will be able to
    beat it. What is the minimum number of bombs you need in order
    to defeat the boss in the worst case? See Figure 1 for an
    example.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: Example for <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=4$</span>. In this case <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> bombs are enough. Grey
          pillars represent pillars where the boss cannot be
