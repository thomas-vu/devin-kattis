        ”Don’t worry, everyone does bad on his tests.”
      </div>
</div>
<p>Professor Peggert is famous for his exams with low average /
    median scores and no extra credit. Despite this, his students’
    final grades (usually) turn out okay, as he boosts everyone’s
    score by grading on a curve. Professor Peggert determines final
    grades by choosing a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> and dividing each student’s score
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> to get a percentage
    representing that student’s grade. For example, if a student
    scored <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> on a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> point exam, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> is chosen to be
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, the student would
    have received a <span class="tex2jax_process">$5/K=50\%
    $</span>. He wants to choose a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> that satisfies the following
    conditions:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>At least a quarter of the class should receive a final
        grade of <span class="tex2jax_process">$90\% $</span> (A-)
        or better;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least half of the class should receive a final grade
        of <span class="tex2jax_process">$80\% $</span> (B-) or
        better;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At least three quarters of the class should receive a
        final grade of <span class="tex2jax_process">$70\% $</span>
        (C-) or better.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Professor Peggert doesn’t want to curve the grades too
    generously though, so he wants <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> to be as high as possible while
    satisfying the previous conditions. Note that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> chosen may be any positive
    integer, even if the chosen <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> results in some final grades being
    more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\% $</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N,T \leq 100\,
    000$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is
    the number of students and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> is the maximum possible score that
    a student can score on the test. Each of the following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains an
    individual student’s test score <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq T_ i \leq T$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ i$</span> is an integer.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing the highest number <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> that satisfies the conditions.
    Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> if no such
    number exists.</p>
