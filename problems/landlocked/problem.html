<div class="problembody">
<p>Canada is not a landlocked country: the country touches at
    least one ocean (in fact, it touches three).</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$46$</span>
    countries (including Bolivia and Mongolia, for example) which
    are landlocked. That is, they do not touch an ocean, but by
    going through one other country, an ocean can be reached. For
    example, a person in Mongolia can get to an ocean by passing
    through Russia.</p>
<p>Liechtenstein and Uzbekistan are the only two countries in
    the world which are land-landlocked. That is, not only are they
    land-locked, but all countries which surround these two
    countries are land-locked countries. Thus, one would have to
    pass through at least two different countries when leaving
    Uzbekistan before arriving at an ocean.</p>
<p>Your task is to determine how landlocked each country is on
    a given map. We say that a country is not landlocked (recorded
    as <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>) if it touches
    water in any adjacent cell in either a horizontal, vertical, or
    diagonal direction. If a country is landlocked, you must
    calculate the minimum number of borders that one must cross in
    order to travel from the country to water. Each step of such a
    journey must be to a cell that is adjacent in either a
    horizontal, vertical, or diagonal direction. Crossing a border
    is defined as taking a step from a cell in one country to an
    adjacent cell in a different country.</p>
<p>Note that countries may not be connected to themselves (as
    in a country formed of islands). In this case, the landlocked
    value for the country is the minimal of each connected region
    of the country.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N, M \leq 1\, 000$</span>).</p>
<p>On each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    capital letters. Each country will be represented by a unique
    letter, with the exception that the letter ‘<tt class="ttfamily">W</tt>’ is reserved to indicate the water in the
    oceans or seas that will be used to determine the how
    landlocked each country is.</p>
<h2>Output Specification</h2>
<p>The output consists of the country letter followed by a
    space, followed by the landlockedness for that particular
    country. Output should be in alphabetical order.</p>
