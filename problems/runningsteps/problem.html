<div class="problembody">
<p>The coach wants his team members to run up the stadium steps
    taking either one or two steps with each stride so that:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>The number of two step strides taken by each leg is the
        same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of one step strides taken by each leg is the
        same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of two step strides is no smaller than the
        number of one step strides.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Start with the left leg.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The coach wants to know for a given (necessarily even)
    number of steps how many different ways there are to run the
    steps and satisfy his rules.</p>
<p>For example, with six steps (three for each leg), there are
    4 possibilities:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
      2<b class="bfseries">2</b>1<b class="bfseries">1</b>,
      2<b class="bfseries">1</b>1<b class="bfseries">2</b>,
      1<b class="bfseries">2</b>2<b class="bfseries">1</b>,
      1<b class="bfseries">1</b>2<b class="bfseries">2</b> (right
      leg strides are in <b class="bfseries">highlighted</b> type)
    </blockquote>
<p>With eight steps (four for each leg) there is only one
    possibility since there must be at least as many two step
    strides as one step strides:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
      2<b class="bfseries">2</b>2<b class="bfseries">2</b>
</blockquote>
<p>For this problem, you will write a program that calculates
    the number of different ways there are to run the steps that
    satisfy the coach’s four criteria.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 1000$</span>), which is the
    number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be
    processed identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by an even integer which
    is the total number of steps to be run, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le S \le 100$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is a single line of output. The
    single output line consists of the data set number,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single
    space followed by the number of different ways of running the
    steps that satisfy the coach’s four criteria.</p>
