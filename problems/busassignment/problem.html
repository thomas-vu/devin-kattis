<p>The Institution for Carrying People Carefully is responsible
    for managing the famous Line Bus in Line Town. The Line Bus
    goes through <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> stops
    conveniently numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. At stop <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_i$</span> people first get off the bus.
    Then, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_i$</span> people get on
    the bus. The bus starts out empty at stop <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and then goes through the stops in
    numerically increasing order, eventually stopping at stop
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> where the bus
    empties.</p>
<p>When someone rides the Line Bus, they must be seated. A bus
    with capacity <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> has
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> seats for
    passengers. Each rider of the Line Bus occupies exactly one
    seat. The driver of the Line Bus is not counted. The
    Institution for Carrying People Carefully wants to know what is
    the minimum capacity bus needed to run the Line Bus.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2
    \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0 \le a_i, b_i \le 10^9)$</span>. It is
    guaranteed that at least one person boards the bus, at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> people board the
    bus over all stops, and that the bus will empty at stop
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the minimum capacity bus needed to
    run the Line Bus.</p>
