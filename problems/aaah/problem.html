<p>Jon Marius shouted too much at the recent Justin Bieber
    concert, and now needs to go to the doctor because of his sore
    throat. The doctor’s instructions are to say “aaah”.
    Unfortunately, the doctors sometimes need Jon Marius to say
    “aaah” for a while, which Jon Marius has never been good at.
    Each doctor requires a certain <em>level</em> of “aah” – some
    require “aaaaaah”, while others can actually diagnose his
    throat with just an “h”. (They often diagnose wrongly, but that
    is beyond the scope of this problem.) Since Jon Marius does not
    want to go to a doctor and have his time wasted, he wants to
    compare how long he manages to hold the “aaah” with the
    doctor’s requirements. (After all, who wants to be all like
    “aaah” when the doctor wants you to go “aaaaaah”?)</p>
<p>Each day Jon Marius calls up a different doctor and asks
    them how long his “aaah” has to be. Find out if Jon Marius
    would waste his time going to the given doctor.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two lines. The first line is the
    “aaah” Jon Marius is able to say that day. The second line is
    the “aah” the doctor wants to hear. Only lowercase ’a’ and ’h’
    will be used in the input, and each line will contain between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$999$</span> ’a’s, inclusive, followed by a
    single ’h’.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “<tt class="tt">go</tt>” if Jon Marius can go to that
    doctor, and output “<tt class="tt">no</tt>” otherwise.</p>
