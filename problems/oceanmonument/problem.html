        Elder Guardian
      </div>
</div>
<p>Steve has stumbled across an ocean monument and would like
    to raid it. He has put on his best set of armor and brought his
    favorite trident in search of the rumored sponge room.<br/></p>
<p>The monument is protected by a lot of angry guardians and
    elder guardians. The mobs are very strong, and Steve has found
    that each time he enters the monument, he can either kill up to
    two guardians or exactly one elder guardian before having to
    retreat to heal. However, each time he retreats, a new guardian
    spawns in the monument. Luckily, elder guardians never
    respawn.</p>
<p>Steve will need to slay all the mobs in the monument before
    it is safe for him to loot it. He wants to kill the mobs in an
    optimal way, such that he minimizes the total number of trips
    to the monument required. Write a program that will help him
    figure out the number of such optimal orders he can choose
    from.<br/></p>
<p>For example, if there were initially <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> guardian and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> elder guardians in the monument,
    there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> optimal
    orders that minimize the number of trips required: he could
    either kill an elder guardian in both of the first two trips
    and kill two guardians in the next two trips, or he could kill
    an elder guardian in the first trip, kill two guardians in the
    second trip, kill the second elder guardian in the third trip,
    and kill two guardians in the fourth trip.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq t \leq 500$</span>, giving the number
    of test cases to follow. Each case consists of one line
    containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq
    g,e \leq 20$</span>, the number of guardians and elder
    guardians respectively that are in the monument the first time
    Steve enters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing a single
    number, the number of optimal orders in which Steve can kill
    the mobs.</p>
