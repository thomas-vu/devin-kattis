<p>Can you believe school has already started? It seems like we
    were just finishing last semester. Last semester was tough
    because the administration had a hard time keeping records of
    all the students in order, which slowed everything down. This
    year, they are going to be on top of things. They have
    recognized that you have the skills to help them get into shape
    with your programming ability, and you have volunteered to
    help. You recognize that the key to getting to student records
    quickly is having them in a sorted order. However, they don’t
    really have to be perfectly sorted, just so long as they are
    sort-of sorted.</p>
<p>Write a program that sorts a list of student last names, but
    the sort only uses the first two letters of the name. Nothing
    else in the name is used for sorting. However, if two names
    have the same first two letters, they should stay in the same
    order as in the input (this is known as a ‘stable sort’).
    Sorting is <em>case sensitive</em> based on ASCII order (with
    uppercase letters sorting before lowercase letters, i.e.,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A &lt; B &lt; \ldots &lt; Z &lt;
    a &lt; b &lt; \ldots &lt; z$</span>).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a sequence of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span> test cases. Each case starts
    with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 200$</span>. After this follow
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> last names made up of
    only letters (a–z, lowercase or uppercase), one name per line.
    Names have between <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> letters. Input ends
    when <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = 0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, print the last names in sort-of-sorted order,
    one per line. Print a blank line between cases.</p>
