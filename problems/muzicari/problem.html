<p>“The Drinking Musicians”, a widely known and popular folk
    group, are coming to your town. The musicians are known not
    only by their playing skills, but also their rough character.
    They never arrive on time, don’t know which town they’re in,
    and frequently have trouble finding the stage.</p>
<p>Additionally, during the concert, each of the musicians at
    one point takes a break. If three or more of them are on a
    break at the same time, they start stirring trouble in town and
    the rest of the group start panicking and playing the wrong
    chords.</p>
<p>The concert will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    minutes long, during which each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> members will take a break. The
    length of the break is known for each member.</p>
<p>Help the organizer of the concert by writing a program that
    determines how to schedule the breaks of the members so that,
    at any given moment, at most two are absent from the stage. All
    breaks must be <b class="bfseries">entirely</b> during the
    concert.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le T \le 5000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N
    \le 500$</span>), the length of the concert in minutes and the
    number of musicians in the group.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers (each between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> inclusive) separated by single
    spaces, the length of the break in minutes for each member.</p>
<p>Note: The input data will be such that a solution, although
    not necessarily unique, will always exist.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each musician output one integer, the number of minutes
    the musician will spend on stage before going on the break.
    Output the musicians in the same order they were given in the
    input.</p>
