<p>Nora Mainder has a game she plays with her students to help
    them learn multiplication. She calls out a sequence of numbers
    and the students have to determine when she names a whole
    number multiple of the first number. When a student recognizes
    such a multiple, he or she must call out “Mult!”, ending this
    round of the game. Then a new round begins with a new initial
    number. Fortunately her students are very bright and never fail
    to recognize a multiple, so they all cry out at once—a
    “multitude” of shouts.</p>
<p>For instance, if she calls out “<span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>,” her students all yell “Mult!”
    when she reaches <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>
    because it is a multiple of the first number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>. If she begins a second round of
    the game with the sequence “<span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$70$</span>,” the class will call out “Mult!”
    when she reaches <span class="tex2jax_process">$70$</span>, a
    multiple of the first number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>.</p>
<p>Given a sequence of numbers called out by Nora during
    several rounds of the game, identify which numbers ought to
    produce a shout of “Mult!”</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span>, the length of the number sequence.
    The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    contains the sequence, one number per line. All numbers in the
    sequence are positive integers less than or equal to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>. The sequence is
    guaranteed to contain at least one complete round of the game
    (but may end with an incomplete round).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print all of the sequence elements that will cause the class
    to shout “Mult!” Each value should be printed on a separate
    line.</p>
