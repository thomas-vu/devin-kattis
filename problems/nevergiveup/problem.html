<p>Your best friend, after the brutal murder of his entire clan
    by none other than his own brother, decided to leave the
    village to learn from the dark lord to exert his vengeance.
    Unwilling to see him go down this dark path, you decided to
    stop him and bring him back by force if you must.
    Unfortunately, in your final confrontation, you were defeated
    by his rage.</p>
<p>“I will never give up. I will definitely bring you back!”
    you screamed. Lord Pooty, the strongest and wisest of them all,
    was touched by your efforts and decided to train you. Here is
    your first lesson!</p>
<p>The first lesson is on accuracy. You are sent to a cave with
    many ridges and your goal is to throw your kunai such that it
    does not hit any of the ridges. Let us elaborate.</p>
<p>The cave is <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> meters
    long and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> meters tall,
    and is defined by the top wall and the bottom wall. Both walls
    have ridges sticking out, defined in the following way.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>On the bottom wall, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ b$</span> points <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1 = (0,0)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_{n_ b} = (w,0)$</span>. We connect
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_{i+1}$</span> with a
        straight line segment for all <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq n_ b-1$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the top wall, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ t$</span> points <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_ i$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_1 = (0,h)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_{n_ t} = (w,h)$</span>. We connect
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_ i$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_{i+1}$</span> with a
        straight line segment for all <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq n_ t-1$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the ridges on the top and bottom wall form
    polygons defined by the points <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ p_ i\} $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ q_ i\} $</span>. Some polygons may
    intersect with each other.</p>
<p>You will throw the kunai straight horizontally from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, k)$</span> with a starting
    speed <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (meters per
    second). For simplicity, your kunai can be represented by a
    single point, and its trajectory will follow the law of physics
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$g = 10$</span> (meters per
    second squared). In case you forget basic physics, the
    parametric formulas for <span class="tex2jax_process">$x(t)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y(t)$</span> — the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinate of the kunai at time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (seconds) — are as
    follows.</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ x(t) = vt
    \]</span><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ y(t) = k -
    \frac{1}{2} gt^2 \]</span>
<p>Unfortunately, you are not very good at controlling your
    throwing speed. As such, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> will be a <b class="bfseries">random real number uniformly distributed</b> from
    the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[L,R]$</span>. You
    want to compute the probability of your throw being successful;
    i.e., your kunai does not hit or touch the ridges on the top
    and bottom wall.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, denoting the number
    of test cases (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C \leq
    10\, 000$</span>). Each test case has the following input
    format.</p>
<p>The first line contains four integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_
    b$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ t$</span>,
    denoting the width of the cave, the height of the cave, the
    number of points defining the ridges on the bottom wall, and
    the number of points defining the ridges on the top wall,
    respectively (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq w, h \leq
    10^9$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n_ t, n_ b
    \leq \min (w + 1, 100\, 000)$</span>).</p>
<p>The second line describes the bottom wall and contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ b$</span> pairs of two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i, y_ i)$</span>,
    denoting the points <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 = x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; \cdots
    &lt; x_{n_ b} = w$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq y_ i \leq h$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1 =
    (0, 0)$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_{n_ b} = (w,
    0)$</span>). The sum of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_
    b$</span> across all test cases does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>.</p>
<p>The third line describes the top wall and contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ t$</span> pairs of two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i, y_ i)$</span>,
    denoting the points <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 = x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; \cdots
    &lt; x_{n_ t} = w$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq y_ i \leq h$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_1 =
    (0, h)$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_{n_ t} = (w,
    h)$</span>). The sum of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_
    t$</span> across all test cases does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>.</p>
<p>The fourth line contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, denoting the height you made your
    throw and the lower bound and upper bound of the speed you can
    throw your kunai (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq
    h-1$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq L &lt; R
    \leq 10^9$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing a
    non-negative real number, denoting the probability of your
    throw succeeding. Your answer is considered correct if the
    absolute error of each value is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span>. In other words, if the
    correct value is <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    your answer is <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$|x - y| \leq
    10^{-5}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample Input</h2>
<p>For the first test case, if you throw your kunai at speed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v=13$</span>, the following is
    what the trajectory looks like. The throw is successful since
    it does not hit any ridges.<br/></p>

<br/></p>
<p>However, if you throw your kunai at speed <span class="tex2jax_process">$v=16$</span>, the following is what the
    trajectory looks like. The throw is not successful since it
    hits the ridges on the top wall.<br/></p>
