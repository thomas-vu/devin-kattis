<div class="problembody">
<p>A bus with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    passengers opens its door at the bus stop. Exactly half of its
    passengers and an additional half of a passenger get out. On
    the next stop, again, half of the passengers plus half of a
    passenger leave the bus. This goes on for <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> stops in total. Knowing that the
    bus leaves the last stop empty, and that no one was hurt during
    the trip, determine the initial number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> of people in the bus.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the number of test cases
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>. The descriptions of
    the test cases follow:</p>
<p>The only line of each test case contains the number of stops
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq 30$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing a single
    integerâ€”the initial number of bus passengers.</p>
