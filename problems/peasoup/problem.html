</div>As a Swede, you hold a deep love for the traditional
    Thursday lunch of pea soup and pancakes. You love it so much,
    in fact, that you will eat it any meal it is available. You
    find yourself looking at the menus for all your favorite
    restaurants every day to see if this combination is available,
    and realized you can do this more easily with a program. Given
    a list of restaurant menus, decide where to eat.
    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 10$</span>), the number of restaurants. Then follow
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> restaurant menus.
    Each menu starts with a line containing a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le k \le 10$</span>), the number of menu items for the day.
    The remainder of the menu consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k + 1$</span> lines, each containing a
    nonempty string of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters. The first of these
    lines is the restaurant name, and the rest are menu items.
    Strings consist only of lower case letters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>’-‘<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>’ and spaces,
    and they always start and end with a letter. All restaurant
    names are unique.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line. If at least one restaurant has both
    “<tt class="ttfamily">pea soup</tt>” and “<tt class="ttfamily">pancakes</tt>” as menu items, output the name of the
    first of those restaurants, by the order in which the
    restaurants appear in the input. Otherwise, output “<tt class="ttfamily">Anywhere is fine I guess</tt>”.</p>
