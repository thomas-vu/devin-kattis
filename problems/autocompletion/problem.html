</div>You are creating an awesome web application for this
    year’s hackNY hackathon. Everything goes well except that the
    search box in your application (which is a native HTML input
    tag) appears a little clumsy given that the user always has to
    type everything from scratch. To improve the user experience,
    your team has decided to add an auto completion feature to the
    search box. However all other team members are busy. So you are
    asked to program the auto completion algorithm.
    <p>The auto completion algorithm works based on a pre-defined
    dictionary of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> words.
    Suppose the search box contains the text <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>. When the user presses the tab key
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> times in a row, the
    algorithm finds the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    lexicographically smallest word from the dictionary that has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> as its <i class="it">non-trivial</i> prefix. If there are fewer than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> words that have
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> as prefix, the
    algorithm circulates through these words. That is, if there are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j &lt; i$</span> words that have
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> as prefix, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(j+1)$</span>-th tab press goes
    back to the lexicographically smallest word, and the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(j+2)$</span>-th tab press gives
    the second lexicographically smallest word, and so on. The
    chosen word then replaces the text in the search box. If there
    are no words that have <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>
    as prefix, pressing the tab has no effect. When the user types
    a letter, the letter is directly appended to the text.</p>
<p>For example, suppose the dictionary has four words:
    “albert”, “app”, “apple”, and “appletree”. If the user types
    “app” and then presses the tab key twice, she will get
    “appletree”, which is the second lexicographically smallest
    word that has “app” as non-trivial prefix. If she presses the
    tab key three times instead after typing “app”, she will get
    “apple” by the word circulation design. The user may also
    obtain “appletree” by first typing “a”, pressing the tab key
    three times (getting “apple”), typing two letters “tr”, and
    finally pressing the tab key once.</p>
<p>You team has prepared some simulated user keystroke
    sequences for you to test the auto completion.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line has a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 10^5$</span>), the number of words in the
    dictionary. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines gives a dictionary word. All
    dictionary words are unique and contain only lowercase English
    letters. No dictionary word has a length larger than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^5$</span>. The total length
    of all dictionary words does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \cdot 10^5$</span>.</p>
<p>The next line has a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq q \leq 10^5$</span>), the number of keystroke sequences.
    Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines
    has a string that represents a user’s keystroke sequence. A
    keystroke sequence consists of lowercase English letters and
    hash signs. Each hash sign denotes one press on the tab key.
    The total length of all keystroke sequences does not exceed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \times 10^5$</span>. No
    keystroke sequence starts with a hash sign. It is assumed that
    the user does not pause between two consecutive tab presses, so
    that a sequence of consecutive tab presses triggers the auto
    completion only once.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that the total length of the text produced
    by all keystroke sequences does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each keystroke sequence, output the text it produces on
    a single line.</p>
