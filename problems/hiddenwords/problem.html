<p>Ingrid is solving the Saturday newspaper <em>Hidden Words in
    a Grid</em> -puzzle, but is finding it a bit tedious to do by
    hand. Luckily Ingrid knows how to program, and has written a
    neat image recognition routine that converts a picture of the
    puzzle into a nice text-based format. However, she is
    struggling with writing the program that actually solves the
    puzzle â€“ can you help her out?</p>
<p>A word is contained within a <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> grid if the word can be
    constructed by starting in a cell in the grid and walking from
    there to neighboring unvisited cells. A cell neighbors another
    cell if it is adjacent, not including diagonal movement. Given
    such a grid and a list of words, decide how many of the words
    in the list are contained in the grid.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line consists of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq h, w \leq 10$</span>), the height and width of the grid.
    Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> lines follow,
    each containing a string of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> consisting exclusively of
    uppercase letters describing one row of the grid. Then follows
    a line with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 100\, 000$</span>), indicating the number of words
    Ingrid is looking for. Finally the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> words follow, each on a separate
    line. None of these words are longer than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output consists of a single number, the number of words
    underneath the grid that are contained in the grid.</p>
