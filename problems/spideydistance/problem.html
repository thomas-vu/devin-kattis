<p>Consider a 2D plane of points with integer coordinates. The
    <em>Taxi-cab Distance</em> between two points is a measure of
    the shortest path between the points where movement is
    restricted to only horizontal and vertical paths, similar to
    following the lines on traditional graph paper. Each point
    connects to exactly four others, and each is one unit away.</p>
<p>The <em>Spidey Distance</em> is a similar measure of the
    shortest path, but allows movement horizontally, vertically, or
    along diagonal paths. Horizontal and vertical points are
    separated by one unit, but diagonal points are <span class="tex2jax_process">$1.5$</span> units away. Thus, each point
    connects to eight other points, four of which are one unit away
    and four of which are <span class="tex2jax_process">$1.5$</span> units away.</p>
<p>Write a program to compute the fraction of the number of
    points reachable via a given taxi-cab distance from a point,
    within an area defined by a spidey distance around that
    point.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The single line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le t,s \le 10^6$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> is a taxi-cab distance, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is a spidey
    distance.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a fraction in the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>/<span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, which is the fraction of points
    within the given spidey distance that can also be reached
    within the given taxi-cab distance. Output this fraction
    reduced to lowest form. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$d=1$</span> only output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Do not output any spaces around
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$/$</span>.</p>
