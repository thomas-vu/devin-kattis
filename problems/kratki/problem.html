<p>All of you are probably very familiar with the problem of
    finding the longest monotone subsequence. You probably think
    you know all about it. In order to convince us, solve the
    problem “opposite” to finding the longest monotone
    subsequence.</p>
<p>For given <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, find a sequence that
    consists of numbers from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> such that each of the numbers in
    it appears exactly once and the length of its longest monotone
    subsequence (ascending or descending) is exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq K \leq N \leq 10^6$</span>), the length of the sequence
    and the required length of the longest monotone
    subsequence.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the required sequence doesn’t exist, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> in the first and only line.</p>
<p>If the required sequence exists, output the required
    sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> numbers in
    the first and only line. Separate the numbers with a single
    space.</p>
<p>The required sequence (if it exists) is not necessarily
    unique, so you can output any valid sequence.</p>
