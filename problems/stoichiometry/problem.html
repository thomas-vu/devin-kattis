<p>You have landed a lucrative contract with Amalgamated
    Chemical Manufacturing (ACM), to help their chemists with
    stoichiometry. Stoichiometry is the calculation of reactants
    and products in chemical reactions, based on the law of
    conservation of mass, which states that the total mass of the
    reactants equals the total mass of the products. The relations
    among quantities of reactants and products typically form a
    ratio of positive integers. If the amounts of the separate
    reactants are known, then the amount of the product can be
    calculated, and vice-versa. The relationship of reactants to
    products can be described using a soichiometric equation such
    as:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{equation} \rm {C
    H_4 + 2 O_2 \rightarrow C O_2 + 2 H_2 O}, \end{equation}</span>
<p>which can be read as: “One molecule of <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rm C H_4$</span> and two molecules of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rm O_2$</span> yield one
    molecule of <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rm C O_2$</span>
    and two molecules of <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rm H_2
    O$</span>.” The total number of atoms of each element on the
    left hand side of the stoichiometric equation must match the
    number of atoms of that element on right hand side. Your task
    is to write a program that, given an equation of the
    form:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{equation} \rm {\_
    H_2 O + \_ C O_2 \rightarrow \_ O_2 + \_ C_6 H_{12} O_6},
    \label{exampleeq} \end{equation}</span>
<p>will fill in the blanks to produce a balanced equation. For
    example, the above equation could be balanced as
    follows:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{equation} \rm
    {6H_2O + 6CO_2 \rightarrow 6O_2 + 1C_6H_{12}O_6}.
    \end{equation}</span>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>An equation is input in the form of a sequence of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 &lt; M \le 20)$</span> lines, one for
    each molecule in the formula (e.g., <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rm {H_2 O}$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rm {CO_2}$</span>). Each line <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le m \le M$</span>) has the following
    fields:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{equation*}
    sign_ m\; \; N_ m\; \; element_{m,1}\; \; count_{m,1}\; \;
    \ldots \; \; element_{m,{N_ m}}\; \; count_{m,{N_ m}}
    \end{equation*}</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$sign_ m$</span> is
    either <tt>+1</tt> or <tt>-1</tt>, with a sign of <tt>+1</tt>
    indicating that this molecule appears on the left of the
    equation, and <tt>-1</tt> indicating that it appears on the
    right. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_ m$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; N_ m &lt; 20$</span>, is
    the number of <span class="tex2jax_process">$element$</span>/<span class="tex2jax_process">$count$</span> pairs following on the line.
    Each <span class="tex2jax_process">$element_{m,n}$</span>,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le N_ m$</span>,
    is an element name consisting of one or two upper or lowercase
    letters, and each <span class="tex2jax_process">$count_{m,n}$</span> is a positive integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq count_{m,n} \leq
    12$</span>. For example, the element/count pair “<tt>Fe 2</tt>”
    indicates that the molecule contains two atoms of the element
    Fe (iron). There will be no more than 10 unique elements in a
    single equation.</p>
<p>Note that an element may be repeated in a given line of
    input, as in<br/>
<tt>+1 6 C 1 H 5 C 1 O 1 O 1 H 1</tt><br/>
    which specifies that at least one molecule of <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rm CH_5COOH$</span> appears on the left
    side of the equation. Note that <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rm CH_5COOH$</span> can be written as
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rm C_2H_6O_2$</span>.</p>
<p>Input ends with a line of the form<br/>
<tt>0 0</tt></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The program must output the numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_1,\ldots ,C_ M$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0&lt;C_ i\le 1\, 000)$</span>, in order, to
    fill in the blanks in the equation. Each number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ m\mid 1\le m \le M$</span>, must be the
    minimum number for which the equation is balanced (i.e. there
    is no common factor that could reduce all of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ m$</span> coefficients). You may assume
    that every input test case has exactly one valid solution
    meeting these criteria.</p>
