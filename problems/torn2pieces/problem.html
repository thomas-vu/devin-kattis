<p>You have arrived in The Big City but your journey is not yet
    complete. You must still navigate the subway and get to your
    final destination. The information booth in the subway station
    is unattended and fresh out of maps of the subway system. On
    the floor you notice fragments of a map. Can you piece together
    enough of the map to figure out how to get to your final
    destination?</p>
<p>Each fragment of the map happens to perfectly contain a
    single subway station while also identifying all of the other
    stations that it connects to. Each connection between stations
    is bi-directional such that it can be travelled going either
    direction. Using all of the available fragments, your task is
    to determine the sequence of stations you must pass through in
    order to reach your final destination or state that there is no
    route if you don’t have enough information to complete your
    journey.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input has an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 32$</span>, that identifies
    the number of pieces of the map that were found.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    each describe a station depicted on one of those pieces. Each
    of these lines starts with the name of the station they
    describe and is followed by a space-separated list of all of
    the station names that are directly connected to that station
    (there may be as many as <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span>).</p>
<p>The final line identifies a starting station and a
    destination station. The destination station is guaranteed to
    be different than the starting station.</p>
<p>Each station name is a string of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> characters using only letters a–z
    and A–Z. It is guaranteed that there is at most one simple
    route (without revisiting stations) from the starting station
    to the destination station.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Give the sequence of stations that leads from the starting
    station to the destination station. Separate station names with
    spaces. If there are not enough pieces of the map to find a
    route from the starting station to the destination station then
    output “<tt class="ttfamily">no route found</tt>”.</p>
