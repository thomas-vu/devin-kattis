<p>I have a problem. I was supposed to make a budget proposal
    for this competition and I haven’t started yet. It must be done
    at the end of the competition or the others will notice that I
    haven’t done it. This is where I need you.</p>
<p>The budget proposal is a matrix where the rows represent the
    different kinds of expenses and the columns reptresent the
    different sites.</p>
<p>We had a meeting about this some time ago where we discussed
    the sums over different kind of expenses and sums over
    different sites. There was also some talk about special
    constraints: someone mentioned that Stockholm would need at
    least SEK 2000 for food and someone from Lund argued they
    wouldn’t use more than SEK 100 for paperclips. Anyway, I’m sure
    there was more, I’ll go and try to find some notes from that
    meeting if you write a program that can solve the problem when
    we get the data.</p>
<p>And, by the way, no one really reads budget proposals
    anyway, so you’ll just have to make sure that it sums up
    properly and meets all constraints.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> giving the number of test
    cases.</p>
<p>The first line of each test case contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> giving the number of rows and
    columns (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le
    200$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le
    20$</span>). The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> integers, giving the row sums of
    the matrix. The third line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers, giving the column sums
    of the matrix. The fourth line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le k \le 1000$</span> giving the number
    of constraints. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines contain the constraints.</p>
<p>Each constraint consists of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> specifying some entry (or entries)
    in the matrix (the upper left corner is <tt class="ttfamily">1
    1</tt> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> is
    interpreted as all, i.e., <tt class="ttfamily">4 0</tt> means
    all entries on the fourth row and <tt class="ttfamily">0 0</tt>
    means the entire matrix), one element from the set {<tt class="ttfamily">&lt;</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">=</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">&gt;</tt>} and one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>, with the obvious interpretation.
    For instance, the constraint <tt class="ttfamily">1 2 &gt;
    5</tt> means that the entry in the 1st row and 2nd column must
    have an entry strictly greater than 5, and the constraint
    <tt class="ttfamily">4 0 = 3</tt> means that all elements in
    the fourth row should be equal to 3.</p>
<p>There is an empty line before each test case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case output a matrix of non-negative integers
    meeting the above constraints or the string “<tt class="ttfamily">IMPOSSIBLE</tt>” if no legal solution exists. Output
    an empty line between cases.</p>
