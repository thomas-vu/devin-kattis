<div class="problembody">
<p>Freddy’s garden became so large that he needs a map to
    keep evidence of which vegetables are planted in what area. He
    ordered a high-quality map from the International
    Cartographic Publishing Company (ICPC). Since the map has
    a large scale, it does not fit onto a single page and
    it has to be split into several rectangular tiles.</p>
<p>Even with a fixed tile size (determined by a page
    size) and map scale, the number of tiles may still differ by
    adjusting the position of the tile grid. Your task is to find
    the minimal number of tiles necessary to cover the whole region
    of Freddy’s garden.</p>

</div>
<p>Let’s have a look at Figure 1. The figure on the left shows
    14 map tiles covering a region. By adjusting the grid
    position a little bit, we may cover the same region with
    only 10 tiles, without changing their size or orientation.</p>
<p>Note that the tiles must be part of a rectangular grid
    aligned with the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-axis. That is,
    they touch each other only with their whole sides and cannot be
    rotated.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains several test cases. The first line of
    each test case contains four integer numbers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ r$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ c$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ r$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ c$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ c$</span> give the input image resolution
    in pixels (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le A_ x \le
    1000$</span>), while <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_
    r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ c$</span> is
    the size of one tile in pixels (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le T_ x \le 100$</span>). The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ r$</span> lines each contain
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ c$</span> characters, each of
    them being either “<tt class="tt">X</tt>” (the pixel
    corresponds to a part of the garden to be covered by
    a tile) or “<tt class="tt">.</tt>” (the corresponding
    pixel is outside the garden and does not need to be covered).
    The region pixels form one <em>connected</em> region.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print one integer number — the minimal
    number of tiles necessary to cover all pixels represented by
    “<tt class="tt">X</tt>”.</p>
