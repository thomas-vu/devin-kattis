<p>In a perfect world, your family tree would form a complete
    binary tree, with you at the root. You would have two different
    parents who were distinct from yourself. You would have four
    distinct grandparents who were distinct from your parents and
    yourself, and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, the realities of both rural and royal life may
    yield a family tree that has the same cast of characters
    showing up over and over. If we admit the possibility of time
    travel and its associated paradoxes, it might be possible for a
    person to return to the past and become their own ancestor
    (Futurama, season 4, episode 1). Your job is to detect and flag
    individuals exhibiting these types of aberrant sets of
    ancestors.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> family descriptions. Each family
    is described as a set of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> parent-child relations, one line
    per relation, where each is given as <i class="itshape">parent</i> <tt class="ttfamily">begat</tt> <i class="itshape">child</i>. The parent and child names are both
    non-empty sequences of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> letters from the set A - Z (lower
    or uppercase). Family descriptions are separated by a single
    line containing the word <tt class="ttfamily">done</tt>. Input
    ends at end of file.</p>
<p>If the same name shows up more than once in a family, it is
    referring to the same person. Each person in a family has at
    most two parents.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each family, report in lexicographic order (upper-case
    characters sort earlier than lower-case characters) all
    individuals who have either the same person more than once
    among their ancestors (known as hillbillies) or who show up as
    ancestors of themselves (known as paradoxes). Note that being a
    paradox automatically implies you are a hillbilly. Leave a
    blank line between the reports for different families.</p>
