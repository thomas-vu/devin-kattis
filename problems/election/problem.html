</div>After all the fundraising, campaigning and debating, the
    election day has finally arrived. Only two candidates remain on
    the ballot and you work as an aide to one of them.

    <p>Reports from the voting stations are starting to trickle in
    and you hope that you can soon declare a victory.</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> voters
    and everyone votes for one of the two candidates (there are no
    spoiled ballots). In order to win, a candidate needs more than
    half of the votes. A certain number <span class="tex2jax_process">$M \leq N$</span> of ballots have been
    counted, and there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$V_
    i$</span> votes for candidate <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$V_1+V_2 = M$</span>).</p>
<p>Due to the historical data and results of highly scientific
    polls, you know that each of the remaining votes has a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$50\% $</span> chance to go to
    your candidate (the first candidate, corresponding to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$V_1$</span>). That makes you
    think that you could announce the win before all the votes are
    counted. So, if the probability of winning strictly exceeds a
    certain threshold <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>, the
    victory is yours! We just hope you are sure of this, we donâ€™t
    want any scandals...</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 100$</span> indicating
    the number of test cases. Next <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines each contain four integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$V_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$V_2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> as described above.</p>
<p>The input limits are as follows:<br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 50$</span><br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$50 \leq W &lt; 100$</span><br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$V_1,V_2 \geq 0$</span><br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$V_1+V_2 \leq N$</span></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case print a single line containing the
    appropriate action:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If the probability that your candidate will win is
        strictly greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$W\%
        $</span>, print</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">GET A CRATE OF CHAMPAGNE FROM THE
        BASEMENT!</tt></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your candidate has no chance of winning, print</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">RECOUNT!</tt></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, print</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">PATIENCE, EVERYONE!</tt></p>
</li>
</ul>
