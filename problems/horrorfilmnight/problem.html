<p>Emma and Marcos are two friends who love horror films. This
    year, and possibly the years hereafter, they want to watch as
    many films together as possible. Unfortunately, they do not
    exactly have the same taste in films. So, inevitably, every now
    and then either Emma or Marcos has to watch a film she or he
    dislikes. When neither of them likes a film, they will not
    watch it. To make things fair they thought of the following
    rule: They can not watch two films in a row which are disliked
    by the same person. In other words, if one of them does not
    like the current film, then they are reassured they will like
    the next one. They open the TV guide and mark their preferred
    films. They only receive one channel which shows one film per
    day. Luckily, the TV guide has already been determined for the
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> million days.</p>
<p>Can you determine the maximal number of films they can watch
    in a fair way?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two lines, one for each person. Each
    of these lines is of the following form:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq k \leq
        1000000$</span> for the number of films this person
        likes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
        integers indicating all days (numbered by <span class="tex2jax_process">$0, \dots , 999999$</span>) with a film
        this person likes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing a single integer, the
    maximal number of films they can watch together in a fair
    way.</p>
