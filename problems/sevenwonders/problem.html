</div>Seven Wonders is a card drafting game in which players
    build structures to earn points. The player who ends with the
    most points wins. One winning strategy is to focus on building
    scientific structures. There are three types of scientific
    structure cards: Tablet (‘<tt class="ttfamily">T</tt>’),
    Compass (‘<tt class="ttfamily">C</tt>’), and Gear (‘<tt class="ttfamily">G</tt>’). For each type of cards, a player earns a
    number of points that is equal to the squared number of that
    type of cards played. Additionally, for each set of three
    different scientific cards, a player scores <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> points.

    <p>For example, if a player plays <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> Tablet cards, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> Compass cards and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> Gear card, she gets <span class="tex2jax_process">$3^2 + 2^2 + 1^2 + 7 = 21$</span> points.</p>
<p>It might be tedious to calculate how many scientific points
    a player gets by the end of each game. Therefore, you are here
    to help write a program for the calculation to save everyone’s
    time.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input has a single string with no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> characters. The string contains
    only letters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">T</tt>’, ‘<tt class="ttfamily">C</tt>’ or ‘<tt class="ttfamily">G</tt>’, which
    denote the scientific cards a player has played in a Seven
    Wonders game.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of scientific points the player earns.</p>
