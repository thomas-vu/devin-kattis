<div class="problembody">
<p>If you walk through a big city and try to find your way
    around, you might try asking people for directions. However,
    asking <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> people for
    directions might result in <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> different sets of directions. But
    you believe in the law of averages: if you consider everyone’s
    advice, then you will have a good idea of where to go by
    computing the average destination that they all lead to. You
    would also like to know how far off were the worst directions.
    You compute this as the maximum straight-line distance between
    each direction’s destination and the averaged destination.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> test cases. Each test case
    starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n
    \leq 20$</span>, which is the number of people you ask for
    directions. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each has two things: your
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span> location when you
    meet the person (since you are walking around meeting people)
    and that person’s directions from where you are standing. Each
    person’s directions are built from instructions of the
    following form:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>‘start <span class="tex2jax_process">$\alpha $</span>’,
        where <span class="tex2jax_process">$\alpha $</span> is the
        initial direction you are facing in degrees (east is 0
        degrees, north is 90 degrees).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘turn <span class="tex2jax_process">$\alpha $</span>’,
        where <span class="tex2jax_process">$\alpha $</span> is an
        angle in degrees you should turn. A positive <span class="tex2jax_process">$\alpha $</span> indicates to turn to the
        left.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘walk <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>’, where
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is a number of
        units to walk.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The ‘start’ instruction is always the first instruction, and
    only occurs at the beginning. Each person’s directions contain
    at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> instructions.
    All numeric inputs are real numbers in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-1\, 000,1\, 000]$</span> with at most four
    digits past the decimal. Input ends when <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print a line with the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates of the average
    destination, followed by the distance between the worst
    directions and the averaged destination. Answers should be
    accurate within <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.01$</span>
    units.</p>
