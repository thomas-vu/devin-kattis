<p>You have just moved into a new apartment and have a long
    list of items you need to buy. Unfortunately, to buy this many
    items requires going to many different stores. You would like
    to minimize the amount of driving necessary to buy all the
    items you need.</p>
<p>Your city is organized as a set of intersections connected
    by roads. Your house and every store is located at some
    intersection. Your task is to find the shortest route that
    begins at your house, visits all the stores that you need to
    shop at, and returns to your house.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, the number of intersections and
    roads in the city, respectively. Each of these integers is
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>, inclusive.
    The intersections are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span>. Your house is at the
    intersection numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines follow, each
    containing three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>, indicating that the intersections
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$X
    \ne Y$</span>) are connected by a bidirectional road of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le D \le 10^6$</span>). The following
    line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, the number of stores you need to
    visit, which is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, inclusive. The subsequent
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> lines each contain one
    integer indicating the intersection at which each store is
    located. No two stores are located at the same intersection,
    and no store is located at intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. It is possible to reach all of
    the stores from your house.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a line containing a single integer, the length of the
    shortest possible shopping trip from your house, visiting all
    the stores, and returning to your house.</p>
