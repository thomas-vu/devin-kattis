<p>Pokemon Go has become a recent trend. Zapray becomes
    immediately addicted to the game after it comes out. Zaprayâ€™s
    Pokemon journey begins with a bag of <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> Pokeballs. Each time he
    encounters a Pokemon, he keeps throwing Pokeballs to the
    Pokemon until he either catches the Pokemon or runs out of
    Pokeballs. Each Pokeball Zapray throws succeeds in catching the
    Pokemon with a constant probability <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>. If Zapray finds that he has no
    Pokeballs when he tries to catch a Pokemon, he gives up on that
    Pokemon (not catching it) and heads to the Pokeshop to buy a
    new bag of <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> Pokeballs
    for <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> dollars. Zapray
    moves on to search for his next Pokemon after he refills the
    Pokeballs. In particular, if Zapray successfully catches a
    Pokemon with his last Pokeball, he does not refill his
    Pokeballs until he encounters the next Pokemon and realizes
    that he has run out of Pokeballs.</p>
<p>Suppose Zapray encounters <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> Pokemons in the next few days,
    what is the expected amount of money he would spend on
    Pokeballs?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input has an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N\leq 10^9$</span>) and a real number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq P\leq 1$</span>). <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is given with exactly three digits
    after the decimal point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the expected amount of money Zapray would spend on
    Pokeballs. Your answer is considered correct if it has an
    absolute or relative error of no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> from the correct answer.</p>
