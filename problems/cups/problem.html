</div>You are programming a cup stacking module for your robot.
    This robot is equiped with several sensors that can accurately
    determine the radius and color of a cup. The problem is that
    there is a glitch in the robot’s core routine that processess
    sensor inputs so the radius is doubled, if the result of the
    color sensor arrives to the routine after the radius.
    <p>For instance, for a red cup with a radius of <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> units, your module will receive
    either “red 5” or “10 red” message.</p>
<p>Given a list of messages from the core routine, each
    describing a different cup, can you put the cups in order of
    the smallest to the largest?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input file contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of cups
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 20$</span>). Next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines will contain two
    tokens each, either as “color radius” or “diameter color”. The
    radius of a cup <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> will
    be a positive integer less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span>. The color of a cup
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> will be a non-empty
    string of lower case English letters of length at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>. All cups will be
    different in both size and color.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output colors of cups, one color per line, in order of
    increasing radius.</p>
