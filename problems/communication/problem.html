</div>Your best friend Adam has recently bought a Raspberry Pi
    and some equipment, including a wireless temperature sensor and
    a 433MHz receiver to receive the signals the sensors sends.
    Adam plans to use the Raspberry Pi as an in-door display for
    his weather sensor. As he is very good with electronics, he
    quickly managed to get the receiver to receive the signals of
    the sensor. However, when he looked at the bytes sent by the
    sensor he could not make heads or tails of them. After some
    hours looking through a lot of websites, he found a document
    explaining that his weather sensor scrambles the data it sends,
    to prevent it from being used together with products from other
    manufacturers.

    <p>Luckily, the document also describes how the sensor
    scrambles its communication. The document states that the
    sensor applies the expression <tt>x ^ (x &lt;&lt; 1)</tt> to
    every byte sent. The <tt>^</tt> operator is bit-wise
    XOR<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000005"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a>, e.g., <span class="tex2jax_process">$\verb|10110000 ^ 01100100| =
    \verb|11010100|$</span>. The <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt> operator is a
    (non-circular) left shift of a byte value<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000006"><sup class="footnotemark">2</sup></a>, e.g.,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\verb|10111001 &lt;&lt; 1| =
    \verb|01110010|$</span>.</p>
<p>In order for Adam’s Raspberry Pi to correctly interpret the
    bytes sent by the weather sensor, the transmission needs to be
    unscrambled. However, Adam is not good at programming (actually
    he is a pretty bad programmer). So he asked you to help him and
    as a good friend, you are always happy to oblige. Can you help
    Adam by implementing the unscrambling algorithm?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 10^5$</span>), the number of
        bytes in the message sent by the weather sensor;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_1, \ldots , b_
        n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq b_ i \leq
        255$</span> for all <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>), the byte values of the
        message.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> byte values
    (in decimal encoding), the unscrambled message.</p>
