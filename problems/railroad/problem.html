<div class="problembody">
<p>The Slovak national railroad company has recently built new
    tracks. They want to update their railroad map according to
    these changes. But they want the map to be as simple as
    possible. So they decided to remove from the map all the
    stations that have exactly two other direct connections to
    other stations (i.e., a single railroad passing through the
    station).</p>
<p>You will be given the complete map of Slovak railroads. It
    consists of railway stations numbered from 1 to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, and railroad segments between
    some pairs of these stations. For each railroad segment we are
    given its length. Your task is to remove all such stations that
    are directly connected with exactly two other stations, and
    output the new map. The new map must contain correct distances
    between the remaining stations.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input file contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T\leq 10$</span> specifying the
    number of test cases. Each test case is preceded by a blank
    line.</p>
<p>Each test case begins with a line with two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N\leq 10\, 000, 1\leq M\leq 30\,
    000$</span>. The number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> denotes the number of stations and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> is the number of
    railroad segments. <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    lines follow, each with 3 integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a, b$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq a, b\leq N$</span>) specifying that
    there is a railroad segment of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> connecting stations <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>.</p>
<p>You can assume that in each test case there is a path
    between every two stations. Also, there will always be at least
    2 stations that are not directly connected to exactly two other
    stations.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, the output shall consist of multiple
    lines. The first line shall contain a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> â€“ the number of
    railroads on the simplified map. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> lines shall contain three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a, b$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> stating that there is a railroad
    of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> between
    stations <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> on the simplified
    map.</p>
<p>Print a blank line between outputs for different test
    cases.</p>
