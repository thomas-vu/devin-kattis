<div class="problembody">
<p>Preparing a problem set is a very hard task. There are
    always issues with clarity of problem statements, bugs in our
    solutions, input or output data, and so on. Sometimes, despite
    our best efforts, these issues are only found during the
    contest, and this can really spoil it.</p>
<p>To prevent this from happening in the future, we already
    started to prepare data for IPSC 2009, and we decided to use
    your help in doing so. Currently we are working on a simple
    textbook problem: “Given a weighted undirected complete graph,
    find its minimum spanning tree.” (See the Definitions below if
    you are not sure what a spanning tree is.)</p>
<p>Almost everythig is already prepared for this problem: the
    problem statement, our solution, and also the desired output
    data. The only (and quite important) thing left is the input
    data. But creating it is not as simple as it looks.</p>
<p>The bad thing that can happen is that a graph can have more
    than one minimum spanning tree. If we used such a graph in the
    input data, we would have to write a complicated checker. And
    we are too lazy to do this. Therefore we want to find an input
    data that avoids such cases.</p>
<p>Moreover, we want the test data to be good. If all the other
    edges were much more expensive, the minimum spanning tree would
    be obvious, and many incorrect algorithms would be able to find
    it. Therefore we want all the edge weights to be as small as
    possible.</p>
<h2>Definitions</h2>
<p>A graph is a set of nodes, and a set of links. Each link
    connects two nodes. Each pair of nodes is connected by at most
    one link. Each link is assigned a positive integer (its
    weight). The sum of the weights of all links in a graph is the
    weight of that graph.</p>
<p>If every two nodes are connected by a link we say that the
    graph is complete. A sequence of nodes <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_0, \ldots , v_ n$</span> such that for
    each <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> the nodes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_{i+1}$</span> are connected by a link, is
    called a path. If every two nodes in a graph are connected by a
    path, we say that the graph is connected. If there is exactly
    one path between any two nodes we say that graph is a tree. A
    spanning subgraph of a connected graph <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> is a connected graph that contains
    all nodes of <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> and some
    (not necessarily all) of its links. A spanning subgraph
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> of a graph
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> is called the minimum
    spanning tree of <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> if
    and only if no other spanning subgraph has a smaller weight.
    Note that a given graph can have more than one spanning tree.
    Also note that a spanning tree is always a tree.</p>
<h2>Problem specification</h2>
<p>Given a weighted tree <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, you are to find the minimum
    possible weight of a complete graph <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> is the only minimum spanning tree
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input file contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T\leq 20$</span> specifying the
    number of test cases. Each test case is preceded by a blank
    line.</p>
<p>First line of each test case contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N, 1\leq N\leq 15\, 000$</span>
    – number of nodes in the tree. The nodes are numbered from 1 to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, inclusive. The
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> lines
    contain a description of the tree. Each of these lines contains
    three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i, b_ i, w_
    i$</span> meaning that node <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
    i$</span> is connected with node <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> by a link with weight
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_ i$</span>. You can assume
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq a_ i, b_ i\leq N, a_
    i\not= b_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq w_
    i\leq 10\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, the output shall contain one line
    containing one integer – the minimum possible weight of a
    complete graph such that the given tree is its unique minimal
    spanning tree.</p>
