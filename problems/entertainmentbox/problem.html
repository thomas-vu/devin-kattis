<p>Ada, Bertrand and Charles often argue over which TV shows to
    watch, and to avoid some of their fights they have finally
    decided to buy a video tape recorder. This fabulous, new device
    can record <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    different TV shows simultaneously, and whenever a show recorded
    in one the machine’s <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    slots ends, the machine is immediately ready to record another
    show in the same slot.</p>
<p>The three friends wonder how many TV shows they can record
    during one day. They provide you with the TV guide for today’s
    shows, and tell you the number of shows the machine can record
    simultaneously. How many shows can they record, using their
    recording machine? Count only shows that are recorded in their
    entirety.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n,k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq k &lt; n \leq 100\ 000$</span>). Then
    follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
    containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i,y_
    i$</span>, meaning that show <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> starts at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> and finishes by time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span>. This means that
    two shows <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i = x_ j$</span>, can be recorded,
    without conflict, in the same recording slot. You may assume
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x_{i} &lt; y_{i}
    \leq 1\ 000\ 000\ 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should contain exactly one line with a single
    integer: the maximum number of full shows from the TV guide
    that can be recorded with the tape recorder.</p>
