<p>Taking care of cats is not easy. You need to constantly keep
    them happy, and make sure that you treat all your kitties
    equally.</p>
<p>One day, you come back from work, and realize that your
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cats are eagerly
    waiting for candies. You have <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> boxes of candies with <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span> candies in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> box. You want to pick some
    subset of these boxes to open and use completely. Of course you
    want to treat all cats impartially, so you want to ensure that
    the total number of candies you get from these boxes can be
    divided equally amongst your <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cats.</p>
<p>Can you find a non-empty <b class="bfseries">subset</b> of
    these candy boxes that satisfies the above condition? You do
    not have to minimize the size of this subset.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n \leq 10^6$</span>), denoting both
    the number of cats and the number of boxes of candies. The
    second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    space separated integers, where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq c_ i \leq 10^9$</span>) denotes the
    number of candies in box <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. Note that the boxes are numbered
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If no solution exists, print a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>. Otherwise, on the first line of
    the output, print <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq m \leq n$</span>), the
    number of elements in your subset. On the second line of the
    output, print <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> space
    separated integers corresponding to the indices of the box
    numbers in your chosen subset. The box numbers can be printed
    in any order. If there are multiple solutions, you can output
    any.</p>
