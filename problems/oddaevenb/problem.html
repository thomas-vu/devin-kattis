<p>Fredrik prefers to have his life in perfect order. His i’s
    should be dotted, his t’s should be crossed, his a’s should be
    odd and his b’s should be even.</p>
<p>Odd a’s? Even b’s? You see, Fredrik is a great fan of the
    Swedish pop wonder ABBA. As a tribute, he likes writing songs
    containing only the notes a and b. Furthermore, the sequence of
    notes in the song may not have an even-length contiguous
    sequence of a’s, or an odd-length contiguous sequence of b’s.
    If such sequences were good enough for ABBA, they are good
    enough for Fredrik!</p>
<p>Can you compute the number of songs Fredrik could possibly
    write if they are to contain exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> notes?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains the integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100$</span>), the number of
    notes in Fredrik’s song.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of songs Fredrik can write. Since this
    number can be very large, output it modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9 + 7$</span>.</p>
