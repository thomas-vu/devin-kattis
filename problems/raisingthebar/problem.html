<p>Yraglac sells the finest swords in the land, which he
    fine-tunes to exact measurements. He engraves each sword’s
    exact measurements in fractions of a metre so that his
    customers know exactly what they’re getting. For example, his
    builds his most famous dagger to exactly one third of a meter
    in length so he engraves “<span class="tex2jax_process">$1/3\,
    \textrm{m}$</span>” into the side of the blade.</p>
<p>His customers find the fractions a little hard to work with
    though and have requested that Yraglac adds the decimal
    expansion for each fraction. Since some fractions have infinite
    expansions, like how <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/3 =
    0.333\ldots $</span>, Yraglac can draw a bar overtop the part
    of the decimal that will repeat infinitely. For example, he’ll
    engrave <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.\overline{3}$</span>
    next to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/3$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.3\overline{571428}$</span>
    next to <span class="tex2jax_process">$5/14$</span>.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a></p>
<p>Engraving takes time, so Yraglac wants to know exactly how
    many digits he’ll need to write after the decimal point as part
    of the finite sequence, and how many digits to write as part of
    the infinitely repeating sequence underneath a bar. Can you
    help out Yraglac?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n &lt; d \leq 10^6$</span> on a
    single line, the numerator and denominator of a fraction
    corresponding to a sword measurement.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>, the number of digits in the
    finite sequence after the decimal point, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, the number of digits in the
    infinite sequence after the finite sequence, for the decimal
    expansion corresponding to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n/d$</span>.</p>
