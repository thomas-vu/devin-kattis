<p>You are a spy for the Benevolent Agent Protection Center
    (BAPC) and have recently obtained some top secret information.
    As you are very excited about this discovery, you want to
    inform your fellow spies of these newfound documents by sending
    a message to each of them. One option is to privately message
    all spies within your organization, but this takes a lot of
    time. Fortunately, the other spies have networks of their own,
    so they are able to pass on your message to other spies.</p>
<p>However, there are enemy spies in the network, who will pass
    along the message to the enemy organization. It is therefore
    vital that the enemy spies do not receive your message.
    Luckily, you happen to know who these traitors are, so you can
    avoid them.</p>
<p>There are two ways for you to send the information to other
    spies in the network: either by private or by public message.
    If you use a private message, the receiving spy knows that the
    message is confidential and they will not tell any other spy.
    If, on the other hand, you send a spy a public message, the spy
    will notify all other spies he/she can contact about the
    message. Since the message is not deemed confidential for them,
    these spies will in turn contact all spies they can get in
    contact with and so on (regardless of any messages that they
    received before). Since you do not want anyone else to know who
    the enemy spies are, you cannot tell people to contact only
    specific connections.</p>
<p>Because of the huge size of your spy network, you would like
    to minimize the number of people you personally need to tell
    the secret message, while ensuring that no enemy spies receive
    the message. Can you find out how many spies you need to
    message?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of three parts:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains three integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>. The first integer
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le S \le
        50{.}000$</span>) denotes the total number of spies in the
        network (yourself not included), the second integer
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le E \le S$</span>)
        denotes the total number of enemies in the network and the
        third integer specifies the total number of connections
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le C \le 10^5$</span>)
        between spies in the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>
        lines, with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq S_1&lt;S$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq S_2&lt;S$</span> on each line,
        indicating that there is a connection from spy <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_1$</span> to spy <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_2$</span>. These connections are not
        symmetric.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> integers, indicating that
        these spies are enemies.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may assume that you can message every spy in the network
    directly.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line with one integer indicating the minimum
    number of messages you need to send to other spies, counting
    both private and public messages.</p>
