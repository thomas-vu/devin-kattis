<p>A sequence of positive rational numbers is defined as
    follows:</p>
<p>An infinite full binary tree labeled by positive rational
    numbers is defined by:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The label of the root is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/1$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The left child of label <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/(p+q)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right child of label <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$(p+q)/q$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The top of the tree is shown in the following figure:</p>

<p>The sequence is defined by doing a level order (breadth
    first) traversal of the tree (indicated by the light dashed
    line). So that:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ F(1) = 1/1,
    F(2) = 1/2, F(3) = 2/1, F(4) = 1/3, F(5) = 3/2, F(6) = 2/3,
    \ldots \]</span>
<p>Write a program to compute the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n^{\text {th}}$</span> element of the
    sequence, <span class="tex2jax_process">$F(n)$</span>. Does
    this problem sound familiar? Well it should! We had variations
    of this problem at the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2014$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2015$</span> Greater NY ACM ICPC
    Regionals.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 1\, 000$</span>), which is the
    number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be
    processed identically and independently. Each data set consists
    of a single line of input. It contains the data set number,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, and the index,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, of the sequence
    element to compute (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le
    2\, 147\, 483\, 647$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is a single line of output. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single space which
    is then followed by the numerator of the fraction, followed
    immediately by a forward slash (‘<tt class="ttfamily">/</tt>’)
    followed immediately by the denominator of the fraction. Inputs
    will be chosen so neither the numerator nor the denominator
    will overflow an <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span>-bit
    <b class="bfseries">unsigned</b> integer.</p>
