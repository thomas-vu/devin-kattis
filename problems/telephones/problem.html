<p>In the land of Eden, all phone conversations are happy ones.
    People com- plaining on the phone are immediately put in jail.
    To enforce this law, the police taps all phone
    conversations.</p>
<p>The police wants to hire the approriate number of operators
    to listen to all conversations in a given period of time.
    Unfortunately, each of their operators can listen to one
    conversation only before needing a really long break to rest
    from the effort.</p>
<p>As a contractor of the police department, you have been
    asked to provide a program capable of determining the required
    number of operators. If the program does not work correctly,
    you will be put in jail as well, along with all the unhappy
    complainers. Do you really want to end up there?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each test case starts with two integers denoting the number
    of phone calls <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N &lt; 10\, 000$</span>)
    and the number of intervals <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq M &lt; 100$</span>). This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines describing the telephone
    calls, each one consisting of four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{Source}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{Destination}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{Start}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{Duration}$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{Source}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{Destination}$</span> identify the
    pair of telephone numbers establishing the connection
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq \mathit{Source},
    \mathit{Destination} \leq 10\, 000\, 000$</span>). <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{Start}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{Duration}$</span> are the start time
    and duration of the call in seconds (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq \mathit{Duration} \leq 10\,
    000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{Start}
    \geq 0$</span>). You can safely assume that the sum of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{Start}$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{Duration}$</span> fits
    into a 32-bit signed integer.</p>
<p>Afterwards follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    lines containing the time intervals the police are interested
    in, each on described by two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{Start}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{Duration}$</span>, in the same
    format and with the same meaning and constraints as those in
    the telephone calls. The last test case is represented by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N = M = 0$</span> and must not
    be processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    intervals of each test case, print the number of calls that are
    active during at least one second of the interval.</p>
