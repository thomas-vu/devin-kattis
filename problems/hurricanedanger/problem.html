<p>Hurricanes can cause a lot of destruction when they pass
    over land. Given the path that a hurricane takes and the
    locations of a number of cities, find which city is in the most
    danger of damage. That is, the city that is closest to the path
    the hurricane takes. Assume that each hurricane travels in a
    straight line, and that it has been traveling for a long time
    and will continue to do so for a long time.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 500$</span> indicating the
    number of test cases that follow. Each case starts with a line
    containing four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1~
    y_1~ x_2~ y_2$</span> indicating the coordinates of the two
    different locations the hurricane was already spotted. The
    second line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le 100$</span> indicating the
    number of cities for that case. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each contain a unique city
    name (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> characters from aâ€“z) and two
    integers indicating the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates of that city. All
    coordinates are in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0,
    1\, 000]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each set of cities, print the name of the city that is
    in the greatest danger. If more than one city is considered in
    greatest danger, print them all separated by spaces in the
    order they appear in the input.</p>
