<p>In many table-top games it is common to use different dice
    to simulate random events. A “<em>d</em>” or “<em>D</em>” is
    used to indicate a die with a specific number of faces,
    <em>d4</em> indicating a four-sided die, for example. If
    several dice of the same type are to be rolled, this is
    indicated by a leading number specifying the number of dice.
    Hence, <em>2d6</em> means the player should roll two six-sided
    dice and sum the result face values.</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>Write a program to compute the most likely outcomes for the
    sum of two dice rolls. Assume each die has numbered faces
    starting at 1 and that each face has equal roll
    probability.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input consists of a single line with two integer
    numbers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N, M$</span>,
    specifying the number of faces of the two dice.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$4 \leq N,M\leq 20$</span>
    Number of faces.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>A line with the most likely outcome for the sum; in case of
    several outcomes with the same probability, they must be listed
    from lowest to highest value in separate lines.</p>
