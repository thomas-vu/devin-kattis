<div class="problembody">
<p>Pat and Mat are trying to build a brick wall. They have
    three types of bricks—all have the same depth and height but
    they are of three different widths: 1, 2, and 3. As every
    builder knows (and Pat and Mat learned after watching their
    walls fall down quite a few times), a wall is built by layering
    rows of bricks, with the added requirement that for any two
    neighboring bricks there has to be a brick above that covers
    the connection of the two bricks (unless the bricks are in the
    top-most row). Pat and Mat somehow managed to build quite a few
    rows and now they are about to do the last row. But they are
    having troubles figuring out whether it is possible to build
    the last row so that all connections in the row below are
    covered. Of course, all the rows have to be of the same length
    and aligned on the sides. Help!</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The wall is described on two lines. The first of these lines
    contains four numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_3$</span>, separated by spaces, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the number of
    bricks in the (currently) top-most row and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span> describes the number of bricks
    of width <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i = 1, 2, 3$</span> that are
    available for the last row. The second line describes the
    currently top-most row—it contains a sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_1, b_2, \ldots , b_ N$</span> of brick
    lengths for the bricks that form the row, in the order given by
    the sequence. You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> and each of <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_2$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_3$</span> is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$300$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output contains one line with the string “<tt>YES</tt>”
    if it is possible to build the last row for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th brick wall, and “<tt>NO</tt>”
    otherwise.</p>
