<div class="problembody">
<p>You are staring down a street with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> traffic lights. Each traffic light
    has been set to alternate its color between <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> seconds of red and <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> seconds of green based on the two
    duration parameters <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>. These two
    parameters may vary across different traffic lights.</p>
<p>You saw that all the traffic lights had been green, but had
    just all turned red at the same time. You are wondering how
    many seconds it would take before the traffic lights are all
    green again.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 10$</span>), the number of
    traffic lights.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    contain two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le r, g \le 10$</span>), giving the
    number of seconds that a traffic light stays red and green
    respectively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the earliest time that the lights
    are all green again. If this will never happen, output
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
