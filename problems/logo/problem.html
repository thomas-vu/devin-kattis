<p>Logo is a programming language built around a turtle.
    Commands in the language cause the turtle to move. The turtle
    has a pen attached to it. As the turtle moves, it draw lines on
    the page. The turtle can be programmed to draw interesting
    pictures.</p>
<p>We are interested in making the turtle draw a picture, then
    return to the point that it started from. For example, we could
    give the turtle the following program:</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">fd 100 lt 120 fd 100 lt 120 fd
    100</tt></p>
<p>The command <tt class="ttfamily">fd</tt> causes the turtle
    to move forward by the specified number of units. The command
    <tt class="ttfamily">lt</tt> causes the turtle to turn left by
    the specified number of degrees. Thus the above commands cause
    the turtle to draw an equilateral triangle with sides 100 units
    long. Notice that after executing the commands, the turtle ends
    up in the same place as it started. The turtle understands two
    additional commands. The command <tt class="ttfamily">bk</tt>
    causes the turtle to move backward by the specified number of
    units. The command <tt class="ttfamily">rt</tt> causes the
    turtle to turn right by the specified number of degrees.</p>
<p>After executing many commands, the turtle can get lost, far
    away from its starting position. Your task is to determine the
    straight-line distance from the turtleâ€™s position at the end of
    its journey back to the position that it started from.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer specifying the
    number of test cases to follow. Each test case starts with a
    line containing one integer, the number of commands to follow.
    All distances and degrees are integers. The commands follow,
    one on each line. Each test case will contain no more than 1000
    commands.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the distance from the starting
    position to the final position, rounded to the nearest
    integer.</p>
