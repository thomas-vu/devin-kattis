<p>In Delft there are a number of bridges that are still being
    operated by a human, known as the bridge operator. One such
    bridge operator will soon retire, hence there is the need for a
    replacement. The Bridge And Poker Committee has decided to use
    a computer program to automatically open and close the bridge,
    eliminating the need for human interaction.</p>
<p>However, the computer program still needs to be written. The
    requirements for this project are as follows:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>No boat may be forced to wait for more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The amount of time during which the bridge is
        unavailable to road traffic must be as small as possible
        while still satisfying requirement 1.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span> seconds
    to raise or lower the bridge. During this time the bridge is
    not available to either road traffic or water traffic.</p>
<p>Boats arrive at the bridge at predictable times. It takes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> seconds for a boat to
    sail through the bridge, assuming the bridge is already fully
    raised.</p>
<p>If the bridge is not fully raised when a boat arrives, the
    boat must wait. If there are boats waiting when the bridge
    becomes fully raised, these boats pass through the bridge
    one-by-one, which takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> seconds per boat. The bridge must
    remain fully raised as long as there are still boats sailing
    through! As soon as all boats have passed, the bridge may be
    lowered. But it might be more efficient to keep the bridge
    raised for a little while longer if the next boat is soon to
    arrive.</p>
<p>Given the arrival times of all boats, operate the bridge
    such that all boats can pass through without any boat waiting
    longer than <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> minutes.
    What is the total amount of time during which the bridge is
    unavailable to road traffic?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of boats that must
    pass the bridge (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq
    4\, 000$</span>).</p>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines,
    each containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_
    i$</span>, the time at which boat <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> will arrive at the bridge in
    seconds (<span class="tex2jax_process">$60 \leq T_ i \leq
    10^5$</span>).</p>
<p>Boats are sorted by increasing time of arrival, and never
    arrive within <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> seconds
    of each other (<span class="tex2jax_process">$i &lt; j$</span>
    implies <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ i + 20 \leq T_
    j$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Write one line with an integer, the total number of seconds
    during which the bridge must be unavailable for road traffic in
    order for all boats to pass the bridge.</p>
