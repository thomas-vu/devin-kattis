<p>Every day, Charles drives from his home to work and back. He
    uses the highways of the country that run from one city to
    another. Charles has decided that he wants to help the
    environment by buying an electrical car. Electrical cars,
    however, are not very common in his country yet. They can only
    be charged inside a city; there are no charging stations along
    the highways in between the cities. Moreover, all electrical
    cars are identical except for one thing: the size of the
    battery. As batteries are very expensive, Charles would like to
    buy a car with battery that is as small as possible.</p>
<p>However, this greatly increases the time it takes for him to
    get home, much to the distaste of his wife, Charlotte. This has
    spawned an argument, and after much discussion they have
    decided to compromise: Charlotte is fine with Charles taking a
    longer route, as long as it its length is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$X \% $</span> longer than the length of
    shortest route that Charles could have taken to get home from
    work by using a regular car. Charles has agreed with this, and
    he now wants to find a route that minimizes the size of the car
    battery that he needs, i.e. the route that minimizes the
    maximum distance that Charles has to drive on a highway without
    passing through a city.</p>
<p>The amount of time Charles spends to charge his car can be
    neglected.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: The graph of the second and third test
          case. The shortest path has length <span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span>. In the second testcase,
          Charles’s travel distance may not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$16 \cdot 1.15 = 18.4$</span> distance
          units. As a result, he cannot use a battery with which he
          can travel <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>
          distance units, as the red path <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> has length <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>. Therefore, he uses the
          blue path <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, which has length
          <span class="tex2jax_process">$18$</span>, and the
          longest edge has length <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>. In the third test case, he
          is allowed to travel <span class="tex2jax_process">$16
          \cdot 1.30 = 20.8$</span> distance units, so he can
          follow the red path, where the longest edge has length
          <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>.

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 10\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq 100\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq X \leq 10\, 000$</span>:
    the number of cities, the number of highways connecting the
    cities and the aforementioned percentage <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>. City <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is the place where Charles lives
    and city <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is where he
    works.</p>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines
    with on each line three integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C_1 \leq N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C_2 \leq N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 10^9$</span>. This means that
    there is a highway of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> connecting cities <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_2$</span> (Charles can traverse the
    highway in both directions) <em>without</em> passing through
    any other cities. You may assume that there exists a path from
    city <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to city
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output is a single integer: the smallest maximum
    distance that Charles has to travel on a highway without
    passing through a city, such that the route he takes is at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X\% $</span> longer than the
    shortest route.</p>
