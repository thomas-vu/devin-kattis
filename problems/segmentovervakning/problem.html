<p>After successfully conquering all city-states in Kattago,
    the super-feline kingdom of Katen and its leader Kattis seek
    better control over their conquered city-states, particularly
    in the state of Segby. Segby consists of a single long line.
    Recently, rumors of rebellion have surfaced, something that
    will not be tolerated. More specifically, they have identified
    that all suspicious houses lie between <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{min}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{max}$</span>, meaning the suspected
    houses are points <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> on
    the number line that satisfy <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{min} \le x \le x_{max}$</span>.</p>

<div class="description">
        Kattis is watching.
      </div>
</div>
<p>To avoid a cat-astrophe, Kattis has asked the company
    Purrfect Segments Inc. to manufacture different cameras that
    can monitor the entire street between <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{min}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{max}$</span> (Kattis herself has realized
    the importance of surveillance after several attempts to attack
    a well-monitored wall).</p>
<p>Purrfect Segments Inc. installs their cameras at specific
    paw-sitions so that each camera has a unique serial number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, where camera
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> can monitor a segment
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[a_ s,b_ s]$</span> to
    purr-fection. This means that the camera <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> monitors all numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> on the number line such that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ s \le x \le b_ s$</span>.</p>
<p>The only problem is that the cameras are often vandalized
    since they closely resemble speed cameras. When a camera is
    vandalized, it can no longer monitor its segment. To keep track
    of the suspected segment, they will constantly need to install
    new cameras.</p>
<p>Purrfect Segments Inc. now seeks your help for the next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> days. Initially, there
    are no cameras monitoring the street at all. Each morning,
    either a camera will be installed, or one will be vandalized.
    As they want to appear even more efficient than the Lund
    municipality (see <i class="itshape">Illuminated City</i>),
    they never want to activate more than two cameras in a single
    day.</p>
<p>You are given information about which cameras will be
    installed and vandalized over the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> days. Your task is to determine,
    for each day, whether it is possible to monitor the entire
    segment <span class="tex2jax_process">$[x_{min},
    x_{max}]$</span> by activating only one or two cameras. Note
    that at the beginning of each day, no camera is activated.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains the integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{min}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{max}$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x_{min} &lt; x_{max} \leq
    10^9$</span>), representing the segment where the suspected
    houses are located.</p>
<p>The second line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le Q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$</span>), indicating the number of days
    in the test case.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines
    start with either “+” if a camera is to be installed, or “-” if
    a camera has been vandalized:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>“+”: The line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le s \le 10^6$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le a &lt; b \le 10^9$</span>),
        indicating that a camera with serial number <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> has been installed to monitor
        the segment <span class="tex2jax_process">$[a,b]$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“-”: The line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, the serial number of the
        camera <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> that has
        been vandalized. It is guaranteed that the vandalized
        camera was installed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All cameras have unique serial numbers and are not activated
    when installed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines, where
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line is the
    answer for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    day.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If the segment with the suspicious houses can be
        monitored with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
        camera, print <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it is not possible to monitor with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> camera but is possible with
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, print
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, print <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Points</h2>
<p>Your solution will be tested on several test case groups. To
    get the points for a group, it must pass all the test cases in
    the group.</p>

<h2>Explanation of sample 1</h2>
<p>On the first day, camera with serial number “1” was
    installed on the segment <span class="tex2jax_process">$[2,3]$</span>. There is no way to monitor
    the entire segment <span class="tex2jax_process">$[2,6]$</span>
    by activating any cameras, so the answer for the first day is
    “-1”.</p>
<p>On the second day, camera with serial number “2” was
    installed on the segment <span class="tex2jax_process">$[4,6]$</span>. There is still no way to
    monitor the entire segment, since it activating cameras “1” and
    “2” would leave the segment between 3 and 4 unmonitored.
    Therefore, the answer for the second day is “-1”.</p>
<p>On the third day, camera with serial number “2” was
    vandalized. There is still no way to monitor the entire segment
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[2,6]$</span>, so the answer for
    the third day is “-1”.</p>
<p>On the fourth day, camera with serial number “3” was
    installed. By activating cameras “1” and “3” the segment
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[2,7]$</span> is monitored,
    including the suspicious segment <span class="tex2jax_process">$[2,6]$</span>. Since there is no way to
    monitor <span class="tex2jax_process">$[2,6]$</span> by
    activating only 1 camera, the answer for the fourth day is
    “2”.</p>
<h2>Explanation of sample 3</h2>
<p>On the first day, camera with serial number “123” was
    installed on the segment <span class="tex2jax_process">$[10,15]$</span>. There is no way to monitor
    the entire segment <span class="tex2jax_process">$[10,20]$</span> by activating any cameras,
    so the answer for the first day is “-1”.</p>
<p>On the second day, camera with serial number “234” was
    installed. By activating cameras “123” and “234”, the entire
    suspicious segment <span class="tex2jax_process">$[10,20]$</span> is monitored. Therefore, the
    answer for the second day is “2”.</p>
<p>On the third day, camera with serial number “345” was
    installed. By activating only camera “345”, the entire
    suspicious segment <span class="tex2jax_process">$[10,20]$</span> is monitored. Therefore, the
    answer for the third day is “1”.</p>
