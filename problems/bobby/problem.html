<p>Bobby and Betty have a bet. Betty bets Bobby that he cannot
    roll an <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>-sided die
    (having values <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>) and obtain a value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ge R$</span> on at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> out of <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> rolls. Betty has a variety of dice
    with different numbers of sides <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, and all her dice are fair (for a
    given die, each side’s outcome is equally likely). In order to
    observe statistically rare events while still giving Bobby a
    reason to bet, Betty offers to pay Bobby <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> times his bet on each encounter.
    For example, suppose Betty bets Bobby <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> bitcoin that he can’t roll at
    least a <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> on a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>-sided die at least two
    out of three times; if Bobby does, she would give him
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$W=3$</span> times his initial
    bet (i.e. she would give him <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> bitcoins). Should Bobby take the
    bet (is his expected return greater than his original bet)?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 10\, 000$</span>, representing
    the number of cases that follow. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each contain five integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>. Their limits are <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le R \le S \le 20$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le X \le Y \le 10$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le W \le 100$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, output “yes” if Bobby’s expected return is
    greater than his bet, or “no” otherwise. Bobby is somewhat risk
    averse and does not bet if his expected return is equal to his
    bet.</p>
