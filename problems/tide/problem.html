<div class="problembody">
<p>You are kayaking through a system of underground caves and
    suddenly realize that the tide is coming in and you are
    trapped! Luckily, you have a map of the cave system. You are
    stuck until the tide starts going out, so you will be here for
    a while. In the meantime, you want to determine the fastest way
    to the exit once the tide starts going out.</p>
<p>The cave system is an <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> grid. Your map consists of two
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> grids of numbers: one that
    specifies the height of the ceiling in each grid square, and
    one that specifies the height of the floor in each grid square.
    The floor of the cave system is porous, which means that as the
    water level falls, no water will remain above the water
    level.</p>
<p>You are trapped at the north-west corner of the map. The
    current water level is <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>
    centimeters, and once it starts going down, it will drop at a
    constant rate of 10 centimeters per second, down to zero. The
    exit is at the south-east corner of the map. It is now covered
    by water, but it will become passable as soon as the water
    starts going down.</p>
<p>At any time, you can move north, south, east or west to an
    adjacent square with the following constraints:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The water level, the floor height of your current
        square, and the floor height of the adjacent square must
        all be at least 50 centimeters lower than the ceiling
        height of the adjacent square. Note: this means that you
        will never be able to enter a square with less than 50
        centimeters between the floor and the ceiling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The floor height of the adjacent square must be at least
        50 centimeters below the ceiling height of your current
        square as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can never move off the edge of the map.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that you can go up or down as much as you want with
    your kayak. (You’re very athletic from all this kayaking!) For
    example, you can go from a square with floor at height 10
    centimeters to an adjacent square with floor at height 9000
    centimeters (assuming the constraints given above are met).</p>
<p>These constraints are illustrated below:</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics{tide}" src="/problems/tide/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:; height:"/>
</center>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>In the first image, you can’t move to the right because
        the water level is less than 50 centimeters below the
        ceiling height of the adjacent square.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the second image, you can’t move to the right because
        the floor height of your current square is less than 50
        centimeters below the ceiling height of the adjacent
        square.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the third image, you can’t move to the right because
        the floor height of the adjacent square is less than 50
        centimeters below the ceiling height of the adjacent
        square. You’ll never be able to enter that square from any
        direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the fourth image, you can’t move to the right because
        the floor height of the adjacent square is less than 50
        centimeters below the ceiling height of the current
        square.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When moving from one square to another, if there are at
    least 20 centimeters of water remaining on the current square
    when you start moving from it, it takes 1 second to complete
    the move (you can use your kayak). Otherwise, it takes 10
    seconds (you have to drag your kayak). Note that the time
    depends only on the water level in the square you are leaving,
    not in the square you are entering.</p>
<p>It will be a while before the tide starts going out, and so
    you can spend as much time moving as you want before the water
    starts going down. What matters is how much time you will need
    from the moment the water starts going down until the moment
    you reach the exit. Can you calculate this time?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line will contain a single integer, T: the
        number of test cases</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is followed by T test cases, each starting with a
        line containing integers H, N and M, representing the
        initial water level height, in centimeters, and the map
        dimensions. The following 2N lines contain the ceiling and
        floor heights as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The next N lines contain M space-separated integers
            each. The jth integer in the ith row represents Cij,
            the height of the ceiling in centimeters at grid
            location (j, i), where increasing i coordinates go
            South, and increasing j coordinates go East.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next N lines contain M space-separated integers
            representing the heights of the floor, in the same
            format.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>At the starting location, there will always be at least
        50 cm of air between the ceiling and the starting water
        level, and at least 50 cm between the ceiling and the
        floor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The exit location will always have at least 50 cm of air
        between the ceiling and the floor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There will always be a way out (you got in, after
        all!).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing <tt>Case #x:
    t</tt>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is the
    case number (starting from 1), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> is the time, in seconds, starting
    from when the tide begins going out, that it takes you to make
    your way out of the cave system. Answers within an absolute or
    relative error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> of the correct answer will
    be accepted.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>It is possible that you can go through the whole cave system
    before the tide starts dropping. In this case you will be able
    to wait at the exit for the tide to start dropping, so the
    answer in this case should be zero (this is the case in the
    fourth of the sample test cases).</p>
<p>In the first sample test case, there are initially only 33
    centimeters between the water level and the ceiling of the
    eastern square, so after the tide starts going down, you have
    to wait for at 1.7 seconds to enter it. Once it is accessible,
    you can start going in - but the water level in the western
    square is now so low (only 3 centimeters above the floor) that
    you have to drag your kayak for the next 10 seconds to get to
    the exit point.</p>
<p>The initial situation in the second case is better - you
    have a lot of headroom in adjacent squares, so you can move,
    for example, to (1, 1) before the tide starts dropping. Once
    there, you have to wait for the tide to start going down, and
    the water level to go down to 90cm (that takes one second).
    Then you can kayak south and then east and get out (in a total
    of three seconds). Note that you cannot go through the cave at
    (2, 1), even though the ceiling there is high enough, because
    there is too little space between the floor of this cave and
    the ceiling of any caves you could try to enter from ((1, 1)
    and (2, 0)) - only 10 centimeters in each case.</p>
<p>The third case is somewhat similar to the first - you have
    to wait at the starting position until the tide goes down to
    50cm. After that you can kayak for the exit - but after three
    moves (taking three seconds) the water is at 20cm, which is
    only 10cm above the floor, which means the fourth move will be
    dragging instead of kayaking.</p>
<p>In the fourth case you are really lucky! You can immediately
    go the exit, even before the tide starts leaving, and wait
    there.</p>
