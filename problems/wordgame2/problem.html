<div class="problembody">
<p>On the Word Game show, Ashley has selected <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> words and asks Brandon to combine
    them. Two words <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> can be combined if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> has a suffix of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k &gt; 0$</span> that is a
    prefix of <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>. The result
    of combining them is a new word made of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> concatenated with the last
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$|t|-k$</span> letters of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>. If there are multiple
    values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> that are
    valid, any can be chosen.</p>
<p>Brandon must repeatedly take a pair of words from the list
    of words that can be combined, and replace them in the list
    with the combined word, until the list contains only a single
    word, and that word is as short as possible. If multiple final
    words of the same length are possible, Brandon must find the
    lexicographically first one.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le n \le 5)$</span>, the number of words
    to start out with.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    contain a single word in lowercase letters of length at most
    5.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the lexicographically first word of minimum length
    Brandon can come up with. If it is not possible to come up with
    a single word, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
