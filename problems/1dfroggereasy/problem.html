<p><em>Frogger</em> is a classic <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>-D</span> video
    game that challenges the player to move a frog character safely
    across a traffic-filled road and a hazardous river. What is not
    well known is that Frogger actually began as a prototype board
    game based on a <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-D</span> concept at a now-defunct
    toy company.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000005"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> After spending millions of dollars
    following the advice of consultants, company executives
    realized that the resulting game was almost completely
    deterministic, and therefore not much fun to play,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000006"><sup class="footnotemark">2</sup></a> so they sold all Frogger rights to a
    video game company in an attempt to recoup some of the
    development costs. The rest, as they say, is video game
    history.</p>
<p>The original <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-D</span> Frogger design, however,
    makes for good programming competition problems. Here is how
    the game works. The board is a row of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> squares, each of which contains a
    non-zero integer. These squares are indexed <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \ldots , n$</span>, from left to
    right. To start the game, the player rolls an <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-sided</span> die with one of the
    distinct indices on each side, and places a frog token on the
    board square with the resulting index. The player then randomly
    selects a card from a deck of cards with integers written on
    them (one per card); the integer on each card is contained in
    at least one board square. The number on the selected card is
    the <em>magic number</em> (or <em>goal number</em>) for this
    instance of the game.</p>
<p>The player then applies the following rule as many times as
    necessary until the game ends:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If the frog is on a square containing a positive
        integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, the frog
        makes a <span class="mbox" style="width:">length-<span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span></span> hop to the right. (Hop
        distance is measured in board square units.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the frog is on a square containing a negative
        integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, the frog
        makes a <span class="mbox" style="width:">length-<span class="tex2jax_process">$|k|$</span></span> hop to the left (note
        the absolute value).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The game ends as soon as the frog encounters one of the
    following four fates:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>The frog lands on a square containing the magic number.
        This is the only winning outcome for the player. Note that
        if the frog starts on a square containing the magic number,
        the player wins immediately (i.e., after <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> hops).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The frog falls off the left end of the board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The frog falls off the right end of the board.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The frog hops onto a square where the frog has been
        before, and therefore is trapped in a cycle.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$h \geq 0$</span> be the
    number of hops the frog makes before the game ends. Given an
    instance of the game, your task is to determine the frog’s fate
    and the corresponding value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three space-separated
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of board squares
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq n \leq 200)$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is the index of the
    frog’s starting square <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq s
    \leq n)$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    is the magic number. This is followed by a line containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space-separated
    non-zero integers. These are the numbers in the board squares
    in order from left to right. Each board square number is in the
    interval <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-200, 200]$</span>,
    and the magic number is guaranteed to be one of the board
    square numbers.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two lines. The first line contains a word indicating
    the fate of the frog, one of <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{
    $</span>‘<tt class="ttfamily">magic</tt>’, ‘<tt class="ttfamily">left</tt>’, ‘<tt class="ttfamily">right</tt>’,
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">cycle</tt>’<span class="tex2jax_process">$\} $</span>, corresponding to the four fates
    listed above, respectively. The second line contains the
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>, the
    number of hops the frog makes before encountering its fate.</p>
