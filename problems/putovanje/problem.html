<p>Young Mislav loves spending time in nature and, most of all,
    he loves spending time in forests. The fresh air and lovely
    sounds make the forest his favourite location. Mislav has
    decided to spend this afternoon in a forest and, because he’s
    so practical, he’s also decided to stuff himself with food. His
    belly can contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>
    amount of food.</p>
<p>He will have the opportunity to eat various fruits of nature
    (mushrooms, chestnuts, berries, and so on) while walking
    through the forest. All fruits are mutually different given
    their type and he’d like to eat as much different fruits as
    possible, but with the condition that he doesn’t overeat. In
    other words, the total weight of the fruits he’s eaten must not
    be larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>. Also,
    when Mislav decides to start eating, he tries to eat every next
    fruit if it’s possible to eat it and not overeat. In the case
    when he doesn’t have the capacity to eat it, he just moves
    on.</p>
<p>An array of weights of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> fruits represents the weight and
    order of fruits that Mislav came across in the forest.
    Determine the maximum amount of different fruits that Mislav
    can eat.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 1\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq C \leq 1\, 000\, 000$</span>) from the task. The second
    line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq w_ i \leq 1\, 000$</span>) that
    represent the fruits’ weight.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the maximum
    possible amount of different fruits that Mislav can eat.</p>
