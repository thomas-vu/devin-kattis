<div class="problembody">
<p>DontBeFake is an app where people get a notification at a
    random point in time, and they have to take a picture of what
    they are doing right now.</p>
<p>You have <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> friends on
    DontBeFake. Each friend has a set of intervals of seconds
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[L, R]$</span> when they are
    available. If they get a notification at second <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and they are available, they will
    take a picture and you will get to see it. Because the
    DontBeFake app is slow and so is taking a picture, even if they
    are available a second later, they will not have time to take
    the picture. All friends live in the same time zone and will
    get one notification at exactly the same time in the day. All
    times are specified as seconds from midnight.</p>
<p>You want to know what is the maximum number of pictures you
    can view in the day, over all possible seconds that the
    notification can arrive. In addition, you also want to know how
    many different seconds the notification could arrive for the
    maximum number of pictures to be taken.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a line containing the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 50$</span>). The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each describes the set of
    available intervals for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> friends. Each such line starts
    with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq 10$</span>)
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> pairs of
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$L_ i$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$L_ i \leq R_ i$</span>) meaning that the
    friend is available between <span class="tex2jax_process">$L_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$R_ i$</span>
    seconds, inclusive. It is guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$R_ i &lt; L_{i+1}$</span> for all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i &lt; M$</span>, so that
    the intervals do not overlap. It is also guaranteed that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq L_ i, R_ i &lt; 86\,
    400$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output on the first line the maximum number of pictures you
    can view in the day. On the second line, output the total
    number of seconds the notification could arrive for the maximum
    number of pictures to be taken.</p>
