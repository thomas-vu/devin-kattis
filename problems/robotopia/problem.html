<p>In the wonderful land of Robotopia, life is better than
    ever. This is thanks to all the robots, who work hard together.
    Different types of robots come in different forms, that is,
    different numbers of arms and different numbers of legs. By
    day, when they are working, robots are grouped so they can be
    assigned to different tasks. But by night, it is your job to
    count how many robots there are of each type within each group.
    Robots are naughty and energetic; they don’t like to stand
    still and it is difficult to count them. After many exhausting
    attempts, you are finally able to count how many arms and how
    many legs there are in total.</p>
<p>We know each group consists of exactly two different types
    of robots, with at least one of each type in each group. We
    also know the number of arms and legs that each type of robot
    has. Can you find out how many robots of each type there are
    within each group?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$( 1
    \leq n \leq 100)$</span>. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain one test case.
    Each has six integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_1~ a_1~
    l_2~ a_2~ l_ t~ a_ t$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1$</span> are the number of legs and arms
    (respectively) for the first type of robot, <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_2$</span> are those for the second type,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_ t$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ t$</span> are the total
    number of observed legs and arms. All values are in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1, 10\, 000]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case output two positive integers denoting the
    number of each of the two types of robots. Give first the count
    for the first type listed. If the test case has no solution or
    multiple solutions, output “<tt>?</tt>” (a question mark).</p>
