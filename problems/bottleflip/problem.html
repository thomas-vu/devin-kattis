        Three bottles with different amounts of water.
      </div>
</div>It marks the year 2022 where the <em>bottle flip
    challenge</em> finally reached the last people on earth; the
    NWERC Jury. As you may know, the objective of the challenge is
    to flip a bottle of water <span class="tex2jax_process">$360^{\circ }$</span> through the air and
    hope that it lands standing upright. Figure 1 demonstrates
    a successful bottle flip.
    <p>After many failed attempts, we noticed that this task gets
    significantly easier if the bottle is filled with just the
    right amount of water. The simple reason for this is that the
    amount of water affects the centre of mass of our bottle as it
    is about to land.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> A lower centre
    of mass makes it easier for the bottle to stay upright after it
    lands. Unfortunately, the optimal amount of water depends on
    the bottle, and we already wasted enough time on this
    challenge…</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: Sketch of a bottle flip. The bottle is
          filled to roughly <span class="tex2jax_process">$33\%
          $</span> to ease the challenge.

<p>Given that our bottle is a perfect cylinder of height
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> and radius
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, determine the optimal
    amount of water the bottle should contain so that our chances
    of landing a successful bottle flip are maximised. You can
    assume that both the water and the air contained in the bottle
    have uniform density, and that the weight of the bottle itself
    is negligible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ a$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ w$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq h, r, d_ a, d_ w \leq
        1000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ a &lt; d_
        w$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> are the height
        and radius of the bottle, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ w$</span> are the densities of air
        and water, respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the height such that filling the bottle with water up
    to this height results in the lowest possible centre of mass
    while the bottle is standing upright. Your answer should have
    an absolute or relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
