<p>It gets tiring, looking for all ways in which the word
    ‘problem’ can be used (and mis-used) in the news media. And
    yet, that’s been your job for several years: looking through
    news stories for that word. Wouldn’t it be better if you could
    automate the process?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each line of input is one test case. Lines are at most 80
    characters long. There are at most 1000 lines of input. Input
    ends at end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line of input, print <tt class="tt">yes</tt> if the
    line contains ‘problem’, and <tt class="tt">no</tt> otherwise.
    Any capitalization of ‘problem’ counts as an occurrence.</p>

Problematic pair programming
"There's a joke that pairs, like fish and house guests, go
rotten after three days," said Zach Brock, an engineering
manager.  Working out problems with a pairing partner can be
a lot like working out problems with a significant other.
During one recent rough patch, Jamie Kite, a developer, sat
her partner down for a talk. "Hey, it feels like we're
driving in different directions," she recalls saying. "It's
like any relationship," Ms.  Kite said. "If you don't talk
about the problems, it's not going to work." When those
timeouts don't solve the problem, partners can turn to
on-staff coaches who can help with counseling.  "People who
have been pairing a while, they'll start acting like old
married couples," said Marc Phillips, one of the coaches.
People can be as much of a challenge as writing software.
