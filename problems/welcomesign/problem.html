<div class="problembody">
<p>Amanda is opening a new bakery in town. She will put up a
    fancy LED sign to show a grand opening message on the
    storefront window. The sign has <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> rows and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> columns of display units. Each
    unit can display one letter or be blank.</p>
<p>Amanda has written a message consisting of exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> words. She will
    arrange them onto the LED sign such that each row will display
    one word from the message in order. Each word must be as
    centered as possible, which means that if the number of blanks
    on the left side and right side of the word are <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$|l - r|$</span> must be as close to zero as
    possible. On those rows where <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> cannot equal <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, Amanda would like to balance the
    number of blanks on the two sides. More specifically, for the
    first and every other such row (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1^{\texttt{st}}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3^{\texttt{rd}}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5^{\texttt{th}}$</span>, and so forth), she
    would like <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> to be less
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>. For the other
    rows (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{\texttt{nd}}$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4^{\texttt{th}}$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6^{\texttt{th}}$</span>, and so
    forth), she would like <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>
    to be greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>.</p>
<p>What would the sign look like after Amanda sets it up
    according to the above?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq r, c \leq 50$</span>), the number of
    rows and the number of columns of display units.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines each
    contain a word with at least one and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> lowercase letters (<tt class="tt">a</tt>â€“<tt class="tt">z</tt>), giving the words to display
    per row in order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines. Each
    line must contain exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> characters representing the
    displayed characters on one row of the LED sign. Output a dot
    (<tt class="tt">.</tt>) for each blank display unit.</p>
