<div class="problembody">
<p>Many rockets are made up of several stages to increase
    efficiency. When the fuel in one stage burns up, the stage can
    be discarded, reducing the weight of the remaining rocket. The
    first stage needs a strong engine capable of lifting the whole
    rocket, while later stages can have smaller engines.</p>
<p>In this problem, you will determine which stages to put
    together to maximize the upward velocity of the rocket when all
    the fuel has burned.</p>
<p>For each stage, you will be given:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>the mass <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> of the
        stage, in kilograms, when it is empty (without fuel),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the mass <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> of the
        fuel, in kilograms, in the stage,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the thrust <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, in
        newtons, provided by the engine in the stage, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the fuel consumption <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, in kilograms per second, of
        the stage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Assume that the rocket points straight upward for the
    duration of the flight. Two forces act on the rocket: the force
    of the engine, which is <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> newtons upwards, and the force of
    gravity, which is <span class="tex2jax_process">$9.8 M$</span>
    newtons downwards, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> is the total mass of the rocket in
    kilograms, including fuel. The acceleration of the rocket is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> divided by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> metres per second per
    second upwards, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span>
    is the total net force acting on the rocket in newtons, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> is the total mass of
    the rocket in kilograms, including fuel. As soon as a stage
    finishes burning, it is immediately discarded and the next
    stage starts to burn. The final velocity of the rocket is the
    integral of the net acceleration (due to gravity and the
    engine) over time.</p>
<p>Due to safety regulations, the net acceleration of the
    rocket is never allowed to be downwards, until the rocket runs
    out of fuel.</p>
<p>Also due to safety regulations, the total mass of the rocket
    cannot exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>
    kilograms.</p>
<p>The rocket must have at least one stage.</p>
<h2>Input Specification</h2>
<p>Each test case begins with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of rocket
    stages in the current test case. There will be no more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> stages. This
    line is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines, one for each stage. Each of these lines contains the
    four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> that describe a stage, as
    explained above. Each of these integers can be represented by a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span>-bit unsigned binary
    number. The order of the stages as listed must be preserved but
    some stages (including, possibly, the first stage) may be left
    out of the rocket. The stage listed first is at the top of the
    rocket (and will burn last). It is always possible to construct
    at least one rocket satisfying all the requirements of the
    problem statement.</p>
<h2>Output Specification</h2>
<p>Output a line containing a single integer, the maximum
    possible speed in metres per second of the rocket when it has
    finished burning, rounded to the nearest metre per second.</p>
