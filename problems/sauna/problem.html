<p>Kaisa and her friends are going to the sauna!</p>
<p>Now they have to pick the temperature. Each of them has
    their own temperature preferences as an inclusive range of
    acceptable values. Can you help them find the temperatures that
    everyone is happy with?</p>
<p>Since there might be a large number of possible
    temperatures, they have asked you to just tell them how many
    options there are and what the lowest temperature that works
    for everyone is, as then the sauna will need less time to heat
    up.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of people in the group
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le N \le 2 \cdot
    10^5$</span>). The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each contains two integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_i$</span>, indicating that the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th person’s temperature
    preference is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_i$</span>, inclusive. Temperatures are
    given in millidegrees Celsius, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le a_i \le b_i \le 2 \cdot
    10^5$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two integers: first, the number of different
    temperatures (in millidegrees Celsius) that fit all
    preferences; and second, the lowest such value.</p>
<p>If there are no values that fit all preferences, instead
    output “bad news”.</p>
<p><b class="bfseries">Explanation for sample 1</b></p>
<p>There are three possible temperatures that all three people
    will be happy with: 70003, 70004, 70005.</p>
