<p>Some days, the university campus gets very wet. Other days,
    it can get very cold. Although many times, it is pleasant to be
    outside, there are days when we would prefer to stay
    indoors.</p>
<p>Luckily, the campus designers have gradually connected the
    various buildings with tunnels and bridges. Sometimes these
    connections are built when the building is built, but it may
    also be possible to add them afterwards. Unfortunately,
    sometimes it is not possible to travel between two buildings
    without going outside because the system of bridges and tunnels
    is not complete. You would like to write a program to help a
    newcomer determine how many buildings can be reached from a
    newly constructed tunnel.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a non-negative integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the total number of
    bridges or tunnels built. This number is no more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>.</p>
<p>We assume that all of the buildings have been built ahead of
    time, but at the beginning of a test case, no bridges or
    tunnels have been built yet. The rest of the test case consists
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines giving the
    history of the bridges or tunnels, in the order in which they
    are built. Each of these lines contains the names of the two
    buildings being connected, separated by a space. Each building
    name is a sequence of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> uppercase or lowercase letters,
    and building names are case-sensitive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Whenever a bridge or tunnel is built, print a line
    containing one integer, the number of buildings that can be
    reached from that bridge without going outside.</p>
