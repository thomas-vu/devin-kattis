<div class="problembody">
<p>You are trapped in a building consisting of open spaces and
    walls. Some places are on fire and you have to run for the
    exit. Will you make it?</p>
<p>At each second, the fire will spread to all open spaces
    directly connected to the North, South, East or West side of
    it. Fortunately, walls will never catch fire and will keep the
    fire inside the building, so as soon as you are out of the
    building you will be safe. To run to any of the four open
    spaces adjacent to you takes you exactly one second. You cannot
    run through a wall or into an open space that is on fire or is
    just catching fire, but you can run out of an open space at the
    same moment it catches fire.</p>
<p>Given a map of the building, decide how fast you can exit
    the building.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\le w, h \le 1\, 000)$</span>: the
        width and height of the map of the building,
        respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> lines with
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> characters each:
        the map of the building, consisting of</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>‘<tt>.</tt>’: a room,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘<tt>#</tt>’: a wall,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘<tt>@</tt>’: your starting location,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘<tt>*</tt>’: fire.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There will be exactly one ‘<tt>@</tt>’ in the map.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a single integer which is the minimal
        number of seconds that you need to exit the building or the
        string “<tt>IMPOSSIBLE</tt>” when this is not possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
