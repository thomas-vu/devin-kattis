<p>"Perket" is a widely known and delicious meal. For perket to
    be what it is, cooks must carefully choose the ingredients to
    get the fullest taste possible while keeping the meal
    traditional.</p>
<p>You have <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    ingredients at your disposal. For each we know its sourness
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and bitterness
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. When using multiple
    ingredients, the total sourness is the product of sourness
    amounts of all ingredients, while the total bitterness is the
    sum of bitterness amounts of all ingredients.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, perket is supposed to be neither sour nor
    bitter; we want to choose the ingredients so that the absolute
    difference between sourness and bitterness is the smallest.</p>
<p>Also, it is necessary to use at least one ingredient; you
    canâ€™t serve water as the main course.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq N \leq 10)$</span>, the number of ingredients at our
    disposal. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains two integers
    separated by a space, the sourness and bitterness of each
    ingredient.</p>
<p>The input data will be such that, if we make a meal with all
    ingredients, both the sourness and bitterness will be less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the smallest possible difference between sourness and
    bitterness.</p>
