        The plot of Sample Input 1. They gray area is the area
        under the curve formed by the three input points.
      </div>
</div>Have you heard about the mastermind Tai? He found a way
    to calculate the area under a glucose curve, given discrete
    measurement points. He even validated his formula against the
    approximate technique of counting the number of squares below
    the graph, when printed on graph paper.
    <p>Can you, just like Tai, reinvent the wheel and calculate the
    area under a glucose curve? Instead of publishing a paper, you
    need to implement the algorithm. You need this algorithm in
    your new app, that logs your glucose values that comes from a
    continuous glucose monitor. You have also figured out the trick
    of the device. Itâ€™s not actually continuous, it just samples
    the glucose value frequently, automatically.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains several lines of numbers separated by spaces.
    The first line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 10^4$</span>, the number of glucose samples.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    describe each glucose sample.</p>
<p>Each line contains two numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> is the time of the sample, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> is the glucose
    value at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>.</p>
<p>The glucose values <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_
    i$</span> are inside the measurement domain: <span class="tex2jax_process">$2.0 \leq v_ i \leq 23.0$</span> mmol/L.</p>
<p>Each glucose value is given with exactly one decimal
    digit.</p>
<p>Since you are working with a computer program, the time of
    each sample is given as an integer, the number of milliseconds
    since the first of January <span class="tex2jax_process">$1970$</span>.</p>
<p>The samples are always given in increasing order by time,
    meaning <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt;
    \dots &lt; t_ N &lt; 10^{14}$</span> ms.</p>
<p>Note that a second is a thousand milliseconds.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The area under the glucose curve in the unit <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text {mmol/L} \cdot \text {s}$</span></p>
<p>Answers within a relative or absolute error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> will be accepted.</p>
<h2>Sample Explanation</h2>
<p>In Sample Input <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    there are three data points, where the area between the t-axis
    and the curve is formed by two <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trapezoid">Trapezoids</a>. The
    first trapezoid have the area of <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{2+12}{2}\cdot (2\, 000-1\, 000) = 7\,
    000\, \text {mmol/L} \cdot \text {ms}$</span>, making
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$7\, \text {mmol/L} \cdot \text
    {s}$</span>. The second has an area of <span class="tex2jax_process">$17\, \text {mmol/L} \cdot \text {s}$</span>,
    making the total area <span class="tex2jax_process">$24\, \text
    {mmol/L} \cdot \text {s}$</span>.</p>
