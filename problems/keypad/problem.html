<div class="description"></div>
</div>A matrix keypad consists of an <span class="tex2jax_process">$r \times c$</span> grid of buttons.
    Additionally, there is one wire for each row and one wire for
    each column. These wires are exposed through pins so the keypad
    can be connected to a larger circuit.

    <p>When a button at row <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and column <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> is pressed, the wire for row
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and the wire for
    column <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> will carry an
    electrical current. If just a single button is pressed, it can
    be identified by sequentially checking if a current can be
    detected at each row wire and at each column wire.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when multiple buttons are pressed at the same
    time, it may not be possible to uniquely identify which buttons
    are pressed. The only information you can have is this: for
    each wire, whether there is at least one button along that wire
    being pressed.</p>
<p>The software you are using to detect which buttons are
    pressed was poorly implemented. After probing the keypad, it
    stores the information in an <span class="tex2jax_process">$r
    \times c$</span> grid of <tt class="ttfamily">0/1</tt> values.
    The value stored in row <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and column <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> of this grid is <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt> if there is at least one button in row
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and at least one
    (possibly different) button in column <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> that is pressed. Otherwise, the
    value that is stored at this position is <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>.</p>
<p>Your job is to interpret as much information from such a
    grid as possible. Determine which buttons are definitely
    pressed and which buttons are definitely not pressed.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 200$</span> indicating
    the number of test cases. The first line of each test case
    contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq r \leq 10$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq c \leq 10$</span>. This indicates
    that the keypad is an <span class="tex2jax_process">$r \times
    c$</span> grid of buttons.</p>
<p>The remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines
    of a test case describe the grid. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th row contains a string of
    consecutive <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt> characters. These will not be separated by
    spaces.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the following. If there is no
    combination of button presses on the keypad that would produce
    this <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>/<tt class="ttfamily">1</tt>
    grid then simply output a line containing the word <tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt></p>
<p>Otherwise, you should output <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines, each containing a string of
    length <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>. This should
    describe a grid where the character at row <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and column <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> is:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">N</tt> if no button combination
        that produces the input grid has the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>th button on row <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> being pressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">P</tt> if all button combinations
        that produce the input grid have the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>th button on row <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> being pressed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">I</tt> if some, but not all, button
        combinations that produce the input grid have the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>th button on row
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> being pressed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the last line of each test case should be followed
    by the string <tt>----------</tt> (10 dashes).</p>
