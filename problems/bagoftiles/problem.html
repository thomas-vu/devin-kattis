<div class="problembody">
<p>You and your friend are playing a game involving chance, and
    you are interested in the odds of winning the game. The game
    proceeds as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Your friend chooses <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> tiles, each labeled with a
        positive integer. He shows them to you, and puts them in a
        bag. He then chooses an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq n \leq m$</span>, and tells you
        what it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You choose an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (the ‘target’), and tell your
        friend what it is.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your friend reaches into the bag (without looking!) and
        draws out <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> of the
        tiles, all at once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the sum of the drawn tiles equals <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, you win. Otherwise, you
        lose.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Write a program that determines the odds of you winning at
    this game. Assume that, when drawing out <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> tiles, each tile in the bag has
    the same probability of being chosen.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq g \leq 200$</span> indicating the
    number of games that follow. Each game description has three
    lines. The first contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; m \leq 30$</span>, indicating the
    number of tiles in the bag. The second line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> labels of the tiles in
    the bag. Each tile’s label will be an integer in the range 1 to
    10,000. The third line contains the two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq n\leq m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq t &lt; 10\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each game, print the odds that you win that game. Print
    the odds in the form “<tt class="tt">Game <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> – <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> : <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span></tt>”, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> represents the number of possible
    draws that would cause you to win, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> represents the number of possible
    draws that would cause you to lose.</p>
