<p>Emily the entrepreneur has a cool business idea: packaging
    and selling snowflakes. She has devised a machine that captures
    snowflakes as they fall, and serializes them into a stream of
    snowflakes that flow, one by one, into a package. Once the
    package is full, it is closed and shipped to be sold.</p>
<p>The marketing motto for the company is "bags of uniqueness."
    To live up to the motto, every snowflake in a package must be
    different from the others. Unfortunately, this is easier said
    than done, because in reality, many of the snowflakes flowing
    through the machine are identical. Emily would like to know the
    size of the largest possible package of unique snowflakes that
    can be created. The machine can start filling the package at
    any time, but once it starts, all snowflakes flowing from the
    machine must go into the package until the package is completed
    and sealed.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer specifying the
    number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a
    line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of snowflakes
    processed by the machine. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain an integer (in
    the range 0 to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>,
    inclusive) uniquely identifying a snowflake. Two snowflakes are
    identified by the same integer if and only if they are
    identical. The input will contain no more than one million
    total snowflakes.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case output a line containing single integer,
    the maximum number of unique snowflakes that can be in a
    package – the length of the longest contiguous segment of
    unique snowflakes.</p>
