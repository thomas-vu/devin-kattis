<p>Little John is in big trouble. Playing with his
    different-sized (and colored!) rings and glue seemed such a
    good idea... However, the rings now lay on the floor, glued
    together with something that will definitely not come off with
    water. Surprisingly enough, it seems like no rings are actually
    glued to the floor, only to other rings. How about that!</p>
<p>You must help Little John to pick the rings off the floor
    before his mom comes home from work. Since the glue is dry by
    now, it seems like an easy enough task. This is not the case.
    Little John is an irrational kid of numbers, and so he has
    decided to pick up the largest component (most rings) of
    glued-together rings first. It is the number of rings in this
    largest component you are asked to find. Two rings are glued
    together if and only if they overlap at some point but no rings
    will ever overlap in only a single point. All rings are of the
    doughnut kind (with a hole in them). They can however,
    according to Little John, be considered “infinitely thin”.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a number of test cases, at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>. Each problem starts
    with the number of rings, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n &lt; 100$</span>. After that,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> rows follow, each
    containing a ring’s physical attributes. This description
    consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> floating
    point numbers (with at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> decimals), describing the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> coordinate and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinate for its
    center, and its radius. Input ends with a single row with the
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>. Coordinates
    have absolute value at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, and radii are positive and at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output consists of as many answers as there were problems,
    each answer on a separate line and of the form “<tt class="ttfamily">The largest component contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> rings.</tt>” where <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is the number of rings in the
    largest component. The plural form “rings” is changed to
    singular if <span class="tex2jax_process">$X = 1$</span> (see
    last sample case).</p>
