</div>Alice recently started to work for a hardware design
    company and as a part of her job, she needs to identify defects
    in fabricated integrated circuits. An approach for identifying
    these defects boils down to solving a satisfiability instance.
    She needs your help to write a program to do this task.
    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer, not more
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, indicating the
    number of test cases to follow. The first line of each test
    case contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 20$</span> indicates the number
    of variables and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le
    100$</span> indicates the number of clauses. Then, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines follow corresponding to each
    clause. Each clause is a disjunction of literals in the form
    <tt>X</tt><span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> or
    <tt>~X</tt><span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> for some
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i \le n$</span>, where
    <tt>~X</tt><span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> indicates
    the negation of the literal <tt>X</tt><span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. The “or” operator is denoted by a
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">v</tt>’ character and is seperated from
    literals with a single space.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, display <tt class="ttfamily">satisfiable</tt> on a single line if there is a
    satisfiable assignment; otherwise display <tt class="ttfamily">unsatisfiable</tt>.</p>
