<p>Yi has moved to Sweden and now goes to school here. The
    first years of schooling she got in China, and the curricula do
    not match completely in the two countries. Yi likes
    mathematics, but now... The teacher explains the algorithm for
    subtraction on the board, and Yi is bored. Maybe it is possible
    to perform the same calculations on the numbers corresponding
    to the reversed binary representations of the numbers on the
    board? Yi dreams away and starts constructing a program that
    reverses the binary representation, in her mind. As soon as the
    lecture ends, she will go home and write it on her
    computer.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Your task will be to write a program for reversing numbers
    in binary. For instance, the binary representation of 13 is
    1101, and reversing it gives 1011, which corresponds to number
    11.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single line with an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 1\; 000\; 000\;
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with one integer, the number we get by
    reversing the binary representation of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
