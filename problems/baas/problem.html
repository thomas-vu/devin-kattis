<p>BAAS Inc. (Build Airplanes As-a-Service) has grand plans to
    build lots of airplanes. Naturally, the airplane construction
    process consists of multiple steps, each of which may take some
    time. Some steps can take more time to complete than others,
    e.g. attaching a plane wing may take longer than spray-painting
    the BAAS logo on the tail. Furthermore, some steps must to be
    completed before others can commence. For instance the hull
    needs to be assembled before the wings can be attached to it.
    If there is no dependency between two steps, then the steps can
    be completed in parallel.</p>
<p>BAAS is trying very hard to become the market leader in
    airplane construction. Since customers value a speedy delivery,
    BAAS has decided to invest in their R&amp;D department with the
    goal to decrease their delivery time. The chief scientist of
    BAAS is very optimistic and thinks that his department can
    reduce the time it takes to complete one step to <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. However, since the money is
    always tight in the research sector at BAAS, he could only
    promise to eliminate exactly one of the construction steps. As
    the CEO of BAAS, your role implies figuring out which step you
    would like to eliminate to achieve the shortest possible
    construction time. It goes without saying that as the CEO you
    have complete access to the BAAS’s secret construction process
    blueprints.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 400$</span>), the number of steps in the build
    process.</p>
<p>The next line contains the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \dots , a_ N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a_ i \le 10^5$</span>), the number of
    seconds each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    steps takes in the build process.</p>
<p>This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th of these
    lines contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_
    i$</span> followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_
    i$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_1, \dots ,
    A_{C_ i}$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le A_ j
    &lt; i$</span>). The integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_
    j$</span> denote what steps the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th step has a dependency on.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that there is no step that indirectly
    depends on itself. Furthermore, each step has a direct or
    indirect dependency on step <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> (receiving an order), and step
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (delivering the
    airplane) has a direct or indirect dependency on every other
    step.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer – the shortest possible time it
    takes to construct an airplane assuming a single step can be
    reduced to take no time at all.</p>
