<div class="problembody">
<p>Anthony recently started watching YouTube videos with the
    title “<span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> but every time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> happens it speeds up
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z$</span>”. He likes watching
    these videos because it saves time, but he wonders how much
    time he actually saves by watching these videos (instead of the
    originals).</p>
<p>You may assume that the new video <span class="tex2jax_process">$X’$</span> is exactly the same as the
    original video <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, except
    certain segments of the new video play faster. Each time event
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> happens, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X’$</span> speeds up by <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>%. Suppose event <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> happens <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> times in <span class="tex2jax_process">$X’$</span>, and it happens at timestamps
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1, t_2, \ldots , t_ n$</span>
    (in seconds). That means the segment <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0, t_1)$</span> is playing at original
    speed, the segment <span class="tex2jax_process">$[t_1,
    t_2)$</span> is playing at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(100+p)$</span>% speed, the segment
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[t_2, t_3)$</span> is playing at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(100+2p)$</span>% speed, and so
    on. Also, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X’$</span> is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> seconds long.</p>
<p>Can you help Anthony compute the original length of the
    video?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n, p, k$</span>. It is
    guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 5\,
    000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq p\leq
    100$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n\leq k\leq
    20\, 000$</span>.</p>
<p>The next line of the input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>, denoting the timestamp of the
    event <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>. It is
    guaranteed that the timestamps are given in chronological
    order, and that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq t_ i\leq
    k$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single number <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    denoting the length of the original video in seconds. Your
    answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error
    is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
