<div class="problembody">
<p>There is a promotional offer in a bookstore “Take 3, pay for
    the 2 more expensive ones”. So, each customer who picks
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> books gets the
    cheapest one for free. Of course, the customer can take even
    more books and, depending on the way the books are arranged
    into groups of three, get the cheapest one in each group for
    free.</p>
<p>For example, let the prices of the books taken by the
    customer be: <span class="tex2jax_process">$2, 3, 4, 4, 6, 9,
    10$</span>. If he arranges them into the groups <span class="tex2jax_process">$(10, 3, 2)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(4, 6, 4)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(9)$</span>, he will get the book priced
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> from the first group
    for free and the book priced <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> from the second group. We can see
    that he will not get anything for free from the third group
    because it contains only one book.</p>
<p>The lady working in the bookstore is well-intentioned and
    she always wants to lower the price for each customer as much
    as possible. For given book prices, help the lady arrange the
    books into groups in the best way possible, so that the total
    price the customer has to pay is minimal.</p>
<p>Please note: The lady doesn’t have to arrange the books into
    groups so that each group contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> books, but the number of books in
    a group needs to be between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, inclusively.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 100\ 000$</span>), the number of books the customer
    bought. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C_ i \leq 100\ 000$</span>), the
    price of each book.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the required
    minimal price.</p>
