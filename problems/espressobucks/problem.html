</div>The big café chain Espresso Bucks is expanding to the
    country of Gridland. Since you are an expert on Gridland
    culture and geography, Espresso Bucks have hired you to decide
    where to put their coffee shops for maximum profit. Gridland
    consists of an <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> grid, where some cells
    are land, and some are water. At most one coffee shop can be
    built on each land cell. Nothing can be built on the water
    cells, but on the other hand, no one lives in the water. After
    a lot of long meetings with the Espresso Bucks people, you have
    come to the conclusion that there are only two constraints the
    placement of coffee shops has to satisfy:
    <ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Each land cell must have a coffee shop directly on it,
        or adjacent to it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No two coffee shops can be adjacent to each other.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Two cells are adjacent if one is immediately to the west,
    north, east, or south of the other. Find any placement of
    coffee shops that satisfies these constraints.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n,m \leq 100$</span>). The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain a string of
    length <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> consisting only
    of the characters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’ (land) and
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">#</tt>’ (water). This is the map of
    gridland. It is guaranteed that the map contains at least one
    land cell.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a copy of the map of gridland, where some of the land
    cells have been replaced with the letter ‘<tt class="ttfamily">E</tt>’, meaning that a coffee shop was placed on
    the corresponding land cell. This placement should satisfy the
    constraints above. If there are many solutions, any one will be
    accepted.</p>
