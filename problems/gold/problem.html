<p>We’re building an old-school back-to-basics computer game.
    It’s a very simple text based adventure game where you walk
    around and try to find treasure, avoiding falling into traps.
    The game is played on a rectangular grid and the player gets
    very limited information about her surroundings.</p>
<p>The game will consist of the player moving around on the
    grid for as long as she likes (or until she falls into a trap).
    The player can move up, down, left and right (but not
    diagonally). She will pick up gold if she walks into the same
    square as the gold is. If the player stands next to (i.e.,
    immediately up, down, left, or right of) one or more traps, she
    will “sense a draft” but will not know from what direction the
    draft comes, or how many traps she’s near. If she tries to walk
    into a square containing a wall, she will notice that there is
    a wall in that direction and remain in the position where she
    was.</p>
<p>For scoring purposes, we want to show the player how much
    gold she could have gotten safely. That is, how much gold can a
    player get playing with an optimal strategy and always being
    sure that the square she walked into was safe. The player does
    not have access to the map and the maps are randomly generated
    for each game so she has no previous knowledge of the game.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>, neither of them smaller than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> or larger than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>, giving the width and
    the height of the map, respectively. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> lines contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> characters each, giving the map.
    The symbols that may occur in a map are as follows:</p>
<table cellspacing="0" class="tabular">
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">P</tt></p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>the player’s starting position</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">G</tt></p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>a piece of gold</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">T</tt></p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>a trap</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">#</tt></p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>a wall</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><tt class="ttfamily">.</tt></p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>normal floor</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>There will be exactly one ’<tt class="ttfamily">P</tt>’ in
    the map, and the border of the map will always contain
    walls.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of pieces of gold the player can get
    without risking falling into a trap.</p>
