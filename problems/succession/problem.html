<div class="problembody">
<p>The king in Utopia has died without an heir. Now several
    nobles in the country claim the throne. The country law states
    that if the ruler has no heir, the person who is most related
    to the founder of the country should rule.</p>
<p>To determine who is most related we measure the amount of
    blood in the veins of a claimant that comes from the founder. A
    person gets half the blood from the father and the other half
    from the mother. A child to the founder would have <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/2$</span> royal blood, that child’s child
    with another parent who is not of royal lineage would have
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/4$</span> royal blood, and so
    on. The person with the most blood from the founder is the one
    most related.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 50$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le M \le 50$</span>). The second line contains the name of the
    founder of Utopia.</p>
<p>Then follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    describing a family relation. Each such line contains three
    names, separated with a single space. The first name is a child
    and the remaining two names are the parents of the child.</p>
<p>Then follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines
    containing the names of those who claim the throne.</p>
<p>All names in the input will be between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> characters long and only contain
    the lowercase English letters ‘a’–‘z’. The founder will not
    appear among the claimants, nor be described as a child to
    someone else.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single line containing the name of the claimant with most
    blood from the founder. The input will be constructed so that
    the answer is unique.</p>
<p><i class="itshape">The family relations may not be realistic
    when considering sex, age etc. However, every child will have
    two unique parents and no one will be a descendent from
    themselves. No one will be listed as a child twice.</i></p>
