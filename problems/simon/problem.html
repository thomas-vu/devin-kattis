<p>Simon says is a game where one player is Simon, and the rest
    have to do what he says, but only if he starts his command with
    the words “simon says”. If you fail to perform the command, you
    lose. If you perform the command when he didn’t start with
    those magic words, you also lose. You’ve been playing for a
    while, and it’s getting a bit tedious, because it’s so easy.
    Write a program that helps you decide what to do based on the
    command from Simon.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of a single integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the number of test
    cases.<br/>
    Each test case consists of a single line of text – Simon’s
    command.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq
        20$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each line consists of only the letters <tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>-<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt> and
        spaces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each word will be separated by exactly one space</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lines will not have leading or trailing spaces</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each line will have between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span> characters</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, repeat the command if the first two
    words were “simon says”. Do not repeat the initial “simon
    says”. Otherwise output a blank line.</p>
