<p>Will the galaxy see peace at last? All the warlords have
    gathered to divide all of space between themselves. The
    negotiations have come quite far and the warlords have finally
    agreed on a peaceful way of deciding who gets what. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>-dimensional galactic
    map must first be divided into sectors by splitting it along a
    set of infinite lines. The warlord with the largest battle
    fleet will choose one sector, then the warlord with the second
    largest fleet will choose some other sector and so on, until
    everyone has gotten a sector. This is then repeated until there
    are no sectors left.</p>
<p>Different sets of lines have been suggested, and it is up to
    you to present these alternatives to the meeting. To make sure
    that there will be peace, you are ready to modify the
    suggestions slightly. You have some experience with warlords
    and know that no warlord will settle for less space than anyone
    else, so for there to be peace, all of them must get the exact
    same area on the map. Since space is infinite, so is the map.
    Some sectors therefore have infinite area, so that is the
    amount of space everyone wants. How many extra lines do you
    have to add to make sure each warlord can get at least one
    sector with infinite area?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq W,N \leq 100$</span>) denoting the number of warlords and
    the number of lines in the suggested division of space. This is
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each
    containing four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_2$</span>, each with an absolute value no
    higher than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>.
    This means that one line is intersecting the two points
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1,y_1)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2,y_2)$</span> on the
    galactic map. These two points are not be the same.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of lines you have to add to this
    suggestion to satisfy all warlords.</p>
