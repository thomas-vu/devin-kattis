<p>A Split Decisions puzzle is a type of crossword in which
    each across and down answer is a pair of words instead of a
    single word (as in standard crossword puzzles). Each pair of
    words are identical except in exactly two adjacent positions
    for which letters have been provided in the puzzle – these sets
    of letters serve as the clue for the pair of words. In the left
    half of Figure 1, the letter pairs “IN” and “CR” are given, and
    the words “SINEW” and “SCREW” can be used to solve that clue.
    The right half of the figure shows a typical Split Decisions
    puzzle.</p>

<p>While we could ask you to solve a given Split Decisions
    puzzle, we’ve decided on a slightly different task for you.
    Given a list of words, we want you to find pairs of words which
    could be used in a Split Decisions puzzle. Specifically, each
    pair must differ in <b class="bfseries">exactly</b> two
    consecutive letters AND be the only possible pair of words that
    work for those sets of letters (i.e., no other pair of words in
    the list of words solve that clue).</p>
<p>For example, if your list of words contained the words CELL,
    GULL, GUSH, HALL, and HASH, you could make two clues:
    <tt>[CE/GU]_ _</tt> (for the answer pair CELL/GULL) and
    <tt>[CE/HA]_ _</tt> (for the answer pair CELL/HALL). Note that
    the clue <tt>[GU/HA]_ _</tt> has two possible solutions
    (GULL/HALL and GUSH/HASH) so it should not be considered.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 1\, 500$</span>) indicating the number of words in
    the word list. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each containing one word.
    Each word consists of uppercase letters and no word has less
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> or more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> letters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The number of unique pairs of words in the input for which a
    valid Split Decisions clue exists.</p>
