        Some of Thore’s pink buttons. Photographer: Thore Husfeldt.
      </div>
</div>Thore is a fashionable man. Every time he meets up with
    his programming team, he wears his hot pink team hoodie over a
    salmon colored shirt with shirt buttons in a dashing rose or
    pink shade. Of course, he can’t show up to two training
    sessions with the same buttons on his shirt, that would cause
    unbearable ridicule. If he can’t find buttons for this perfect
    color combination, he will come up with some poor excuse for
    not showing up. He has a box full of different colored buttons
    in labeled packages. Unfortunately, Thore is color blind, so
    his helpful daughter has labeled each package with the color of
    the buttons. Her writing is terrible though, she mixes
    uppercase and lowercase arbitrarily and has no spacing between
    words, so Thore needs your help to decipher the names on the
    labels and select buttons with either “<tt class="ttfamily">pink</tt>” or “<tt class="ttfamily">rose</tt>”
    somewhere in the name, ignoring case.
    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 1\, 000$</span>, the number of
    button packages in the box. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each has a color name, one
    for each package. The names consist of up to 30 characters of
    letters A - Z, a - z.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print one integer, the number of training sessions Thore can
    attend. If he can’t attend any session because there are no
    pink buttons, output his standard excuse “<tt class="ttfamily">I must watch Star Wars with my daughter</tt>”.</p>
