<p>The Association for Curtailing Parentheses in Computations
    is having some trouble. Some members learned in class that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a^{b^ c} = a^{(b^ c)}$</span>,
    but others insist that <span class="tex2jax_process">${a^ b}^ c
    = {(a^ b)}^ c$</span>. You are trying to keep the peace by
    assuring them that it works either way, but you just noticed
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">${(2^3)}^2 = 64 \neq 512 =
    2^{(3^2)}$</span>. Can you write a program to help the
    association members focus on what they can all agree on?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of three space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a, b, c \leq 2 \cdot
    10^6$</span> on a single line.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$a^{(b^ c)} = {(a^ b)}^
    c$</span>, output “<tt class="ttfamily">What an excellent
    example!</tt>” and if <span class="tex2jax_process">$a^{(b^ c)}
    \neq {(a^ b)}^ c$</span> output “<tt class="ttfamily">Oh look,
    a squirrel!</tt>”</p>
