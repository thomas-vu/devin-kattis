<div class="description"></div>
</div>You have a 2D rectangular grid. Each grid cell contains
      either an apple, an obstacle, or is empty. Empty cells are
      denoted as ’<tt class="tt">.</tt>’, apples as ’<tt class="tt">a</tt>’, and obstacles as ’<tt class="tt">#</tt>’. You
      are to implement a simulation of gravity, based on the
      following rules:

      <ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The obstacles do not move.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whenever there is an empty cell immediately below an
          apple, the apple moves into the empty cell.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Print out the final configuration of the board after all
      apples reach their final locations. Merely iterating the
      gravity rule, a step at a time, will likely take too long on
      large datasets.</p>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with a line containing integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, designating the number of rows
    and columns of the grid, such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq R \leq 50\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C \leq 10$</span>. The
    first line is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> additional lines, each designating
    a row of the grid, from top to bottom. Each line has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> characters, each of
    which is either ’<tt class="tt">.</tt>’, ’<tt class="tt">a</tt>’, or ’<tt class="tt">#</tt>’.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> grid lines
    displaying the final state.</p>
