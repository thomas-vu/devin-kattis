<p>The doorman Bruno at the popular night club Heaven is having
    a hard time fulfilling his duties. He was told by the owner
    that when the club is full, the number of women and men let
    into the club should be roughly the same. When the night club
    opens, people wanting to enter the club are already lined up in
    a queue, and Bruno can only let them in one-by-one. He lets
    them in more-or-less in the order they are lined up. He can
    however decide to let the second person in the queue cut the
    line and slip into the club before the person in front. This
    will no doubt upset the person first in line, especially when
    this happens multiple times, but Bruno is quite a big guy and
    is capable of handling troublemakers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately though, he is not that strong on mental
    calculations under these circumstances. He finds keeping track
    of the difference of the number of women and number of men let
    into the club a challenging task. As soon as the absolute
    difference gets too big, he loses track of his counting and
    must declare to the party people remaining in the queue that
    the club is full.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X&lt;100$</span> describing the
    largest absolute difference between the number of women and
    number of men let into the club that Bruno can handle.</p>
<p>The second line contains a string consisting solely of the
    characters ’W’ and ’M’ of length at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, describing the genders of the
    people in the queue, in order of their arrrival. The leftmost
    character of the string is the gender of the person first in
    line.</p>
<p>You may assume that the club is large enough to hold all the
    people in the queue.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The maximum number of people Bruno can let into the club
    without losing track of his counting.</p>
