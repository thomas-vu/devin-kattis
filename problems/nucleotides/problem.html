<p>Genes ’R Us specializes in analyzing strands of DNA to look
    for anomalies, matches, patterns, or whatever specific items
    their customers are interested in. You may recall from high
    school biology that the DNA molecule consists of two chains
    wrapped around each other to form the well-known double helix.
    The chains are made up of four different types of nucleotides,
    each distinguished by a specific nitrogen base: adenine
    (<tt class="tt">A</tt>), thymine (<tt class="tt">T</tt>),
    guanine (<tt class="tt">G</tt>) and cytosine (<tt class="tt">C</tt>).</p>
<p>A recent customer of Genes ’R Us wants to be able to quickly
    determine which of the four types of nucleotides is most
    prevalent in a given section of DNA, as well as which are
    second, third and fourth most prevalent. For a given strand of
    DNA (which may contain tens of thousands of nucleotides) there
    may be many such sections where this information is desired.
    You’ve been asked to write an efficient program to answer such
    questions.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a string describing a DNA strand. This
    string consists of the characters <tt class="tt">A</tt>,
    <tt class="tt">T</tt>, <tt class="tt">G</tt> and <tt class="tt">C</tt> and have positive length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \leq 50\, 000$</span>. The next line
    contains a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$m
    \leq 25\, 000$</span>) indicating the number of sections of the
    DNA strand to investigate. Following this are <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each containing a pair of
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$e_ i$</span>, each indicating
    the start and ending positions of a section of the strand,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s_ i \leq e_ i \leq
    n$</span>. Integer pairs are separated by a single space.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each section output a line containing a permutation of
    <tt class="tt">ATGC</tt>, where the first character indicates
    the most prevalent nucleotide in the section, the second
    character indicates the second most prevalent, and so on. Break
    any ties using the ordering <tt class="tt">ATGC</tt> (i.e.,
    print an <tt class="tt">A</tt> before an equally occurring
    <tt class="tt">T</tt>, <tt class="tt">G</tt> or <tt class="tt">C</tt>, print a <tt class="tt">T</tt> before an equally
    occurring <tt class="tt">G</tt> or <tt class="tt">C</tt>, and
    so on).</p>
