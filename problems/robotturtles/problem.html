<p>Robot Turtles is one of Theta’s favorite games. In this
    game, kindergarteners learn how to “code” by creating programs
    that move a turtle from a starting field to a diamond. Robot
    Turtles is reportedly the most successful game funded by the
    Kickstarter incubator.</p>
<p>Players must develop a program consisting of “instructions”
    that brings a turtle from a starting location to a goal (a
    diamond). An adult will then “execute” this program by moving
    the turtle based on the given instructions.</p>
<p>Robot Turtles is played on an <span class="tex2jax_process">$8 \times 8$</span> board. There is one
    turtle (marked with the letter <tt class="ttfamily">T</tt>),
    which always starts out at the bottom-left field, facing right.
    The board contains empty squares (marked as <tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>), castles made out of rock (<tt class="ttfamily">C</tt>), and castles made out of ice (<tt class="ttfamily">I</tt>). The diamond is marked with a <tt class="ttfamily">D</tt>. The turtle may move only onto empty squares
    and the square on which the diamond is located.</p>
<p>A turtle program contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> kinds of instructions, marked by a
    single letter.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">F</tt> The turtle moves one field
        forward in the direction it is facing. If the turtle faces
        a castle or the border of the board, a program error
        occurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">R</tt> The turtle turns
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span> degrees to the
        right (the turtle will just turn and stay on the same
        field).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">L</tt> The turtle turns
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span> degrees to the
        left (the turtle will just turn and stay on the same
        field).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">X</tt> The turtle fires a laser in
        the direction it is facing. If the square it is facing
        contains an ice castle, the ice castle will melt and the
        square will turn into an empty square. Otherwise, a program
        error occurs. The turtle will not move or change direction.
        It is a program error to fire the laser at empty squares,
        rock castles or outside the board.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> lines, which represents the board,
    with each line representing one row. The turtle will always
    start out at the bottom-left. There will be exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> diamond. There will be
    no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> ice
    castles.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the shortest valid turtle program whose execution
    (without program error) brings the turtle from the starting
    location to the diamond! If there are multiple such programs of
    equal length, you may output any of them!</p>
<p>Output <tt class="ttfamily">no solution</tt> if it is not
    possible for the turtle to reach the diamond!</p>
