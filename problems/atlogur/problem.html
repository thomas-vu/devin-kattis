<p>Guðmundur is a Ph.D. student at an Icelandic university,
    where he studies history. He has a burning interest in duels
    and the ways of knights of past times. In the middle ages, and
    the ages before them, battles between knights were common. His
    research revolves around these knights and, in particular, he
    is interested in writing about the most victorious knight.</p>
<p>Guðmundur has found a manuscript describing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> knights. In the manuscript, the
    knights had been ordered by their tendency towards violence.
    The first knight would therefore challenge the second knight to
    a battle. The winner of the battle would then challenge the
    third knight, and so forth. At all moments, there was only one
    active battle and only two knights participated in each
    battle.</p>
<p>The knight that made the challenge struck first. When knight
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> struck another knight
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, he reduced the health
    of the other knight, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_
    j$</span>, by the value of his strength <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span>. If the health of the other
    knight, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_ j$</span>, was no
    longer a positive number, then knight <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> had lost and knight <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> stood victorious. Otherwise, the
    battle continued and the other knight struck next. The battle
    continued until one of the knights was victorious, and that
    knight would continue on to the next battle. All the damage
    that was done to the knights was permanent, they did not
    recover between battles.</p>
<p>There can be only one that stands victorious after all the
    battles. Which knight will win?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains one integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of
    knights, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1\,
    000$</span>. Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines follow, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th of
    which consists of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_ i$</span>, the health of knight
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span>, the strength of knight
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq h_ i, s_ i, \leq 10\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one integer, the index of the knight that stands
    victorious after all the battles.</p>
