<p>Bob has the task to plan a racing track of a specific
    length. He thought it is a great idea to just form a convex
    polygon that has exactly the required length. Then he was told
    that racing cars cannot drive such sharp corners like in his
    plan.</p>
<p>He has to ensure some minimal radius for all curves in his
    track. Bobs loves the shape of his track, so he don’t want to
    change it too much. His plan is to scale the track down around
    the balance point of the polygon that specifies his track.
    Then, he wants to draw the new track with a line that has a
    constant distance to the scaled track. The chosen distance
    should be minimal distance that fulfils the given minimum
    radius constraint. He asks you to write a program to calculate
    the scale factor for a given track and minimum radius so that
    the resulting track has the same length as the one of his
    original plan.</p>
<p>Bob made some drawings of the first test case:</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with the number of test cases <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; t \leq 100$</span>). Every test case starts with a line
    consisting of two integers: the minimal required radius
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and the number of
    points <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> of the original
    track polygon (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq r \leq 1\,
    000$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le n \le 10\,
    000$</span>). Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines follow, where each line specifies 2D-coordinates as two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\, 000 \le x_ i, y_ i \le 10\,
    000$</span>). <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span> is
    the lower left corner. These are the coordinates of the
    original track in counterclockwise direction. You may safely
    assume that the area of the given polygon is non-empty.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case print out one line. If it is possible to
    construct a course according to the above description, output
    the scaling factor, “<tt class="tt">Not possible</tt>”
    otherwise. The factor must have a relative or absolute error
    smaller than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span>.</p>
