<p>In the game of chess, the queen is a powerful piece. It can
    attack by moving any number of spaces in its current row, in
    its column or diagonally.</p>
<p>In the eight queens puzzle, eight queens must be placed on a
    standard <span class="tex2jax_process">$8 \times 8$</span>
    chess board so that no queen can attack another. The center
    figure below shows an invalid solution; two queens can attack
    each other diagonally. The figure on the right shows a valid
    solution. Given a description of a chess board, your job is to
    determine whether or not it represents a valid solution to the
    eight queens puzzle.</p>
