</div>Mobile phones may require passcodes to unlock, but people
    sometimes forget their passcodes. An alternative is the 9-pivot
    unlock pattern. Some people find such a graphical pattern
    easier to remember than a sequence of digits. Formally, an
    unlock pattern is a single stroke that visits each of the nine
    pivots exactly once. The pattern may start at any pivot. It may
    pass a pivot multiple times but only the first time counts as a
    visit. The phone unlocks if the pivots are visited in a
    predefined secret order.

    <p>A pattern is more complex if the total length of the stroke
    is longer. Given an unlock pattern, can you calculate its
    length? We assume that the pivots are aligned on a unit grid,
    and the stroke moves in a straight line between two consecutive
    pivots.</p>
<p>The sample input corresponds to the unlock pattern in the
    image.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input has three lines. Each line has three non-zero
    digits separated by a single space. The digits describe the
    order in which the pivots are visited. Every digit from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> appears exactly once.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the total length of the unlock pattern. Your answer
    is considered correct if it has an absolute or relative error
    of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> from
    the correct answer.</p>
