<p>There is a long electrical wire of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> centimetres between two poles
    where birds like to sit. After a long day at work you like to
    watch the birds on the wire from your balcony. Some time ago
    you noticed that they don’t like to sit closer than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> centimetres from each
    other. In addition, they cannot sit closer than 6 centimetres
    to any of the poles, since there are spikes attached to the
    pole to keep it clean from faeces that would otherwise damage
    and weaken it. You start wondering how many more birds can
    possibly sit on the wire.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Given numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, how many
    additional birds can sit on the wire given the positions of the
    birds already on the wire? For the purposes of this problem we
    assume that the birds have zero width.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains three space separated integers: the
    length of the wire <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell
    $</span>, distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> and
    number of birds <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    already sitting on the wire. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contain the positions of the
    birds in any order. All number are integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq \ell , d\leq 1\, 000\, 000\,
    000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq n\leq 20\,
    000$</span>. (If you have objections to the physical
    plausibility of fitting that many birds on a line hanging
    between two poles, you may either imagine that the height of
    the line is 0 cm above ground level, or that the birds are ants
    instead.) You can assume that the birds already sitting on the
    wire are at least 6 cm from the poles and at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> centimetres apart from each
    other.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with one integer – the maximal number of
    additional birds that can possibly sit on the wire.</p>
