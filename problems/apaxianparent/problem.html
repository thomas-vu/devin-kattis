<p>While breaking ground for the Obama Presidential Center,
    which will be located just a few blocks from campus in Jackson
    Park, archeologists from the Oriental Institute have made an
    astounding discovery: a new set of scrolls from the ancient and
    certainly not made-up Apaxian civilization!</p>
<p>It seems that the Apaxian civilization, which the Oriental
    Institute is starting to suspect may have been way too
    concerned with string manipulation, provided a way for young
    Apaxians to extend their name using the name of one of their
    parents. The basic principle was to take an Apaxian name
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, add <tt class="ttfamily">ex</tt>, and then the name <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> of one of the parents. For
    example, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> is
    <tt class="ttfamily">menolaxios</tt> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is <tt class="ttfamily">mox</tt>,
    the extended name is <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{menolaxios}+\texttt{ex}+\texttt{mox}=\texttt{menolaxiosexmox}$</span></p>
<p>However, there were a few exceptions to this rule:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> ends with
        <tt class="ttfamily">e</tt>, then the extended name is
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y+\texttt{x}+P$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> ends with
        any other vowel (<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>,<tt class="ttfamily">i</tt>,<tt class="ttfamily">o</tt>, or
        <tt class="ttfamily">u</tt>), we remove that final vowel
        from <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, and then
        extend <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> with
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{ex}+P$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> already ends
        with <tt class="ttfamily">ex</tt>, then the extended name
        is simply <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y+P$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, the Oriental Institute has asked us to help them
    apply the power of computation to generating these extended
    names.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains two strings separated by a single space:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, as defined above. Each string
    contains only lowercase English letters, and is at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> characters long and at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> characters
    long.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output is a single string containing the extended name,
    as defined above.</p>
