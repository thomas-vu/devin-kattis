<div class="problembody">
<p>A group of people are standing in a line. Each person has a
    distinct height. You would like to count the number of
    unordered pairs of people in the line such that they are taller
    than everyone in between them in the line.</p>
<p>More formally, let <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>
    be a sequence of the heights of the people in order from left
    to right. We want to count the number of pairs of indices
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$i&lt;j$</span> such that for all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$i &lt; k &lt; j$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i&gt;d_ k$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ j&gt;d_ k$</span>. Note that if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j=i+1$</span> (<em>i.e.</em>,
    there are no <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>’s between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>), it is trivially true.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le n \le 10^6$</span>), which is the number of people.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le d_ i \le n$</span>). These are the
    heights of the people in the group, in the order in which
    they’re standing. The sequence is guaranteed to be a
    permutation of the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the number of pairs of
    people who are taller than everyone between them.</p>
