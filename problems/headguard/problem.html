<p>You are the Head guard at the Royal Blue Mountain
    Castle.</p>
<p>Your job is simple: take a tally of how many types of
    critters came through which doors, and in what order.</p>
<p>The castle is renowned for its numerous doors, however
    sometimes they may or may not be open.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> lines. Each line contains a
    string of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span> lowercase English
    letters.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>On each line output the number of characters that went
    through in a row, formatted as a number immediately followed by
    the character. For example, if we have the string “<tt class="ttfamily">aaaabb</tt>” this becomes “<tt class="ttfamily">4a2b</tt>”. If the same character appears twice such
    as in “<tt class="ttfamily">aaabbaaa</tt>” then you do not
    combine this to become “<tt class="ttfamily">6a2b</tt>”: since
    the order is important to the guards, we must keep it as
    “<tt class="ttfamily">3a2b3a</tt>”.</p>
