<p>Alice and Bob love playing Don’tminion, which typically
    involves a lot of shuffling of decks of different sizes.
    Because they play so often, they are not only very quick at
    shuffling, but also very consistent. Each time Alice shuffles
    her deck, her cards get permuted in the same way, just like Bob
    always permutes his cards the same way when he shuffles them.
    This isn’t good for playing games, but raises an interesting
    question.</p>
<p>They know that if they take turns shuffling, then at some
    point the deck will end up ordered in the same way as when they
    started. Alice shuffles once first, then Bob shuffles once,
    then Alice shuffles again, et cetera. They start with a sorted
    deck. What they do not know, however, is how many shuffles it
    will take before the deck is sorted again.</p>
<p>Can you help them compute how many shuffles it will take? As
    Alice and Bob can only do <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{12}$</span> shuffles in the limited time
    they have, any number strictly larger than this should be
    returned as <tt class="ttfamily">huge</tt> instead.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 10^5$</span>, the number of
        cards in the deck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> distinct integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq a_1, a_2, \dotsc , a_ n \leq
        n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
        i$</span> is the new position of the card previously at
        position <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> when
        Alice shuffles the deck.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> distinct integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq b_1,b_2,\dotsc , b_ n\leq
        n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_
        i$</span> is the new position of the card previously at
        position <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> when Bob
        shuffles the deck.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Output a single positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m &gt; 0$</span>, the minimal number of
        shuffles required to sort the deck, or <tt class="ttfamily">huge</tt> when this number is strictly larger
        than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{12}$</span>.</p>
