<p>Erin is an engineer. She drives trains. She also arranges
    the cars within each train. She prefers to put the cars in
    decreasing order of weight, with the heaviest car at the front
    of the train.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, sorting train cars is not easy. One cannot
    simply pick up a car and place it somewhere else. It is
    impractical to insert a car within an existing train. A car may
    only be added to the beginning and end of the train.</p>
<p>Cars arrive at the train station in a predetermined order.
    When each car arrives, Erin can add it to the beginning or end
    of her train, or refuse to add it at all. The resulting train
    should be as long as possible, but the cars within it must be
    ordered by weight.</p>
<p>Given the weights of the cars in the order in which they
    arrive, what is the longest train that Erin can make?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq n \leq 2\, 000$</span>, the number of
    cars. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contains a non-negative
    integer smaller than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\,
    000$</span> giving the weight of a car. No two cars have the
    same weight.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer giving the number of cars in the
    longest train that can be made with the given restrictions.</p>
