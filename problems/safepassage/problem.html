<p>A group of friends snuck away from their school campus, but
    now they must return from the main campus gate to their dorm
    while remaining undetected by the many teachers who patrol the
    campus. Fortunately, they have an invisibility cloak, but it is
    only large enough to cover two people at a time. They will take
    turns as individuals or pairs traveling across campus under the
    cloak (and by necessity, returning the cloak to the gate if
    others remain). Each student has a maximum pace at which he or
    she is able to travel, yet if a pair of students are walking
    under the cloak together, they will have to travel at the pace
    of the slower of the two. Their goal is to have everyone back
    at the dorm as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>As an example, assume that there are four people in the
    group, with person A able to make the trip in <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> minute, person B able to
    travel in <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> minutes, person C able
    to travel in <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> minutes, and person D
    able to travel in <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> minutes. It is possible to
    get everyone to the dorm in <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span> minutes with the following
    plan:<br/></p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a single line beginning with an integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 15$</span>.
    Following that are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    positive integers that respectively represent the minimum time
    in which each person is able to cross the campus if alone;
    these times are measured in minutes, with each being at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5\, 000$</span>. (It is a very
    large campus!)</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum possible time it takes to get the entire
    group from the gate to the dorm.</p>
