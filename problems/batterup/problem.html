<p>While the Chicago Cubs were ecstatic with their 2016 World
    Series championship, they were eliminated from the playoffs in
    2017. Looking ahead to 2018 they are beginning to embrace the
    more data-driven analysis of player’s values known as
    Sabermetrics.</p>
<p>For example, a player’s batting average is calculated by
    dividing the total number of base hits by the total number of
    official at-bats. One limitation of using the batting average
    to evaluate players is that it treats all hits equally, rather
    than taking into account doubles, triples or home runs. For
    this reason, analysts often prefer to consider what is known as
    the <em>slugging percentage</em>, which distinguishes between
    different hit outcomes. To calculate the slugging percentage,
    the total number of <em>bases</em> of all hits is divided by
    the total numbers of time at bat, that did not result in walks,
    or <em>at-bats</em>.</p>
<p>More specifically, an at-bat can earn <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> bases (these are referred to as
    <em>official</em> at-bats). Furthermore, some at-bats, such as
    those that result in a base-on-balls (i.e., a “walk”) are not
    considered in either the player’s batting average or slugging
    percentage.</p>
<p>For example, if a player hits a triple (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> bases), strikes out
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> bases), and hits
    a double (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> bases),
    their slugging percentage would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{3+0+2}{3} \approx 1.6667$</span>. If a
    player hits a single (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> base), walks, and hits a home
    run (<span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> bases), the
    slugging level would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{1
    + 4}{2}=2.5$</span>. Notice that in this case, the denominator
    is two, not three, because the walk does not count towards the
    slugging percentage.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is composed of two lines. The first line contains
    a single positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 100$</span>) that specifies the number of at-bats.
    The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers, separated by spaces,
    each describing one of those at-bats. Strike-outs, singles,
    doubles, triples, and home runs are represented as <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">2</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">3</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">4</tt>, respectively. Walks are represented as
    <tt class="ttfamily">-1</tt>. You may assume that there will
    always be at least one official at-bat (i.e., at least one
    at-bat will <em>not</em> be a walk).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the player’s slugging percentage as a real number,
    accurate to within an absolute or relative error of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span>. We recommend
    that you do <em>not</em> round the value that you
    calculate.</p>
