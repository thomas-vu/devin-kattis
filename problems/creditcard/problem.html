<p>Using credit cards for your purchases is convenient, but
    they have high interest rates if you do not pay your balance in
    full each month.</p>
<p>The interest rate is commonly quoted in terms of “annual
    percentage rate” (APR) which is then applied to the outstanding
    balance each month. The APR can be converted to a monthly
    interest rate <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>. At the
    end of each month, the monthly interest rate is applied to the
    outstanding balance and the interest is added to the total
    balance. Any payment made will be applied to the balance in the
    following month. The monthly interest is rounded to the nearest
    cent (rounding up <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.5$</span>
    cent and above) in the calculations.</p>
<p>You have unfortunately accumulated an outstanding balance
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> at the end of the
    month and you can only afford to pay up to some amount
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> every month. If you do
    not make any more purchases with the credit card, what is the
    minimum number of payments needed to completely eliminate the
    outstanding balance? It is possible that you cannot pay off the
    balance in <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> years
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 200$</span> payments).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of
    input is a single integer, not more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>, indicating the number of
    test cases to follow. Each of the following lines specify the
    input for one case. Each line contains three positive real
    numbers separated by single spaces: <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>. The real numbers have two digits
    after the decimal point, satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$R \leq 50.00$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B, M \leq 50\, 000.00$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> is the monthly interest rate and
    is specified as a percentage.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, display on a line the minimum number of
    payments needed to eliminate the outstanding balance. If this
    cannot be done in at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\,
    200$</span> payments, print instead <tt>impossible</tt>.</p>
