</div>By now you have probably heard that there is a
    spectacular stone sculpture featuring four famous
    U.S. presidents at Mount Rushmore. However, very few
    people know that this monument contains a secret chamber. This
    sounds like something out of a plot of a Hollywood movie, but
    the chamber really exists. It can be found behind the head of
    Abraham Lincoln and was designed to serve as a Hall of Records
    to store important historical U.S. documents and
    artifacts. Historians claim that the construction of the hall
    was halted in 1939 and the uncompleted chamber was left
    untouched until the late 1990s, but this is not the whole
    truth.

    <p>In 1982, the famous archaeologist S. Dakota Jones
    secretly visited the monument and found that the chamber
    actually was completed, but it was kept confidential. This
    seemed suspicious and after some poking around, she found a
    hidden vault and some documents inside. Unfortunately, these
    documents did not make any sense and were all gibberish. She
    suspected that they had been written in a code, but she could
    not decipher them despite all her efforts.</p>
<p>Earlier this week when she was in the area to follow the
    ACM-ICPC World Finals, Dr. Jones finally discovered the
    key to deciphering the documents, in Connolly Hall of
    SDSM&amp;T. She found a document that contains a list of
    translations of letters. Some letters may have more than one
    translation, and others may have no translation. By repeatedly
    applying some of these translations to individual letters in
    the gibberish documents, she might be able to decipher them to
    yield historical U.S. documents such as the Declaration of
    Independence and the Constitution. She needs your help.</p>
<p>You are given the possible translations of letters and a
    list of pairs of original and deciphered words. Your task is to
    verify whether the words in each pair match. Two words match if
    they have the same length and if each letter of the first word
    can be turned into the corresponding letter of the second word
    by using the available translations zero or more times.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le m \le 500$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 50$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number of translations of
    letters and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the
    number of word pairs. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines contains two distinct
    space-separated letters <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, indicating that the letter
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> can be translated to
    the letter <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. Each
    ordered pair of letters <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a,
    b)$</span> appears at most once. Following this are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each containing
    a word pair to check. Translations and words use only lowercase
    letters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>’–‘<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>’, and each word contains at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> letters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each pair of words, display <tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt> if the two words match, and <tt class="ttfamily">no</tt> otherwise.</p>
