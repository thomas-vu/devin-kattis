<div class="problembody">
<p>Many people on Earth want to solve their housing. When they
    have not enough money to buy their house or flat, they get
    mortgage from some bank and then they pay fixed monthly
    payments until they redeem the mortgage.</p>
<p>You may think that paying mortgage for <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> years is a long time, but that is
    quite short time compared to galactic mortgages. Aliens are not
    buying houses, but whole planets. Since planets are a “little”
    more expensive, the mortgage periods are longer.</p>
<p>The mortgages work the same way for aliens as for us
    earthlings. If an alien wants to buy a planet, he comes to GCB
    (Galactic Central Bank) to borrow an amount of <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>. Bank offers a mortgage with the
    interest rate <span class="tex2jax_process">$r\% $</span> p.a.
    (= “per year”). Interests are computed at the end of each month
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> alien year has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> months). At the end
    of every month, the current debt is raised by <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r/12)\% $</span> and then the alien pays
    back to bank some fixed amount <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, which is subtracted from the
    debt.</p>
<p>Because of intergalactic financial crisis, bank rules are
    quite strict. Every mortgage must start on the first day of a
    year. If an alien does not pay enough money to cover the
    principal and interests within first <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> years, the bank will then
    confiscate his planet.</p>
<p>On the other hand, galactic employment works quite nice.
    Once you have a job, you are guaranteed to have it forever. An
    alien can give the same amount <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> at the end of each month for the
    whole mortgage period.</p>
<p>Your task is to decide whether an alien is able to pay his
    mortgage or not.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$400\ 000$</span> test cases. Each test case
    is described by a line containing numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> separated by space. <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is principal (the initial amount
    borrowed), <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> is the
    monthly payment (paid at the end of each month), <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is number of years in which the
    alien is required to pay the mortgage, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is interest rate p.a. in
    percent.</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> are integer numbers (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq X, Y \leq 1\ 000\ 000\ 000$</span>).
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is an integer number
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10\ 000$</span>).
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is a real number
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq r \leq 100$</span>, 2
    digits precision). Values <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> for each test case were chosen so
    that even if the alien would not pay anything for the whole
    time, the resulting debt after <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> year would be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{25}$</span> . Also, the precision of
    double should be sufficient for most computations (differences
    in the rate less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-8}\%
    $</span> will not affect the result).</p>
<p>The last test case is followed by a line containing four
    zeros.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case output “<tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt>” if
    the alien can pay the mortgage within <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> years and “<tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt>” if his salary is too small to pay the
    mortgage on time.</p>
