<p>Today’s computer architectures are moving away from single
    processing cores toward multiple cores. Due to this shift, many
    computer programmers are honing their parallel programming
    skills to take advantage of new hardware capabilities.</p>
<p>Writing efficient parallel programs can be difficult, but
    software tools can make the job easier for programmers. You
    have decided to write a program to help with the analysis of
    existing serial programs. Your program will take as input a
    trace of the executed instructions in a serial program and
    identify how fast it might run on a parallel platform with many
    cores.</p>
<p>Your program will measure the time to execute the trace on a
    shared-memory parallel architecture. Assume that every
    instruction executes in one clock tick, and that all cores
    share a single clock. The parallel execution time is measured
    from the beginning of execution until all instructions have
    finished. Thus, if a serial trace has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> executed instructions, it will
    take <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> clock ticks to
    execute on a single core. With <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> cores, execution time could be as
    short as <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lceil n/p\rceil
    $</span>, or as long as <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> clock ticks. The actual time will
    depend on how much parallelism is available in the trace – that
    is, how many instructions can be executed simultaneously.</p>
<p>Two instructions can be executed simultaneously if they do
    not have a <em>data dependency</em>. Suppose instruction
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> occurs after
    instruction <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> in the
    serial trace. Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> has
    a data dependency on <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>
    if <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> reads from a memory
    address that <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> writes
    to, and no intervening instruction writes to that memory
    address. This type of dependency is called read-after-write. If
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> has such a data
    dependency on <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>,
    instruction <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> must
    complete execution before <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> begins execution. If two
    instructions do not share a dependency, they may be executed in
    any order. For now, we will ignore other types of dependencies
    like write-after-write and write-after-read, since they can be
    handled by memory renaming techniques.</p>
<p>Execution traces are described in a simplified format that
    includes just the memory references of each instruction. This
    format ignores the semantics of the instructions executed (e.g.
    add, subtract) and the data values. Each instruction reads zero
    or more values from memory, and produces exactly 1 value and
    writes it to memory.</p>
<p>Here is an example trace. The middle column, which would be
    the input to your program, shows the number of memory
    references followed by the references for each instruction. The
    read addresses are first, followed by the write address. The
    right column gives pseudocode to help explain what these
    references mean.</p>

-------------------------------------------------------
A               2 1 0                     max &lt;- x
B               3 1 2 3                   if (y &gt; x)
C               3 3 2 0                       max &lt;- y
D               3 1 4 4                   a &lt;- a + x
E               3 2 4 4                   a &lt;- a + y
F               3 0 4 4                   a &lt;- a + max
</pre>
<p>In the trace given above, instruction B is not dependent on
    instruction A, so they can be executed in parallel (or out of
    order). Thus, if two cores were available, in one clock tick
    they could complete the first two instructions. Instructions D,
    E, and F must execute sequentially (due to dependencies
    involving memory address 4), but instruction D may start at any
    time. However, instruction F may not execute until instruction
    C has completed. Further investigation would yield other
    insights about data dependencies in this trace.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains multiple traces. The first line of input
    contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le t \le
    10$</span> indicating the number of traces that follow. Each
    trace starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n\leq 40\, 000$</span> indicating the length of the serial
    instruction trace. This will be followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each representing a single
    instruction in the serial execution order. Each line will start
    with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq
    20$</span>, indicating the number of memory references for that
    instruction, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> space-separated memory references
    for that instruction. The last reference for an instruction is
    always its write address. Every memory reference will be a
    decimal integer in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0,2^{31}-1]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each trace, print out the trace number and the minimum
    parallel run time for that trace running on <span class="tex2jax_process">$p=n$</span> cores. Follow the format shown
    in the sample output.</p>
