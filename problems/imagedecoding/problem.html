<div class="problembody">
<p>You have been placed in charge of your company’s archive of
    digital data, and your first job is to convert a lot of old
    pictures into a newer format. But you have no software to read
    the old images, so you need to write it.</p>
<p>You do have a description of the old image format. The old
    images are 1-bit images (each pixel is either on or off) and
    are in a simple compressed format. The compression is a form of
    run-length encoding, which is popular because it runs
    efficiently on older hardware.</p>
<p>For each encoded image, produce a rendered version so that
    you can visually inspect it. You should also detect errors in
    the original encoded image, if there are any.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a sequence of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> images. Each image starts with a
    line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 100$</span> indicating the number of scanlines in
    the image. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain one scanline.
    Each scanline starts with either ‘<tt class="tt">.</tt>’ or
    ‘<tt class="tt">#</tt>’, indicating the value of the first
    pixel on the scanline. Following this are up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> integers each in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1,100]$</span> indicating the
    lengths of each subsequent run of pixels. Each scanline has at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> total
    pixels (the sum of the integers on the line). Each run uses
    only one pixel value, which alternates between ‘<tt class="tt">.</tt>’ and ‘<tt class="tt">#</tt>’ with each run. Input
    ends with a line containing just the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each image, decode and output image according to
    run-length encoding. In other words, for each scanline, expand
    each run of pixels of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> into <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> copies of that pixel value.</p>
<p>Some images may not have the same number of pixels output
    for all decoded scanlines. This is an error condition, which
    your program should identify by producing a line after the
    image with the text ‘<tt class="tt">Error decoding
    image</tt>’.</p>
<p>Separate adjacent images with a blank line.</p>
