<p>You have been hired by a fitness center. You are helping to
    develop a system to monitor customer heart rate during
    exercise. While the customer stays in the gym, their heart rate
    is recorded at 10-minute intervals. When they leave, they can
    get a report of their average heart rate for the entire visit.
    Your job is to generate this report.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a series of lines, one for each customer.
    Customers can scan their ID card when they enter or when they
    leave, so each line has a customer name either at the start or
    at the end. Other than the customer name, each line contains a
    sequence of real values in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0, 1000]$</span> with at most 2 digits past
    the decimal representing heart rate measurements throughout the
    workout. Customer names consists of one of more space-separated
    words, each consisting of letters A - Z (lower or uppercase).
    Each customer only appears once in the input. There are at most
    25 space-separated tokens (names or numbers) per line. Each
    token has at most 10 characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each customer in the order given in the input, print a
    line with the average of all their heart rate readings,
    followed by the name. The average heart rate should be accurate
    within 0.01 beats per minute.</p>
