<p>A friend of yours who is working as a waiter has a problem.
    A group of xkcd-fans have started to come to the restaurant and
    order food as in the comic strip below. Each order takes him a
    lot of time to figure out, but maybe you can help him.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>You are to write a program that finds out what was ordered
    given the total cost of the order and the cost of each item on
    the menu.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line containing one integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 100$</span>), the number of
    items on the menu. The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space-separated positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1, c_2, \dots , c_ n$</span>,
    denoting the cost of each item on the menu in Swedish kronor.
    No item costs more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\,
    000$</span> SEK.</p>
<p>This is followed by a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq m\leq 1\, 000$</span>), the number of
    orders placed, and a line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> orders. Each order is given as an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq s\leq 30\, 000$</span>), the total
    cost of all ordered items in SEK.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each order in the input output one line as follows. If
    there is one unique order giving the specified total cost,
    output a space-separated list of the numbers of the items on
    that order in ascending order. If the order contains more than
    one of the same item, print the corresponding number the
    appropriate number of times. The first item on the menu has
    number 1, the second 2, and so on.</p>
<p>If there doesnâ€™t exist an order that gives the specified
    sum, output <tt>Impossible</tt>. If there are more than one
    order that gives the specified sum, output
    <tt>Ambiguous</tt>.</p>
