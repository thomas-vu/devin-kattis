<p>One of our delivery robots is malfunctioning! The job of the
    robot is simple; it should follow a list of instructions in
    order to reach a target destination. The list of instructions
    is originally correct to get the robot to the target. However,
    something is going wrong as we upload the instructions into the
    robot’s memory. During the upload, one random instruction from
    the list takes on a different value than intended. Yes, there
    is <em>always</em> a single bad instruction in the robot’s
    memory and it <em>always</em> results in the robot arriving at
    an incorrect destination as it finishes executing the list of
    instructions.</p>
<p>The robot can execute the instructions “<tt class="ttfamily">Left</tt>”, “<tt class="ttfamily">Right</tt>”, and
    “<tt class="ttfamily">Forward</tt>”. The “<tt class="ttfamily">Left</tt>” and “<tt class="ttfamily">Right</tt>”
    instructions do not result in spatial movement but result in a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span>-degree turn in the
    corresponding direction. “<tt class="ttfamily">Forward</tt>” is
    the only instruction that results in spatial movement, causing
    the robot to move one unit in the direction it is facing. The
    robot always starts at the origin <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span> of a grid and faces north
    along the positive y-axis.</p>
<p>Given the coordinates of the target destination and the list
    of instructions that the robot has in its memory, you are to
    identify a correction to the instructions to help the robot
    reach the proper destination.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> integer coordinates of the target
    destination, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$-50 \leq x
    \leq 50$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$-50 \leq y
    \leq 50$</span>. The following line contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> representing the
    number of instructions in the list, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 50$</span>. The remaining
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain a
    single instruction. These instructions may be: “<tt class="ttfamily">Left</tt>”, “<tt class="ttfamily">Forward</tt>”, or
    “<tt class="ttfamily">Right</tt>”.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Identify how to correct the robot’s instructions by printing
    the line number (starting at <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>) of an incorrect input
    instruction, followed by an instruction substitution that would
    make the robot reach the target destination. If there are
    multiple ways to fix the instructions, report the fix that
    occurs for the earliest line number in the sequence of
    instructions. There is always exactly one unique earliest
    fix.</p>
