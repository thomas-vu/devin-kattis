        Illustration of Sample Input 3
      </div>
</div>
<p>Yancy is designing a new board game called Colorland. The
    rules of Colorland are as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Colorland’s board is a linear sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N+1$</span> squares. The first square is
        a special start square, the remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> squares are colored blue,
        orange, pink, green, red, or yellow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The goal of Colorland is to move your game piece from
        the start square to square <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Players take turns drawing from a shuffled deck of
        cards. Each card has a single color on it. A player moves
        to the nearest square after their current square with the
        color indicated by the drawn card.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there are no squares of the drawn color after a
        player’s current square, that player’s piece does not move
        and their turn ends.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Yancy is interested in the length of play required for
    different board layouts. She would like to know the smallest
    number of cards any one player would have to draw to complete
    the game.</p>
<p>For instance, the board for Sample Input 3 is [<tt class="ttfamily">Start</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Blue</tt>,
    <tt class="ttfamily">Orange</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Pink</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Green</tt>,
    <tt class="ttfamily">Red</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Yellow</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Yellow</tt>,
    <tt class="ttfamily">Yellow</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Yellow</tt>]. The best first draw is <tt class="ttfamily">Yellow</tt> which advances a player from Start to
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$6^\text {th}$</span> square.
    From the <span class="tex2jax_process">$6^\text {th}$</span>
    square to the end, only a <tt class="ttfamily">Yellow</tt> draw
    will advance the player. Therefore the smallest number of draws
    is <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 200\, 000$</span>) denoting the
    number of squares. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each contain a single string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ i \in \{ \text {Blue}, \text
    {Orange}, \text {Pink}, \text {Green}, \text {Red}, \text
    {Yellow}\} $</span> representing the color of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span> square, starting with
    the first square on the board (not counting the start
    square).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer equal to the minimum number of draws
    required to move from the start square to square <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
