<div class="problembody">
<p>You’re a top government spy currently at a secret location
    behind enemy lines (ooooh....exciting!). You have a
    communication device that allows you to stay in contact with
    various other operatives that you work with. The broadcast
    range of the device is adjustable and ideally you would set it
    at its maximum value to be able to reach the largest number of
    operatives. Unfortunately, the enemy is not stupid and has a
    set of listening devices that can detect your signal. These
    listening devices each have a fixed range (which can vary from
    device to device), and in order to pinpoint your location the
    enemy must detect you on at least three of their listening
    devices. Therefore, you are safe as long as you set your
    broadcast range so that at most two listening devices can
    detect you. A listening device can detect you if your broadcast
    range and its listening range touch at more than one point.</p>
<p>An example situation is shown below. Your device and its
    broadcast area are shown in the grey circle, and four listening
    devices and their detecting areas are shown in the white
    circles. On the far left you have set your broadcast range so
    that none of the listening devices can detect you, but clearly
    you could increase your range. In the middle picture you’ve
    increased it so that two of the listening devices can detect
    you, but that’s fine. In the right picture, you’ve increased
    your range too much since now three of the listening devices
    can detect you.</p>

<p>Given your location and the locations and detection ranges
    of a set of listening devices, determine the maximum broadcast
    range for your communication device. Note that this range may
    be <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> if the broadcast
    device it already within the range of three listening
    devices.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line containing three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$cx$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$cy$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$(cx, cy)$</span> is your location and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq n \leq 100$</span> is the
    number of listening devices. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> is the location of a listening
    device and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; r \leq 1\,
    000$</span> is the radius of its listening area. All
    coordinates are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1\,
    000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>.
    All <span class="tex2jax_process">$n+1$</span> locations are
    distinct.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the radius of the maximum broadcast area, rounding
    down to the nearest integer.</p>
