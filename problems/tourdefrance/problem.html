<div class="problembody">
<p>A racing bicycle is driven by a chain connecting two
    sprockets. Sprockets are grouped into two clusters: the front
    cluster (typically consisting of 2 or 3 sprockets) and the rear
    cluster (typically consisting of between 5 and 10 sprockets).
    At any time the chain connects one of the front sprockets to
    one of the rear sprockets. The drive ratio – the ratio of the
    angular velocity of the pedals to that of the wheels – is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n/m$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of teeth on the rear
    sprocket and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the
    number of teeth on the front sprocket. Two drive ratios
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_1 &lt; d_2$</span> are
    adjacent if there is no other drive ratio <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_1 &lt; d_3 &lt; d_2$</span>. The spread
    between a pair of drive ratios <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_1 &lt; d_2$</span> is their quotient:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_2/d_1$</span>. You are to
    compute the maximum spread between two adjacent drive ratios
    achieved by a particular pair of front and rear clusters.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of several test cases, followed by a line
    containing 0. Each test case is specified by the following
    input:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>: the number of
        sprockets in the front cluster;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>: the number of
        sprockets in the rear cluster;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> integers, each
        giving the number of teeth on one of the gears in the front
        cluster;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> integers, each
        giving the number of teeth on one of the gears in the rear
        cluster.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may assume that no cluster has more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> sprockets and that no gear has
    fewer than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> or more
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> teeth.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the maximum spread rounded to two
    decimal places.</p>
