<div class="problembody">
<p>Some numbers are just, well, odd. For example, the number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> is odd, because it is
    not a multiple of two. Numbers that are a multiple of two are
    not odd, they are even. More precisely, if a number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> can be expressed as
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = 2 \cdot k$</span> for some
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is even. For example,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6 = 2 \cdot 3$</span> is
    even.</p>
<p>Some people get confused about whether numbers are odd or
    even. To see a common example, do an internet search for the
    query “is zero even or odd?” (Don’t search for this now! You
    have a problem to solve!)</p>
<p>Write a program to help these confused people.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 20$</span> on a line by
    itself, indicating the number of test cases that follow. Each
    of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    contain a test case consisting of a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10 \leq x \leq 10$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, print
    either ‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is odd’ or
    ‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is even’ depending on
    whether <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is odd or
    even.</p>
