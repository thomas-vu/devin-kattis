<p>Jack the Lumberjack used to love chopping down trees. Jack
    is getting older and is becoming tired of this activity he used
    to love. He thinks of an idea, ‘The Big One’, and fantasizes
    about going out into the forest one last time to harvest as
    many trees as possible.</p>
<p>Jack calls the forest administrator for his local evergreen
    forest. The forest administrator tells him about how the
    population changes for each species of tree. For each species
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ k$</span> trees are planted in year
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ k$</span>. For the next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y_ k$</span> years, the
    population increases by <span class="tex2jax_process">$I_
    k$</span> per year. After <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y_
    k$</span> years, it will decrease by the same amount
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$I_ k$</span> per year, until
    possibly dying out.</p>
<p>Armed with this information, Jack wants to figure out the
    maximum amount of trees that could be harvested at once from
    now until the future. If he is no longer around to do it, his
    descendants will be!</p>
<p>Assume all populations change instantly and at the same
    time, once per year. Jack would assess each population’s size
    after the yearly change occurred.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single test case. The first line
    contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 1\, 000$</span>)
    representing the number of tree species in the forest.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines represents a single tree
    species population. Each of these population lines contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> integer numbers
    <tt class="ttfamily">Y I S B</tt> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le Y \le 1\, 000\, 000$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le I \le 1\, 000$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le S \le 1\, 000\,
    000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le B \le 1\,
    000\, 000$</span>). where <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is the starting population size,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> the year in which the
    population is planted, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>
    the number of years during which the population increases each
    year by <span class="tex2jax_process">$I$</span> before it
    decreases by <span class="tex2jax_process">$I$</span> until it
    (possibly) dies out.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the maximum amount of trees that can be harvested in
    any single year.</p>
