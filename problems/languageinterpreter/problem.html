<div class="problembody">
<p>When preparing for the CS3233 Final Team Contest, we (the
    problem setters) realized that one of the problems can be
    easily solved by using our custom programming language. Right
    after that realization, we decided to simply replace that
    problem with this one — write the interpreter for our
    programming language!</p>
<p>Our programming language is quite simple and was inspired by
    the assembly language. There are only 32 local variables (i.e.,
    the registers), denoted by <tt class="ttfamily">r0</tt>,
    <tt class="ttfamily">r1</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">r2</tt>, …,
    <tt class="ttfamily">r31</tt>.</p>
<p>The instructions are as follows (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x, y, z \leq 31$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq c \leq 2^{32}-1$</span>). We denote
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i+1)$</span>-th register by
    <tt class="ttfamily">r<span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span></tt>.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">add r<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, r<span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, r<span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span></tt> — this instruction adds
        the value contained in register <tt class="ttfamily">r<span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span></tt>
        and the value contained in register <tt class="ttfamily">r<span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span></tt>,
        and stores the result in register <tt class="ttfamily">r<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span></tt>.
        In other words, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{r$x$} \gets \texttt{r$y$} +
        \texttt{r$z$}$</span>. Note that it is possible that
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = z$</span>, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$y = z$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">addi r<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, r<span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span></tt> — this instruction adds
        the value contained in register <tt class="ttfamily">r<span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span></tt>
        and the constant <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>,
        and stores the result in register <tt class="ttfamily">r<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span></tt>.
        In other words, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{r$x$} \gets \texttt{r$y$} +
        c$</span>. Note that it is possible that <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = y$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">move r<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, r<span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span></tt> — this instruction copies
        the value contained in register <tt class="ttfamily">r<span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span></tt>
        to register <tt class="ttfamily">r<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span></tt>. In other words,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{r$x$} \gets
        \texttt{r$y$}$</span>. Note that it is possible that
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = y$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">li r<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span></tt> — this instruction sets
        the value of register <tt class="ttfamily">r<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span></tt> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>. In other words, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{r$x$} \gets c$</span>. Note that
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is a constant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">for <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span></tt> — this instruction starts
        a for-loop. The instructions inside the for-loop will be
        executed <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> times.
        Note that <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is a
        constant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">rof</tt> — this instruction ends
        the innermost for-loop. It is guaranteed that there is an
        open for-loop when this instruction is encountered, and
        every opened for-loop will be closed by this
        instruction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, each register can only store integers in the
    range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0, 2^{32}-1]$</span>. If
    the result of an operation is outside this range, it will be
    wrapped around. In other words, every operation is performed
    modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{32}$</span>.</p>
<p>Given the instructions in our programming language, your
    task is to execute the instructions and output the value of all
    registers after the execution.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, denoting the number of
    instructions and the number of registers used in the program
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100$</span>;
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq 32$</span>). The
    registers are numbered from <tt class="ttfamily">r0</tt> to
    <tt class="ttfamily">r</tt><span class="tex2jax_process">$(k-1)$</span>.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{32}-1$</span> (inclusive), denoting the
    initial values of the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> registers. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i+1)$</span>-th integer is the initial
    value of register <tt class="ttfamily">r<span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span></tt>.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    contain the instructions. All instructions are guaranteed to be
    valid and formatted as described above. The instructions are
    guaranteed to be well-formed, i.e., every <tt class="ttfamily">for</tt> instruction will have a corresponding
    <tt class="ttfamily">rof</tt> instruction. For each
    instruction, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x, y, z \le
    k-1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le c \le
    2^{32}-1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> integers, denoting the value of
    the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> registers
    after the program is executed. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i+1)$</span>-th integer should be the value
    of register <tt class="ttfamily">r<span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span></tt>.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample Input</h2>
<p>The program in the sample is equivalent to the following
    Python program:</p>
<pre>
r0, r1, r2 = 1, 2, 3
r0 = r0 + r0
r0 = r1 + 1
r1 = 100
for i in range(2):
    for j in range(3):
        r2 = r0 + r1
        r1 = r2
    for j in range(4):
        r2 = r0 + r2
        r1 = r2
        r0 = r0
r2 = 4234
r2 = (r2 + 4294966295) % (1 &lt;&lt; 32)
print(r0, r1, r2)
