<div class="problembody">
<p>In an epic but tiny pirate game, several players compete for
    resources in order to gain a large enough booty to bury at
    deserted islands. After pillaging resources from peaceful
    settlements, players need to visit the bazaar in order to
    exchange their goods for pieces o’ eight to add to their
    booty.</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$2N$</span>
    different goods in the game, each of a different type such as
    coffee, silk and sugarcane. The bazaar has the following
    mechanism for setting the prices of each good. There is always
    exactly one good that is priced <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> pieces o’ eight, for each positive
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> such that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i \le 2N$</span>. At the
    start of the game, the prices of the goods are arbitrarily
    assigned. Whenever a pirate sells a good priced <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, its new price becomes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and any good
    previously priced <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le j &lt; i$</span> has
    its price set to <span class="tex2jax_process">$j +
    1$</span>.</p>
<p>Two players are in the endgame phase of a match, and are now
    rapidly trying to sell off all their pillaged goods. At the
    moment, each player is in possession of exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> goods. A player can only exchange
    a single good per turn, after which the turn passes over to the
    other player. Given the current prices of the goods and what
    goods each player has, your task is to compute the difference
    between the amount of pieces o’ eight the players receive, if
    they are playing optimally. Optimal play means that if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> are the numbers of pieces o’ eight
    the first and second player receives respectively, player
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> tries to maximize
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A - B$</span>, while player
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> tries to maximize
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B - A$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the even integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$2N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le 2N \le 100\, 000$</span>), the number of types of goods in
    the game.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, \dots , a_ N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a_ i \le 2N$</span>), the
    prices of the goods that the first player has. This is followed
    by a line of the same format containing the prices of goods
    that the second player has.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer: the number of pieces o’ eight the
    first player receives minus the number of pieces o’ eight the
    second player receives, if playing optimally as described in
    the statement.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>Your solution will be tested on a set of test groups, each
    worth a number of points. To get the points for a test group
    you need to solve all test cases in the test group.</p>

<h2>Explanation of sample 3</h2>
<p>At the start of the game, the goods of the first player are
    priced <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and those of the
    second player are priced <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>. One optimal strategy is for the
    first player to start by selling the good priced <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, which increases the price of
    their remaining good to <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>. The second player can then sell
    the good priced <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>,
    increasing the price of the first player’s good to <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and the price of second player’s
    remaining good to <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>. The
    two players then sell their remaining good at prices
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>.</p>
<p>The first player receives a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 + 3 = 5$</span> pieces o’ eight, while the
    second one gets a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$4 + 4
    = 8$</span> pieces o’ eight, o the answer is <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 - 8 = -3$</span>.</p>
