        The Arranging Hat. Image by Lisa Abose
      </div>
</div><em>Arranging Hat</em> is a cushy job indeed; high impact
    work, absolute authority, and 364 days of holiday every year.
    However, the hat has decided that it can do even better—it
    would like very much to become a tenured professor.

    <p>Recently the hat has been reading computer science papers in
    its ample spare time, and of course, being an arranging hat, it
    is particularly interested in learning more about sorting
    algorithms.</p>
<p>The hat’s new contribution is to a class of algorithms known
    as <em>lossy</em> sorting algorithms. These usually work by
    removing some of the input elements in order to make it easier
    to sort the input (e.g., the Dropsort algorithm), instead of
    sorting all the input.</p>
<p>The hat is going to go one better—it is going to invent a
    lossy sorting algorithm for numbers that does not remove any
    input numbers and even keeps them in their original place, but
    instead changes some of the digits in the numbers to make the
    list sorted.</p>
<p>The lossiness of the sorting operation depends on how many
    digits are changed. What is the smallest number of digits that
    need to be changed in one such list of numbers, to ensure that
    it is sorted?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line containing the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 40$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le 400$</span>), the number of
        numbers and the number of digits in each number,
        respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
        containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le v &lt; 10^{m}$</span>). The
        numbers are zero-padded to exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> digits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Write a sorted version of the array, after making a minimum
    number of digit changes to make the numbers sorted (the numbers
    must remain zero-padded to <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> digits). If there are multiple
    optimal solutions, you may give any of them.</p>
