<div class="problembody">
<p>You are given a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and should print the prime number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$&lt; n$</span> that can be
    written as the sum of the greatest number of consecutive
    primes.</p>
<p>For example <span class="tex2jax_process">$41$</span> can be
    written as <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 11 +
    13$</span> and it can be seen that <span class="tex2jax_process">$41$</span> is the prime <span class="tex2jax_process">$&lt; n$</span> that can be written as the
    sum of the most consecutive primes. Note that the sum does not
    have to begin with the prime <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100 \leq n \leq 5 \cdot
    10^{6}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the prime <span class="tex2jax_process">$&lt;
    n$</span> that can be written as the sum of the most
    consecutive primes. If there are ties print the smallest
    number.</p>
