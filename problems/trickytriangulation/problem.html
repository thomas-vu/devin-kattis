<p>Amy is trying to find a stronghold by using Eyes of Ender.
    When thrown, Eyes of Ender fly in the direction of the closest
    stronghold. However, since Eyes of Ender have a chance of
    breaking when thrown, Amy wants to limit the number of throws
    she makes. So, she attempts to locate the stronghold by only
    using 2 throws.</p>
<p>In Minecraft, locations are represented by block
    coordinates, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span>,
    where both <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> are integer values.
    Amy is able to record the block coordinates at which she makes
    her throws, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1)$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2, y_2)$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$- 10^{9} \leq x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2
    \leq 10^{9}$</span>. However, she is unable to accurately
    locate where the Eyes of Ender land after thrown. Instead, she
    walks in the direction of the thrown Eyes of Ender for some
    distance, and records the block coordinates at which she stops,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1^\prime , y_1^\prime
    )$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2^\prime ,
    y_2^\prime )$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$-
    10^{9} \leq x_1^\prime , y_1^\prime , x_2^\prime , y_2^\prime
    \leq 10^{9}$</span>. It is possible that Amy overshot the
    location of the stronghold as she walks in the direction of the
    thrown Eyes of Ender, but she may still be able to find the
    stronghold in this case.</p>
<p>Given these coordinates, write a program to determine if
    there is a unique stronghold location determined by the two
    throws, and if so, what the coordinates of the stronghold
    are.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The only line of input contains the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, y_1, x_1^\prime , y_1^\prime , x_2,
    y_2, x_2^\prime , y_2^\prime $</span>, each separated by a
    space (<span class="tex2jax_process">$- 10^{9} \leq x_1, y_1,
    x_1^\prime , y_1^\prime , x_2, y_2, x_2^\prime , y_2^\prime
    \leq 10^{9}$</span>). It is guaranteed that the start and end
    locations for each throw are distinct, and she never starts a
    throw at the same coordinates as the stronghold.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If there is exactly one possible location for a stronghold
    based on the two throws, print the block coordinates
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ a, y_ a)$</span> for this
    location, rounded down to the nearest integer (<span class="tex2jax_process">$- 10^{9} \leq x_ a, y_ a \leq
    10^{9}$</span>). Otherwise, print <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
