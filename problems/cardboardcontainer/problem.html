</div>Fidget spinners are <em>so</em> 2017; this yearâ€™s rage
    are fidget cubes. A fidget cube is a cube with unit side
    lengths, which you hold in your hand and fidget with. Kids
    these days, right?
    <p>You work in the planning department for a company that
    creates and ships fidget cubes. Having done some market
    analysis, you found that your customers want to receive
    shipments of <em>exactly</em> <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> fidget cubes.</p>
<p>This means you have to design a container that will hold
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> fidget cubes.
    Since fidget cubes are very fragile, you cannot have any empty
    space in your container. If there is empty space, they might
    move around, bump into each other and get damaged. Because of
    this, you decide to ship the fidget cubes in a rectangular
    cardboard box.</p>
<p>The cost of a cardboard box is proportional to its surface
    area, costing exactly one unit of money per square unit of
    surface area. Of course you want to spend as little money as
    possible. Subject to the above constraints, how much money do
    you have to spend on a box for <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> fidget cubes?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq V \leq 10^6$</span>, the number of
    fidget cubes for which you need to build a box.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the cost of the cheapest rectangular box as specified
    in the statement.</p>
