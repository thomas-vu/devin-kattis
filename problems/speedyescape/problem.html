<p>The Newton brothers are planning to rob a bank in the city
    of Alviso and want to figure out a way to escape the city’s
    only police car. They know that their car is faster than the
    police car so if they could just reach one of the highways
    exiting the city they will be able to speed away from the
    police.</p>
<p>The police car has a maximum speed of 160 km/h. Luckily, the
    brothers know where the police car will start (it’s parked at
    the police station). To be on the safe side they assume that
    the police car will start moving as soon as they leave the bank
    and start their car (this is when the alarm goes off).</p>
<p>The brothers want to find a fixed route that ensures that
    they are able to leave the city no matter what route the police
    car take and at what speed it drives. However, since the
    brothers are not very confident drivers they don’t want to
    drive faster than necessary. Luckily they have recently
    invested in a new hi-tech in-car police escape system that
    <em>you</em> have constructed. This system will tell them what
    the minimal top speed needed to escape is (and probably other
    useful things like what route to take).</p>
<p>Let’s turn the clock back a bit to the time when you were
    constructing the escape system and focused on finding the
    minimal required speed. Can you get it right?</p>
<p><i class="itshape">You may treat all roads as
    infinitesimally narrow and both cars as point objects. If the
    brothers ever end up at the same point (on any road or
    intersection) at the same time as the police car they will be
    caught and by Murphy’s law if there is any possibility of this
    happening it will happen. The two cars start simultaneously and
    can accelerate/decelerate instantaneously at any time to any
    speed below or equal to its maximum speed. They can also change
    roads at intersections or direction anywhere on a road
    instantaneously no matter what speed they are traveling
    at.</i></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le n \le 100$</span> describe the number
    of intersections, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le
    5\, 000$</span> describes the number of roads in the city and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le e \le n$</span> describes
    the number of highway exits. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each consisting of three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a,b,l$</span> such that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a &lt; b \le n$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le l \le 100$</span>
    describing a road of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> hundred meters from intersection
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> to intersection
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. Then follows a line
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> integers, each one
    a number in <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, \ldots ,
    n$</span> describing which intersections are connected to
    highway exits. Finally there is a line with two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le b,p \le n \text { and } b \neq p$</span>) describing the
    intersections where the brothers and the police cars start,
    respectively.</p>
<p><i class="itshape">It will always be possible to travel from
    any intersection to any other intersection. Roads are only
    connected at intersection points (although they may cross using
    bridges or tunnels at others points). Roads can be used in both
    directions but there cannot be more than one road between two
    intersections.</i></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The minimal speed in km/h required to escape or the word
    <tt class="ttfamily">IMPOSSIBLE</tt> if it is impossible. In
    the first case any answer with either absolute or relative
    error smaller than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> is acceptable.</p>
