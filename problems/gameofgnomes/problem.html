</div>The enemy and their massive army is approaching your
    fortress, and all you have to defend it is a legion of guardian
    gnomes. There is no hope of winning the battle, so your focus
    will instead be on causing as much damage as possible to the
    enemy.
    <p>You have <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> gnomes at
    your disposal. Before the battle, they must be divided into at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> non-empty groups.
    The battle will then proceed in turns. Each turn, your gnomes
    will attack the enemy, causing one unit of damage for each
    living gnome. Then the enemy will attack by throwing a
    lightning bolt at one of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> groups. The lightning bolt kills
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> of the gnomes in that
    group, or all of them if the number of living gnomes in the
    group is less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>.
    The battle ends when all gnomes are dead. The enemy will always
    throw the lightning bolts in an optimal way such that the total
    damage caused by the gnomes is minimized.</p>
<p>Now you wonder, what is the maximum amount of damage you can
    cause to the enemy if you divide the gnomes into groups in an
    optimal way?</p>
<p>For example, if as in Sample Input 1 you have <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=10$</span> gnomes that are to be divided
    into <span class="tex2jax_process">$m=4$</span> groups, and the
    lightning bolt does at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$k=3$</span> damage, then an optimal solution
    would be to create one large group of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> and three small groups of size
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. In the first round,
    you cause <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> damage and
    the lightning bolt reduces the large group by <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. In the next round, you cause
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> damage and the large
    group is reduced down to size <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. In the remaining four rounds you
    do <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> damage respectively and the
    lightning bolt removes one group each round. In total you do
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10+7+4+3+2+1 = 27$</span>
    damage.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing the three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 10^9$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m,
    k \le 10^7$</span>), with meanings as described above.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum amount of damage you can cause to the
    enemy.</p>
