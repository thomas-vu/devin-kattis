<p>The world is made up of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> kinds of people, those who
    understand binary and those who do not. These different kinds
    of people do not always get along so well. Bob might ask for a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10000$</span> ounce coffee
    (meaning binary) and Alice might make misinterpret his request
    as being in decimal and give him a <span class="tex2jax_process">$10011100010000$</span> ounce coffee
    (binary). After Sue explains that this much coffee costs
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> dollars (decimal),
    Bob might assume he only has to pay <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> dollars (interpreting the price as
    being in binary). In response to these differences that are
    difficult to resolve, these two groups have divided the world
    into two regions, the binary-friendly zones and the
    decimal-friendly zones. They have even published a map like the
    following to help people keep up with where the areas are (they
    have used ones and zeros so nobody would have trouble reading
    it).</p>
<center>
<tt>1111100000</tt><br/>
<tt>1111000000</tt><br/>
<tt>1110000011</tt><br/>
<tt>0111100111</tt><br/>
<tt>0011111111</tt>
</center>
<p>Users of binary have to stay in the zones marked with a
    zero. Users of decimal have to stay in the zones marked with a
    one. You have to figure out if it is possible for either type
    of person to get between various locations of interest. People
    can move north, south, east or west, but cannot move
    diagonally.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line containing two positive integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le r \le 1\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le c \le 1\, 000$</span>. The
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> input lines give
    the contents of the map, each line containing exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> characters (which are
    all chosen from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> or
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>).</p>
<p>The next line has an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>. The following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain one
    query, given as four integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_1,c_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_2,c_2$</span>. These two pairs indicate
    two locations on the map, and their limits are <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le r_1, r_2 \le r$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le c_1, c_2 \le
    c$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query, output <tt class="ttfamily">binary</tt> if a
    binary user can start from location <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_1, c_1$</span> and move to location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_2, c_2$</span>. Output
    <tt class="ttfamily">decimal</tt> if a decimal user can move
    between the two locations. Otherwise, output <tt class="ttfamily">neither</tt>.</p>
