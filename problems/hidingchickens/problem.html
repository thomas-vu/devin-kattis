<p>“Weeeee,” says the fox after breaking in to the roost and
    killing all the chickens. Then he realizes that he has killed
    way more chickens then he can eat right now and hence he
    decides to hide them in already existing hiding spots nearby.
    The fox can only carry two hens at a time and every hiding spot
    can fit at most one. As he is already tired after all the
    killing, he wants you to compute the minimum distance he has to
    walk to hide all of the dead chickens.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input gives the position of the roost as
    two real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> on a single line. The
    next line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 20$</span>, giving the number of hiding spots and
    dead chickens. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, each line consisting of two
    real numbers giving the coordinates of a hiding spot. All
    coordinate values are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> and given with <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>-digit precision.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single line with a floating point number, the minimum
    distance the fox has to walk to hide all the chickens. Any
    answer with an error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> will be judged as
    correct.</p>
