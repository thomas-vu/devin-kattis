<p>You’d like to figure out whether a car was speeding while it
    was driving down a straight road. Unfortunately, you don’t have
    any radar guns or related instruments for measuring speed
    directly; all you have are photographs taken of the car at
    various checkpoints on the road at various times. Given when
    and where these photographs were taken, what is the fastest
    speed that you can prove the car must have been going at some
    point along the road?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le n \le 100$</span>), which is the number of photographs
    taken.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contains two space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le t \le 10^4$</span>) and<br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le d \le 10^6$</span>), where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> is the time of the
    photograph in hours, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is the distance along the road in
    miles. The first photograph is always taken at time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> with distance
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, and both the times
    and distances strictly increase.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the greatest integral
    speed that you can be certain the car was going at some point
    in miles per hour.</p>
