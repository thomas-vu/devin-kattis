<div class="problembody">
<p>As you already know from the previous problem, ‘Breaking
    Cake’, the first round of the Hunter Exam has begun.</p>
<p>The following paragraphs are copied from the problem
    statement of ‘Breaking Cake’:</p>
<blockquote class="quotation">
<p>The first round of the Hunter Exam is a real-life problem
      solving test: Each candidate is given a rectangular
      parallelepiped cake of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$a
      \cdot b \cdot c$</span>, which can be divided into unit cubes
      of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \cdot 1 \cdot
      1$</span>.</p>
<p>Inside the cake, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> unit cubes containing chocolate
      chips. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th cube
      is located at position <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i,
      y_ i, z_ i)$</span>.</p>
<p>The candidates must divide their given cake into exactly
      <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> rectangular
      parallelepiped parts, satisfying all the following
      conditions:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>For every two parts, their common space’s volume must
          be zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each part must contain exactly one chocolate chip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coordinates of the corners of all <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> parts must be integers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To prevent wasted food, candidates cannot throw away
          any part of the cake.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you divide the cake satisfying all the constraints and
      pass the first round of the Hunter Exam?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This year, <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9 + 7$</span>
    candidates participated in the first round of the Hunter Exam!
    Obviously, it is impossible for the Hunter Exam organizers, the
    Hunter Association, to manually check all the candidates’
    solutions. As the only programmer of the Hunter Association,
    you have been tasked with writing a program to automatically
    check whether the candidates’ solutions are valid.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains multiple test cases. Each test case is
    described as below:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le a, b, c \le 10^6, 1 \le m \le
        10^3)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
        lines, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line
        contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>
        positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_
        i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$z_ i$</span> — the
        coordinates of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th chocolate chip <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le x_ i \le a, 1 \le y_ i \le b, 1
        \le z_ i \le c)$</span>. No two chips are in the same
        position.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
        describe a solution given by a candidate:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le i \le m)$</span>
            contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$z_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_ i$</span> representing the
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th part
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le x_ i, u_ i, y_ i,
            v_ i, z_ i, w_ i \le 10^6)$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i, y_ i, z_ i)$</span> and
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$(u_ i, v_ i, w_
            i)$</span> are the coordinates of two opposite unit
            cubes of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th part.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Sum of <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> over all
    test cases in one input file is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \cdot 10^4$</span>.</p>
<p>The last line of the input contains a single number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print exactly one line, containing ‘YES’
    if the candidate’s solution satisfies all the given
    constraints:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th part
        must contains the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th chocolate chip.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Candidate did not throw away any part of the cake.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The volume of the intersection of any two parts must be
        equal to zero.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le x_ i \le u_ i \le
        a, 1 \le y_ i \le v_ i \le b, 1 \le z_ i \le w_ i \le
        c$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, print ‘NO’.</p>
<p>Note that it is <b class="bfseries">not</b> guaranteed that
    the cake can be divided into <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> parts satisfying all the given
    constraints. In which case, the output for that test case would
    be ‘NO’.</p>
