<p>The kindergarten teachers had finally managed to get all the
    kids in a line for the walk to the bus station and the weekly
    excursion. What they hadn’t thought of was the fact that today
    different kids were supposed to go to different excursions.
    They should walk as one line to the bus station, but to avoid
    total chaos when they arrive there, all the kids going to the
    zoo should be in the beginning of the line, the ones going to
    the lake should be in the middle and the rest, going to the
    science museum, should be in the end.</p>
<p>Since it takes a lot of time to get all the kids to stand in
    a line no kid may step out of the line. To get the line
    organized after excursion group, kids standing next to each
    other can swap places. Now the kindergarten teachers wonder, if
    they will have time to do this and still catch their bus.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>You will be given a sequence of numbers 0, 1, and 2,
    denoting the excursion destinations of each kid from first to
    last in the line. Pairs of adjacent kids can swap positions,
    and the line should be organized after destination number
    starting with 0 and ending with 2. What is the minimum number
    of swaps required to organize the line?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The only line of input contains a string consisting of
    characters 0, 1 or 2, denoting the destinations of kids. The
    length of the string will be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span> characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with one integer – the minimum number of
    swaps needed to get the kids in order.</p>
