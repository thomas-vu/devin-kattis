<p>Your task is to read a picture of a chessboard position and
    print it in the chess notation.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of an ASCII-art picture of a chessboard
    with chess pieces on positions described by the input. The
    pieces of the white player are shown in upper-case letters,
    while the black player’s pieces are lower-case letters. The
    letters are one of “<tt class="ttfamily">K</tt>” (King),
    “<tt class="ttfamily">Q</tt>” (Queen), “<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>” (Rook), “<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>”
    (Bishop), “<tt class="ttfamily">N</tt>” (Knight), or
    “<tt class="ttfamily">P</tt>” (Pawn). The chessboard outline is
    made of plus (“<tt class="ttfamily">+</tt>”), minus
    (“<tt class="ttfamily">-</tt>”), and pipe (“<tt class="ttfamily">|</tt>”) characters. The black fields are filled
    with colons (“<tt class="ttfamily">:</tt>”), white fields with
    dots (“<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>”).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output consists of two lines. The first line consists of
    the string “<tt class="ttfamily">White:</tt> ”, followed by the
    description of positions of the pieces of the white player. The
    second line consists of the string “<tt class="ttfamily">Black:</tt> ”, followed by the description of
    positions of the pieces of the black player.</p>
<p>The description of the position of the pieces is a
    comma-separated list of terms (without any spaces) describing
    the pieces of the appropriate player. The description of a
    piece consists of a single upper-case letter that denotes the
    type of the piece (except for pawns, for that this identifier
    is omitted). This letter is immediatelly followed by the
    position of the piece in the standard chess notation – a
    lower-case letter between “<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>” and
    “<tt class="ttfamily">h</tt>” that determines the column
    (“<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>” is the leftmost column in the
    input) and a single digit between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> that determines the row
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> is the first row in
    the input).</p>
<p>The pieces in the description must appear in the following
    order: Kings (“<tt class="ttfamily">K</tt>”), Queens
    (“<tt class="ttfamily">Q</tt>”), Rooks (“<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>”), Bishops (“<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>”),
    Knights (“<tt class="ttfamily">N</tt>”), and pawns.</p>
<p>Note that the numbers of pieces may differ from the initial
    position, and might not even correspond to a situation that
    could arise in a valid chess game.</p>
<p>In case two pieces of the same type appear in the input, the
    piece with the smaller row number must be described before the
    other one if the pieces are white, and the one with the larger
    row number must be described first if the pieces are black. If
    two pieces of the same type appear in the same row, the one
    with the smaller column letter must appear first.</p>
