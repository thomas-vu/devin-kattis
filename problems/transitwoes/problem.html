<p>Everyday Yraglac relies on his city’s local transit system
    to get to and from campus. Since this is routine for him, he’s
    memorized exactly what time will let him leave his house and
    make it in time to his first morning class. Of course transit
    being transit, they decided to change around the schedules for
    some of the routes Yraglac takes.</p>
<p>Yraglac leaves his house everyday at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> to make it to his first class
    which starts at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>.
    To get there, he takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    transit routes, one after the other. When transferring from one
    transit route to another, going from his house to the first
    transit stop, and going from the last transit stop to his
    class, he must walk for <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_
    i$</span> time. Yraglac rides the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i-th$</span> bus for <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> time before getting off and
    walking to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+1$</span>-th
    bus stop. Last but not least, each bus only comes at an
    interval of every <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span>.
    The first one always leaving at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<p>Given the new schedules for the routes Yraglac takes, can
    you find out if he can make it to class on time?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> space separated integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq s \leq t \leq 1\,
    000$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq
    20$</span>.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n +
    1$</span> space separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0 \leq d_ i \leq 1\, 000)$</span> denoting
    the time it takes to walk from the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th bus’ drop-off point to the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+1$</span>-th bus stop. Note
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_0$</span> is the time it
    takes to walk from Yraglac’s house to the first bus stop, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ n$</span> is the time it
    takes to walk from the last bus’ drop-off point to his
    class.</p>
<p>The third line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq b_ i \leq 1\, 000)$</span> denoting
    the amount of time Yraglac rides the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th bus.</p>
<p>The fourth line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq c_ i \leq 1\, 000)$</span> denoting
    the intervals the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    bus arrives.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “yes” if Yraglac will be able to get to class in
    time, and “no” otherwise.</p>
