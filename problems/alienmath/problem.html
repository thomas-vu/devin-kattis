<div class="problembody">
<p>Humans are exploring the stars, and we have encountered
    aliens! In an exchange of scientific knowledge, we’ve learned
    that not only do they use entirely different symbols to do
    math, they don’t even use base ten! It would be nice to have a
    program to convert the alien numbers to decimal.</p>
<p>Shockingly, the aliens represent each of their digits with
    what might be multiple ascii characters. For example,
    <tt class="ttfamily">aba</tt> might be a single digit for the
    alien’s numerical system.</p>
<p>Given the base of their number system, an ordered list of
    all their system’s digits, and a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, convert <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> to base <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> and print it without any leading
    zeros.</p>
<p>For a quick refresher on number systems, a number system
    with base <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> digits that represent
    the values <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> through
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B-1$</span>. For example, an
    alien number system with base <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> could have digits <tt class="ttfamily">zork</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">ooble</tt>, and
    <tt class="ttfamily">trzap</tt> representing the values
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> respectively. The alien number
    <tt class="ttfamily">trzapzorkooble</tt>, when written in
    standard decimal notation, is just <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \cdot 3^2 + 0 \cdot 3^1 + 1 \cdot 3^0 =
    19$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input will consist of a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq B \leq 10^3$</span>) indicating the
    number of digits used in the alien number system.</p>
<p>The next line consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> strings <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_0, D_1, \ldots , D_{B-1}$</span> with a
    single space between each string. These represent the digits in
    the alien number system, namely string <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ i$</span> is the digit with value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. Each digit string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ i$</span> will consist of at
    least one and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    characters and will only contain lowercase letters (i.e.
    <tt class="ttfamily">a</tt> through <tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>).</p>
<p>The third line contains a single string <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> consisting of at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$300$</span> characters. This
    string represents a number written in the alien number system.
    The value of this number, in decimal, is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>. It may be written with leading
    zeros in the alien number system. You are guaranteed that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is the concatenation
    of digits from the alien number system (i.e. it is a valid
    number in their system).</p>
<p>Oh, and this is important. The aliens knew their system was
    a bit complicated, so to make it easier to read, they designed
    their number system so that the strings representing distinct
    digits do not have one being a prefix of the other. That is,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ i$</span> is not a prefix of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ j$</span> for any indices
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i \neq j$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>
    in standard base <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    notation without any leading zeros.</p>
