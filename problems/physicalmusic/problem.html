<p>The music business is changing rapidly, and this is
    reflected by the single charts. Initially, the Dutch Single Top
    100 was based purely on sale numbers of CD singles. In the
    course of time, however, these numbers dropped dramatically, in
    favour of legal and illegal downloads of music from the
    internet. Therefore, since 2006, downloads of singles from
    specific legal downloads sites are incorporated into the chart.
    Nowadays, even streams from certain streaming platforms
    contribute to the Single Top 100.</p>
<p>Between 2006 and 2013, when the Single Top 100 was based on
    both CD singles and downloads, there was also a chart called
    the Download Top 100, based purely on the downloads. Assuming
    that both charts used the same numbers of weekly downloads, one
    could tell from a comparison between the two charts, which
    singles were selling well physically. And in fact, since some
    singles did not even appear as CD singles any more, one could
    tell which singles were <em>certainly</em> available as CD
    single: the ones that were doing better (as compared to some
    other singles) in the Single Top 100 than in the Download Top
    100.</p>
<p>Now, you are asked to write a program to determine these
    singles. To be prepared for other communities, which may also
    have single charts of other sizes, your program should not be
    limited to charts containing exactly one hundred singles.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 20$</span>), the number of
    test cases. Then for each test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 100\, 000$</span>, the
        size of both single charts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, each
        containing a single integer, which together form a
        permutation of the numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1,\ldots ,N$</span>. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_{i}$</span> is the position in the
        Download Top <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> of
        the single that is ranked <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> in the Single Top <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As the above specification implies, the Download Top
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and the Single Top
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> contain exactly the
    same <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> singles, possibly
    in different orders.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing the number of singles <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> that are certainly available
        as CD single.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines, each
        containing a single integer, the <em>positions</em> of the
        singles in the Download Top <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> that are certainly available
        as CD single, in ascending order.</p>
</li>
</ul>
