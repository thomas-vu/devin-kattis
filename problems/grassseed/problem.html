<div class="problembody">
<p>Many years ago after another unfruitful day in Cubicle Land,
    banging her head against yet another cutting edge, marketing
    buzzword-filled JavaScript framework, Janice the engineer
    looked out of the window and decided that time was ripe for a
    change.</p>
<p>So swapping her keyboard and mouse for a fork and a spade,
    she started her own gardening company.</p>
<p>After years of hard outdoor work Janice now has biceps like
    Van Damme and owns the premiere landscaping company in the
    whole of the South West, and has just been lucky enough to
    broker a large contract to sow lawns for landed gentry.</p>
<p>Each contract details the size of the lawns that need to be
    seeded, and the cost of seed per square metre. How much do you
    need to spend on seed?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing a real number <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; C \le 100$</span>), the cost of
        seed to sow one square metre of lawn.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; L \le 100$</span>), the number of
        lawns to sow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> lines, each
        containing two positive real numbers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le w_ i \le 100$</span>), the width
        of the lawn, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_
        i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le l_ i \le
        100$</span>), the length of the lawn.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All real numbers are given with at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> decimals after the decimal
    point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing a real number: the cost to sow all
        of the lawns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All output must be accurate to an absolute or relative error
    of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
