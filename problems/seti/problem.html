<p>For some years, quite a lot of work has been put into
    listening to electromagnetic radio signals received from space,
    in order to understand what civilizations in distant galaxies
    might be trying to tell us. One signal source that has been of
    particular interest to the scientists at <em>Université de
    Technologie Spatiale</em> is the Nebula Stupidicus.</p>
<p>Recently, it was discovered that if each message is assumed
    to be transmitted as a sequence of integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_0,a_1,...a_{n-1}$</span>, the function
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(k)=(\sum _{i=0}^{n-1}{a_ i k^
    i})\bmod {p}$</span> always evaluates to values <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le f(k) \le 26$</span> for <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le k \le n$</span>, provided that the
    correct value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is
    used. <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is of course the
    length of the transmitted message, and the integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> satisfy
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le a_ i &lt; p$</span>.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is a prime number that
    is guaranteed to be larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> as well as larger than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span>. It is, however,
    known to never exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$30\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<p>These relationships altogether have been considered too
    peculiar for being pure coincidences, so this calls for further
    investigation.</p>
<p>The linguists at the faculty of <em>Langues et Cultures
    Extraterrestres</em> transcribe these messages to strings in
    the English alphabet to make the messages easier to handle
    while trying to interpret their meanings. The transcription
    procedure simply assigns the letters <span class="tex2jax_process">$a \ldots z$</span> to the values
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \ldots 26$</span> that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(k)$</span> might evaluate to,
    such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1=a$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2=b$</span> etc. The value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> is transcribed to ‘*’
    (an asterisk). While transcribing messages, the linguists
    simply loop from <span class="tex2jax_process">$k=1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, and append the
    character corresponding to the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(k)$</span> at the end of the string.</p>
<p>The backward transcription procedure, has however, turned
    out to be too complex for the linguists to handle by
    themselves. You are therefore assigned the task of writing a
    program that converts strings created in this way back to the
    original number sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_0,
    \ldots , a_{n-1}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line of the input there is a single positive
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, telling the
    number of test cases to follow. Each case consists of one line
    containing the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> to use during the transcription of
    the string, followed by the actual string to be transcribed.
    The only allowed characters in the string are the lower case
    letters ‘a’-‘z’ and ’*’ (asterisk). No string will be longer
    than 70 characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each transcribed string, output a line with the
    corresponding list of integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_0, \dots , a_{n-1}$</span>, separated by
    space.</p>
