<p>Biologists have discovered a strange DNA molecule, best
    described as a sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> characters from the set
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ A, B\} $</span>. An unlikely
    sequence of mutations has resulted in a DNA strand consisting
    only of <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>â€™s. Biologists
    found that very odd, so they began studying the mutations in
    greater detail.</p>
<p>They discovered two types of mutations. One type results in
    changing any single character of the sequence (<span class="tex2jax_process">$A \rightarrow B$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$B \rightarrow A$</span>). The second type
    changes a whole <em>prefix</em> of the sequence, specifically
    replacing all characters in positions from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (for some <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, inclusive) with the other
    character (<span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>).</p>
<p>Compute the least possible number of mutations that could
    convert the starting molecule to its end state (containing only
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> characters). Mutations
    can occur in any order.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 1\, 000\, 000$</span>), the
    length of the molecule. The second line of input contains a
    string with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    characters, with each character being either <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. This string represents the
    starting state of the molecule.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the required
    minimum number of mutations.</p>
