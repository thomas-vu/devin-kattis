<p>Kattis the Cat enjoys clearing quests on her mobile game.
    Each quest has an energy consumption <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span>, and gold reward <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span>. However, as Kattis has become
    very busy lately with grading her student’s problem sets, she
    does not have much spare time as before to keep clearing
    quests. As such, she has adopted a new ‘greedy’ strategy to
    clear her quests in each session as quickly as possible. With
    energy <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> for a session,
    she will do the following:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Find the <b class="bfseries">largest</b> energy quest
        from the current pool of quest which is <b class="bfseries">smaller or equal</b> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, if tied, by the <b class="bfseries">largest</b> gold reward,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clear the quest, removing it from current pool. Reduce
        energy <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> by
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> of the quest, and
        add up the gold reward <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> earned this session.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat steps <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> with remaining
        amount of energy, until energy left becomes <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, or if there are no more
        quests to be cleared with remaining energy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>However, she is not sure if this strategy is optimal, and
    wants your help in determining how much she has earned in each
    playing session. Kattis the Cat will give a list of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> commands:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">add E G</b>: add <b class="bfseries">a copy</b> of the quest with energy consumption
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> and gold reward
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> into the pool,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">query X</b>: using the ‘greedy’
        quest clearing strategy described above, print out the
        total amount of gold Kattis the Cat earned in this session
        with energy <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 2\cdot 10^5$</span>) denoting the number of commands.
    Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contains a string S, denoting one of the above commands. For
    the <b class="bfseries">add</b> command, two integers will
    follow, <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le E, G \le 10^5$</span>), denoting the
    energy consumption and gold reward of the quest respectively.
    For the <b class="bfseries">query</b> command, one integer will
    follow, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le X \le 10^5$</span>), denoting the
    amount of energy Kattis the Cat has for this session.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each <b class="bfseries">query X</b> command, print the
    amount of gold Kattis the Cat earned for that session in a new
    line.</p>
