<p>Brandon is playing the newest idle game, Mouse Pursuit! The
    goal of this game is to pursue mice for cheese and glory.</p>
<p>In Mouse Pursuit, an <em>event</em> consists of pursuing a
    mouse. If the mouse is caught, the player might earn cheese and
    glory. However, if the mouse is not caught, the player might
    lose cheese and glory.</p>
<p>Given Brandonâ€™s recent events, Brandon wants to know how
    much cheese and glory he earned in the last <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> seconds.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le n \le 10^5)$</span>.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines take
    one of two forms:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>CAUGHT <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>: A mouse was caught exactly
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> seconds ago. The
        player gained <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>
        pieces of cheese and <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> units of glory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>MISS <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>: A mouse was missed exactly
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> seconds ago. The
        player lost <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> pieces
        of cheese and <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>
        units of glory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For all events, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le c, g
    \le 10^6$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le s \le
    10^9$</span>. It is guaranteed that no two events happened at
    exactly the same time.</p>
<p>The last line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>. It is guaranteed that no event
    happened exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    seconds ago.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two integers - the number of pieces of cheese Brandon
    gained in the last <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    seconds, and the number of units of glory Brandon gained in the
    last <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> seconds.</p>
