</div>Bob’s Bakery is celebrating its grand opening! To
    commemorate this exciting occasion, they are offering a
    “Bundles of Joy” sale to encourage people to sample their full
    range of delectable desserts.

    <p>For example, you can buy the “Chocolate Cakes” bundle which
    includes chocolate layer cake and black forest cake for $20. Or
    you can buy the “Fruity Cakes” bundle which includes lemon
    pound cake and key lime cake, also for $20. They offer an even
    bigger bundle that includes a slice of each of these cakes for
    an even lower price of $38.</p>
<p>You want to try out each dessert they offer. So, you need to
    buy some bundles to ensure you get at least one of each
    dessert. Of course, your goal is to do this while minimizing
    the amount of money you spend on bundles.</p>
<p>Finally, you make a few observations about the bundles they
    offer:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>For any two bundles <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, either every dessert in
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> is also in
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, every dessert in
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> is also in
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, or there is no
        dessert in both <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The only way to buy an item individually is if it is in
        a bundle of size 1. Not all items are in such a bundle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The pricing is not very well thought out. It may be
        cheaper to acquire items in a bundle <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> by buying some combination of
        other bundles rather than <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> itself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 50$</span> indicating the number of
    test cases. The first line of each test case contains two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of different types
    of desserts offered by Bob’s Bakery and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number of different
    bundles. Here, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq
    100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq
    150$</span>.</p>
<p>Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines follow,
    each describing a bundle. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th such line begins with two
    positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span>. Here,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; p_ i \leq 10^6$</span> is
    the price of bundle <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s_ i \leq n$</span>
    is the number of items in bundle <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. The rest of this line consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> distinct integers
    ranging from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, indicating what
    desserts are included in this bundle.</p>
<p>Each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> items
    will appear in at least one bundle.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output for each test case is a single line containing
    the minimum cost of purchasing bundles to ensure you get at
    least one of each item. This value is guaranteed to fit in a
    32-bit signed integer.</p>
