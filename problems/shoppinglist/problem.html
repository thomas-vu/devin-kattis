<p>Kelly, being the great programmer that she is, is frequently
    thinking of “the next big thing” for apps. One morning Kelly
    thought of the brilliant idea to create a social network for
    grocery shopping lists. Kelly wants to make her social network
    connect people that buy the same things from the grocery store
    so she needs your help coming up with a program to figure out
    when users are buying the same things at the grocery store so
    her site can run relevant ads. Kelly wants to compare a user’s
    latest shopping list to all of their previous shopping lists
    and find out which items they buy every time they go to the
    store.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input will contain two space separated
    integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100$</span>), the
    number of shopping lists, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le m \le 5\, 000$</span>), the number of items on each of
    those lists. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines is one of the shopping
    lists, containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    space-separated items each. Each item is less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span> characters long and made only of
    lowercase English characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    giving the number of items that are found on every list on the
    first line. On the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, print these items in
    alphabetical order, one item per line.</p>
