</div>“Eeny meeny miny moe” is a well-known nursery rhyme in
    English, used (among other things) by kids to “randomly” select
    members of a team. It exists in many variations, one of which
    goes like this:
    <blockquote class="quote">
      Eeny, meeny, miny, moe,<br/>
      Catch a tiger by the toe.<br/>
      If he hollers, let him go,<br/>
      Eeny, meeny, miny, moe.
    </blockquote>
<p>Similar verses exist in most languages, such as “Ulle dulle
    dof” in Finnish, “Akka bakka bonka rakka” in Norwegian, and
    “Ole dole doff” in Swedish.</p>
<p>Two teams are to be selected for a game and the rhyme is
    used to select one kid for a team at a time, alternating
    between the two teams, until all kids have been selected. The
    kids are standing in a circle. In each selection round we start
    counting the kids in clockwise order around the circle,
    skipping one kid for every word in the rhyme, until the last
    word. The kid matching the last word is chosen for the current
    team and then the next round starts. In all rounds but the
    first, the counting starts at the next remaining kid (in
    clockwise order) after the one that was selected in the
    previous round. See Figure 1 for an example.</p>
<p>Given such a rhyme, and a group of kids, can you tell which
    kids will be in which team?</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: Illustration of the first three rounds of
        Sample Input 1. In rounds 1 and 3, Alvar and Rakel get
        selected for the first team, and in round 2, Lisa is
        selected for the second team. In round 4 (not shown), only
        Kalle remains and is selected for the second team.

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the rhyme, consisting of a
    list of words separated by spaces. The second line of input
    contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100$</span>), the
    number of kids. Then follow the names of the kids, one per
    line. The kids are given in clockwise order and the first kid
    listed is the one at which counting starts in the first
    round.</p>
<p>All words and names consist only of upper and lower case
    letters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>’-‘<tt class="ttfamily">Z</tt>’ and ‘<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>’-‘<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>’. No input line
    is empty or longer than <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters (excluding the
    newline character at the end of the line).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the two teams, starting with the one whose first
    member is chosen first. For each team, output the number of
    kids in the team, followed by the names of the kids in the
    team, in the same order as they were chosen for the team.</p>
