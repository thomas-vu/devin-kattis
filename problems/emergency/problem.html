<p>Löpkass is out running in the forest again. He loves running
    in the forest. However, there is a programming competition
    starting in a couple of hours, and he needs to calculate how
    long it will take him to get home (so that he can stay in the
    fresh air as long as possible). You have to help him out.</p>
<p>The forest is modelled as a graph with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> nodes. Nodes are numbered
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0, 1, ..., n-1$</span>. Löpkass
    is located in node <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>,
    and his home is located in node <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. Two nodes <span class="tex2jax_process">$v,w$</span> are connected if <span class="tex2jax_process">$v+1 = w$</span>. Additionally, two nodes are
    connected if they are both a multiple of some integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>. In this problem, we
    do not consider <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to be
    a multiple of <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>One line with two integers, the number of nodes <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}$</span>, and the
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq K \leq
    10^{18}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single integer on a single line: the shortest path
    from node 0 to node <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>.</p>
