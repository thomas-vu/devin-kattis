<div class="problembody">
<p>Night clubs aren’t what they used to be. Our benevolent
    state has decided that, for health and safety reasons, every
    club must now meet a minimum lighting standard. They have moved
    to verify standards by dividing each club up into <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\text { m}^2$</span> cells and measuring
    the light levels on the floor with probes in the centre of each
    cell.</p>
<p>Club owners aren’t happy about this; they will comply with
    the letter of the law, but don’t want to spend a penny more
    than they have to on electricity. Instead of upgrading their
    lighting, they will fence off the offending parts of the club
    to deal with later.</p>
<p>You will be given a grid representing a map of the lights in
    a club. Each cell of the grid (<span class="tex2jax_process">$r, c$</span>) will have a light directly
    above its centre with a bulb of strength <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le s \le 9$</span>).</p>
<p>The ceiling is flat—its height is constant. Each light will
    affect every other cell, increasing the light level at distance
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y,z)$</span>
    by:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \frac{s}{x^2+y^2+z^2}
    \]</span>
<p>Building a section of transparent fencing between any two
    cells usually costs £11. However, if the cells on both sides
    meet the minimum lighting standard, the price per length of
    fencing rises steeply to £43, as builders find it hard to work
    under the pulsating night club lights and demand extra
    compensation.</p>
<p>Of course, building a fence along the outside of the
    clubbing area would not do, as that could block fire exits and
    cause a whole other kind of hazard.</p>
<p>How much will you have to spend on fencing out the dark
    spots?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; B \le 9$</span>), the minimum
        required light level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; H \le 5$</span>), the height of
        the ceiling in the club.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; R,C \le 30$</span>), the length
        and width of the club.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> further lines,
        each containing a string of <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> digits, representing the
        strength of lights at each cell of the club.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is guaranteed that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2(R+C)-4$</span> cells along the borders of
    the club are sufficiently lit.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing one integer: the total number of
        pounds that must be spent on fencing.</p>
</li>
