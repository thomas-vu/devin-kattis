<p>Tina is organizing Secret Santa at work. Secret Santa is a
    game where everyone is assigned to give a gift to another
    person, in secret. On the last day before Christmas, everyone
    opens their present.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony is organized in the following way: Tina
    picks a random person who gets to open their present. Then the
    person who gave that present gets to open theirs, and so on,
    until they get to a person who already opened theirs. At this
    point, Tina has to pick another random person, and continue the
    process from there.</p>
<p>Tina doesnâ€™t like picking a random person, so she very much
    prefers that everyone form one big cycle. You have been given
    the task to find out if this is the case, so she can mentally
    prepare for how many random people she has to pick.</p>
<p>To your great horror, you find out that a secret Grinch has
    messed with the process so that each person <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> has to give a present to a random
    person <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, instead of
    each person <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> receiving
    a present from a random person <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>. Specifically this means that some
    people might get no gifts, and some people might get multiple
    gifts.</p>
<p>This mistake obviously needs to be fixed. What is the
    smallest number of people that have to be assigned a new person
    to give a gift, so that everyone will get a gift, and Tina only
    has to pick one random person in the opening ceremony?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of people
    involved.<br/>
    The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    each consists of a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$G_ i$</span>, the id of the person they
    should give a gift to.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of people who have to be assigned a new
    person as their secret Santa target.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
