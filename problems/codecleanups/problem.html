</div>The management of the software company JunkCode has
    recently found, much to their surprise and disappointment, that
    productivity has gone down since they implemented their
    enhanced set of coding guidelines. The idea was that all
    developers should make sure that every code change they push to
    the master branch of their software repository strictly follows
    the coding guidelines. After all, one of the developers,
    Perikles, has been doing this since long before these
    regulations became effective so how hard could it be?
    <p>Rather than investing a lot of time figuring out why this
    degradation in productivity occurred, the line manager suggests
    that they loosen their requirement: developers can push code
    that weakly violates the guidelines as long as they run cleanup
    phases on the code from time to time to make sure the
    repository is tidy.</p>
<p>She suggests a metric where the “dirtiness” of a developer’s
    code is the sum of the pushes that violate the guidelines –
    so-called <em>dirty</em> pushes – made by that developer, each
    weighted by the number of days since it was pushed. The number
    of days since a dirty push is a step function that increases by
    one each midnight following the push. Hence, if a developer has
    made dirty pushes on days <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, the dirtiness on day <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$5+4+1=10$</span>. She suggests that a
    cleanup phase, completely fixing all violations of the coding
    guidelines, must be completed before the dirtiness reaches
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>. One of the
    developers, Petra, senses that this rule must be obeyed not
    only because it is a company policy. Breaking it will also
    result in awkward meetings with a lot of concerned managers who
    all want to know why she cannot be more like Perikles? Still,
    she wants to run the cleanup phase as seldomly as possible, and
    always postpones it until it is absolutely necessary. A cleanup
    phase is always run at the end of the day and fixes every dirty
    push done up to and including that day. Since all developers
    are shuffled to new projects at the start of each year, no
    dirtiness should be left after midnight at the end of new
    year’s eve.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 365$</span>), the number of dirty pushes made by
    Petra during a year. The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_1, d_2, \ldots , d_ n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d_ i \leq 365$</span>
    for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i \le n$</span>)
    giving the days when Petra made dirty pushes. You can assume
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i &lt; d_ j$</span> for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i &lt; j$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the total number of cleanup phases needed for Petra
    to keep the dirtiness strictly below <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> at all times.</p>
