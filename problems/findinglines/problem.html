<div class="problembody">
<p>Annabel and Richard like to invent new games and play
    against each other. One day Annabel has a new game for Richard.
    In this game there is a game master and a player. The game
    master draws <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> points on
    a piece of paper. The task for the player is to find a straight
    line, such that at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> percent of the points lie exactly
    on that line. Richard and Annabel have very good tools for
    measurement and drawing. Therefore they can check whether a
    point lies exactly on a line or not. If the player can find
    such a line then the player wins. Otherwise the game master
    wins the game.</p>
<p>There is just one problem. The game master can draw the
    points in a way such that it is not possible at all to draw a
    suitable line. They need an independent mechanism to check
    whether there even exists a line containing at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> percent of the points,
    i.e., <span class="tex2jax_process">$\left\lceil n\cdot p/100
    \right\rceil $</span> points. Now it is up to you to help them
    and write a program to solve this task.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le n\le 10^5$</span>), the number of
        points the game master has drawn;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$20\le p \le 100$</span>), the percentage
        of points which need to lie on the line;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each with
        two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le x,y\le 10^9$</span>), the
        coordinates of a point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>No two points will coincide.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing either “<tt class="ttfamily">possible</tt>” if it is possible to find a suitable
    line or “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>” otherwise.</p>
