<div class="problembody">
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several test cases. Each test case
    starts with a line with three non-negative integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 150$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le m \le 5000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le q \le 1000$</span>,
    separated by single single spaces, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the numbers of nodes in the
    graph, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> the number of
    edges and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> the number
    of queries. Nodes are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each line consisting of
    three (space-separated) integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> indicating that there is an edge
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> in the graph with weight
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1000 \le w \le 1000$</span>.
    Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines of
    queries, each consisting of two node numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (separated by a space), asking for
    the minimum distance from node <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> to node <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>.</p>
<p>Input will be terminated by a line containing <tt class="ttfamily">0 0 0</tt>, this line should <em>not</em> be
    processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query, output a single line containing the minimum
    distance from node <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>, or the word
    <tt class="ttfamily">Impossible</tt> if there is no path from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>, or <tt class="ttfamily">-Infinity</tt> if there are arbitrarily short paths
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>. Print a blank line after each
    test case.</p>
