<div class="problembody">
<p>You are playing hide-and-go-seek in a forest with Belle. The
    forest has one tree at each of the positive integer lattice
    points. That is, there is a tree at every point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> are both positive integers. You
    may consider each tree as a point. A logging company has cut
    down all of the trees in some axis-aligned rectangle, including
    those on the boundary of the rectangle.</p>
<p>You are standing at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span> and Belle is standing at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ b,y_ b)$</span>. You can see
    Belle if and only if there is no tree blocking your line of
    sight to Belle. If there is a tree at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ b,y_ b)$</span>, Belle will make it
    easier for you to find her by standing on the side of the tree
    facing your location.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that Belle is standing at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2,6)$</span>. If the trees in the rectangle
    with corners at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,1)$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(5,4)$</span> are cut down
    (blue rectangle in figure), then you can see Belle. However, if
    the rectangle was at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3,5)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(5,7)$</span> (red rectangle in figure),
    then the tree at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,3)$</span>
    would be in the way.</p>

<p>Given the rectangle and Belle’s location, can you see
    her?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x_ b,y_ b \leq 10^{12}$</span>),
    which are the coordinates that Belle is standing on.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq 10^{12}$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq y_1 \leq y_2 \leq
    10^{12}$</span>), which specify two opposite corners of the
    rectangle at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1)$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2, y_2)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If you can see Belle, display <tt class="ttfamily">Yes</tt>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, display <tt class="ttfamily">No</tt> and the
    coordinates of the closest tree that is blocking your view.</p>
