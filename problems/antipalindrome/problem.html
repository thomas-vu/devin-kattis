</div>A palindrome is a sequence of two or more characters that
    reads the same both forward and backward. Palindromes can
    appear inside a longer text, such as “Happy days are here
    again.” in which “pp”, “ehe” and “ere” are some of the
    palindromes (ignoring spaces, punctuation, and case). An
    anti-palindrome is a sequence of two or more characters in
    which there are no palindromes. You are given text that may
    contain, or itself form, a palindrome. Your task is to
    determine if there are any palindromes in the text, in which
    case declare "Palindrome", or if there are none, declare
    "Anti-palindrome". The text may contain spaces, as well as
    alphabetic and other non-alphabetic characters. All
    non-alphabetic characters should be ignored, and uppercase and
    lowercase letters are considered the same when detecting
    palindromes.
    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one line of text as specified above.
    The input line will not be longer than 80 characters, and
    contains at least one alphabetic character.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print “Palindrome" if the text contains or is itself a
    palindrome, or “Anti-palindrome" if there are no palindromes in
    the text.</p>
