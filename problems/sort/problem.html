<div class="problembody">
<p>Mirko is a great code breaker. He knows any cipher in the
    world can be broken by frequency analysis. He has completely
    the wrong idea what frequency analysis is, however.</p>
<p>He intercepted an enemy message. The message consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> numbers, smaller than
    or equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>. Mirko
    belives freqency analysis consists of sorting this sequence so
    that more frequent numbers appear before less frequent
    ones.</p>
<p>Formally, the sequence must be sorted so that given any two
    numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> appears before <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> if the number of times
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> appears in the
    original sequence is larger than the number of time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> does. If the number of
    appearances is equal, the number whose <em>value</em> appears
    sooner in the input should appear sooner in the sorted
    sequence.</p>
<p>Help Mirko by creating a “frequency sorter”.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>First line of input contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 1\, 000$</span>), the length of the message, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le C \le 1\, 000\, 000\, 000$</span>),
    the number from the task description above.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> positive integers smaller than or
    equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, the message
    itself.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output should contain
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> numbers, the sorted
    sequence.</p>
