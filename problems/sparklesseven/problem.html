<p>In the wake of King Sombra’s siege on Equestria, Princess
    Celestia and Princess Luna have solicited the help of Shining
    Armor—Twilight Sparkle’s older brother—to ramp up the defenses
    of Canterlot Castle. Now, they have asked of Twilight to
    assemble a squad and try to break into the castle, hopefully
    exposing any security flaws it might have in the process.</p>

<p>The sibling rivalry between Twilight and Shining Armor is
    obviously well-known, and Twilight could not resist the
    opportunity to once again one-up her brother.</p>
<p>Twilight quickly assembled her heist squad, consisting of
    herself, Applejack, Rarity, Pinkie Pie, Fluttershy, Rainbow
    Dash and Spike, and sketched out a scheme to break into the
    castle.</p>
<p>They have identified <i class="itshape">seven</i> potential
    points of weakness in the defenses of Canterlot Castle. To
    complete the heist successfully, they need to exploit <i class="itshape">all</i> seven points of weakness. Unfortunately, not
    all points of weakness can be exploited by every member of the
    squad; for example, it may be the case that only Rarity can
    construct costumes intricate enough to fool the royal guards,
    and only Rainbow Dash can fly fast enough to defeat the system
    of giant fans that have been installed.</p>
<p>Twilight has noted for every member of the squad whether or
    not that member can exploit each of the seven points of
    weakness.</p>
<p>In one operation, Twilight must choose some non-empty subset
    of the members of the squad (possibly everyone) and have each
    chosen member exploit one weakness. It might not be possible to
    exploit all seven points of weakness in just one operation, so
    she can construct multiple such operations, possibly sending
    the same member on multiple operations. After all operations
    have been conducted, every weakness must have been exploited
    exactly once.</p>
<p>Of course, the more operations she needs to execute, the
    longer the heist will take and the greater the chance her
    conspiracy will be discovered; therefore, the number of
    operations should be as small as possible.</p>
<p>Can you help her plan out the heist?</p>
<p>If it is not possible for the heist to succeed at all, you
    should also let her know.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There will be seven lines of input.</p>
<p>Each line contains seven integers. In particular, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^\text {th}$</span> integer on
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span> of
    these lines is either:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, if the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span> member
        cannot exploit the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^\text
        {th}$</span> weakness;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, if the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span> member
        can exploit the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^\text
        {th}$</span> weakness.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The members are, in order, <tt class="ttfamily">Twilight
    Sparkle</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Applejack</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Rarity</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Pinkie Pie</tt>,
    <tt class="ttfamily">Fluttershy</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Rainbow Dash</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">Spike</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is not possible for the heist to succeed, output a
    single line containing the string <tt class="ttfamily">IMPOSSIBLE</tt>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, on the first line, output a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p \leq 7$</span>), the minimum number
    of operations needed to complete the heist successfully.</p>
<p>Then, output the <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>
    operations.</p>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span>
    operation should first contain a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m_ i \leq 7$</span>) on a single
    line, the number of members involved in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span> operation.</p>
<p>Then, on the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_
    i$</span> lines, output the members involved in the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span> plan. In
    particular, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^\text
    {th}$</span> of these lines should contain one of <tt class="ttfamily">Twilight Sparkle</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Applejack</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Rarity</tt>,
    <tt class="ttfamily">Pinkie Pie</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Fluttershy</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Rainbow
    Dash</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">Spike</tt> followed by a
    single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_{i, j}$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq e_{i, j} \leq
    7$</span>), separated by a space, denoting that the given
    member should exploit the <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_{i,
    j}^\text {th}$</span> point of weakness.</p>
<p>Each member should appear at most once in one operation, and
    every weakness should be exploited exactly once across all the
    operations. Within each operation, you can output the members
    in any order.</p>
<p>If there are multiple correct answers, you can output any of
    them.</p>
