<div class="problembody">
<p>You are sharing a large, circular pizza with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> of your friends. Your technique
    for slicing the pizza is shown in Figure 1; you rotate the
    pizza clockwise about its center by angle <span class="tex2jax_process">$\theta $</span>, and then you make a slice
    from the center of the pizza straight to the right. You repeat
    this process, rotating by the same angle <span class="tex2jax_process">$\theta $</span> and slicing to the right
    until you have done it a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> times.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: Rotate-and-slice pizza division technique.

</div>
<p>Of course, this isn’t really a good way to divide a pizza
    (unless <span class="tex2jax_process">$\theta $</span> is
    well-chosen). Some of the resulting slices may be larger than
    others, and you may not even end up with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> different slices. You don’t care
    so much about fairness. You just want to know how big the
    largest slice will be, so you can take it for yourself.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 200$</span> indicating the
    number of test cases that follow. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each contain one test case.
    Each test case gives the pizza radius in centimeters,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, followed by the
    number of people sharing the pizza, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, followed by the rotation angle,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\theta $</span>. The quantities
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\theta $</span> are all positive. The value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is an integer no
    greater than 100, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    is an integer no greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^8$</span>. The angle <span class="tex2jax_process">$\theta $</span> is given as an integer
    number of degrees, followed by an integer number of minutes and
    an integer number of seconds. Degrees are between 0 and 359
    (inclusive), while minutes and seconds are between 0 and 59
    (inclusive).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print the area in square centimeters of
    the largest resulting slice of pizza. You do not need to worry
    about the precise formatting of the answer (e.g. number of
    places past the decimal), but the absolute error of your output
    must be smaller than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span>.</p>
