<p>A number of students are members of a club that travels
    annually to exotic locations. Their destinations in the past
    have included Indianapolis, Phoenix, Nashville, Philadelphia,
    San Jose, and Atlanta. This spring they are planning a trip to
    Eindhoven.</p>
<p>The group agrees in advance to share expenses equally, but
    it is not practical to have them share every expense as it
    occurs. So individuals in the group pay for particular things,
    like meals, hotels, taxi rides, plane tickets, etc. After the
    trip, each student’s expenses are tallied and money is
    exchanged so that the net cost to each is the same, to within
    one cent. In the past, this money exchange has been tedious and
    time consuming. Your job is to compute, from a list of
    expenses, the minimum amount of money that must change hands in
    order to equalize (within a cent) all the students’ costs.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Standard input will contain the information for several
    trips (at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>). The
    information for each trip consists of a line containing a
    positive integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the
    number of students on the trip, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines of input, each containing
    the amount, in dollars and cents (i.e., with exactly two digits
    after the decimal point), spent by a student. There are no more
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span> students and
    no student spent more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$\$
    10\, 000.00$</span>. A single line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> follows the information for the
    last trip.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each trip, output a line stating the total amount of
    money, in dollars and cents, that must be exchanged to equalize
    the students’ costs.</p>
