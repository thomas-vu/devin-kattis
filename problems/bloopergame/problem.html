<p>Mario is competing in the most important elimination game of
    his entire life. He has been given a dalgona cookie, which is a
    cookie made out of caramelized sugar, that has a shape with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> sides etched into its
    surface. He also have a sewing needle that he is using to cut
    out the shape that is on the cookie. It sounds easy enough but
    if he messes up any of the edges and breaks the cookie, he will
    be inked by a Blooper and eliminated. As it currently stands,
    if he tries to cut an edge of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> from the shape, he has a
    probability of <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{1}{s}$</span> of succeeding at the
    cut. The chances of him successfully cutting every edge, and
    thus cutting out the shape from the cookie, is quite slim so he
    devises a strategy to succeed. At any point in time, he can
    lick a single edge of the shape, and by licking away some of
    the sugar, this raises the probability of cutting <b class="bfseries">that</b> edge to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>-th power <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0 &lt; P &lt; 1)$</span>, thus improving
    his chances at avoiding the icky inkage. Mario can also lick
    the same edge multiple times if he thinks that will be optimal,
    in which case the probability of cutting that edge is raised to
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>-th power for every
    lick. However, time is running out so he can only lick
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> times before time runs
    out. What is the maximum probability of avoiding the icky
    inkage after time runs out?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3
    \leq N \leq 100\, 000)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0
    \leq L \leq 10^9)$</span> and a real number <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0
    &lt; P &lt; 1)$</span>, representing the number of sides of the
    shape that is etched into the cookie, the number of licks Mario
    can make before time runs out, and the power that each sideâ€™s
    probability is raised to after a lick respectively.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> will contain at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> digits after the
    decimal point.<br/>
    Another <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines follow
    with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_
    i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq s_ i \leq
    10^9)$</span> representing a side length of the cookie. Note
    that the sides are not necessarily straight, so these side
    lengths may not necessarily follow the triangle inequality.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing a single real number <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> equal to the maximum probability
    of avoiding getting inked, assuming he uses his licks wisely.
    Your answer should not exceed an absolute or relative error of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
