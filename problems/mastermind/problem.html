<div class="problembody">
<p>Mastermind is a two-person code breaking game which works as
    follows. The first person (the <em>code maker</em>) creates a
    sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> colored
    pegs (with duplicate colors allowed) and hides it from view.
    This sequence of pegs is the <em>code</em>.</p>
<p>The second person (the <em>code breaker</em>) has the job of
    trying to determine the code maker’s code and she does so by
    making a series of guesses. Each guess also consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> colored pegs. After
    each guess, the code maker gives the code breaker feedback
    about how close she is. This feedback consists of two number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, where</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$r =$</span> the number of
        pegs that are identical in both color and position in the
        code and the guess, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$s =$</span> the number of
        remaining pegs that are identical in color but not in the
        same position.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, if the code is BACC (where we use different
    letters to represent colors) and the guess is CABB, then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r=1$</span> (the A in the second
    position of both the code and the guess) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s=2$</span> (a B and C in the remaining
    three characters). Note that only one of the B’s in the guess
    will “match” with the single B in the code: once pegs in the
    code and the guess have been “matched” with each other, they
    can’t be matched with any other pegs.</p>
<p>Your job in this problem is to determine <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> given a code and a guess.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a single line containing a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \leq 50$</span> (the length of
    the code) followed by two strings of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> — the first of these is the code
    and the second is the guess. Both code and guess are made up of
    upper-case alphabetic characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> for the given input.</p>
