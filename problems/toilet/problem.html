<p>Many potential conflicts lurk in the workplace and one of
    the most sensitive issues involves toilet seats. Should you
    leave the seat “up” or “down”? This also affects productivity,
    particularly at large companies. Hours each week are lost when
    employees need to adjust toilet seats. Your task is to analyze
    the impact different bathroom policies will have on the number
    of seat adjustments required.</p>
<p>The classical assumption is that a male usually uses a
    toilet with the seat “up” whereas a female usually uses it with
    the seat “down”. However, we will divide the population into
    those who prefer the seat up and those who prefer it down,
    regardless of gender.</p>
<p>Now, there are several possible policies that one could use,
    here are a few:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>When you leave, always leave the seat up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you leave, always leave the seat down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When you leave, always leave the seat as you would like
        to find it</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, a person may have to adjust the seat prior to using the
    toilet and, depending on policy, may need to adjust it before
    leaving.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Your task is to evaluate these different policies. For a
    given sequence of people’s preferences, you are supposed to
    calculate how many seat adjustments are made for each
    policy.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains a string of
    characters ’<tt class="tt">U</tt>’ and ’<tt class="tt">D</tt>’,
    indicating that a person in the sequence wants the seat
    <em>up</em> or <em>down</em>. The string has length at least 2
    and at most 1000.</p>
<p>The first character indicates the initial position of the
    toilet seat, and the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> characters indicate how a
    sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> people
    prefer the seat. You should compute the total number of seat
    adjustments needed for each of the three policies described
    above.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output three numbers, each on a separate line, the total
    number of seat adjustments for each policy.</p>
