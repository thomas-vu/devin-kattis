<p>One of Atrebla’s favourite pastimes is collecting stickers
    from all the conferences he attends. Due to a series of
    unfortunate events, all of the usual ones have been cancelled,
    so this year he has finally decided to start putting them onto
    his laptop.</p>
<p>Atrebla has laid out all of his stickers, decided where he
    would like to place them and in what order they should be
    placed. Before he starts sticking, he would like to make one
    final check to make sure he will be satisfied with the final
    result.</p>
<p>The surface of his laptop lid can be represented by a grid
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> rows and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> columns. Each
    character in the grid is either a ’_’, or a lowercase letter
    denoting a sticker. The first sticker is denoted with ’a’s, the
    second with ’b’s, and so on. When placed, a sticker will cover
    up everything beneath it. Any parts of a sticker that hangs off
    the laptop will be cut off.</p>
<p>Can you write a program to give a preview of what Atrebla’s
    laptop will look like after placing all of his stickers?</p>
<h2>Inputs</h2>
<p>The first line contains three space separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; L, H \leq 50$</span>, the
    length and height of the laptop lid, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq K \leq 26$</span> the number of
    stickers to be placed.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> lines contains four space
    separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; l \leq
    L$</span>, the length of the sticker, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; h \leq H$</span>, the height of the
    sticker, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a &lt;
    L$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq b &lt;
    H$</span> denoting the column and row of the top left corner of
    the sticker respectively.</p>
<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>Output the final state of the laptop lid after all the
    stickers have been placed.</p>
