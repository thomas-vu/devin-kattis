<p>A “Magic Bean” is a combination fidget toy and puzzle, with
    30 colored beads moving in three circular tracks. In its solved
    state, the upper circle contains ten indistinguishable orange
    beads, the lower left circle contains ten indistinguishable
    grey beads, and the lower right circle contains ten
    indistinguishable red beads. The beads can be rotated in each
    circle. In addition, there is a fourth circle in the middle
    that can be rotated, and in doing so exchanges consecutive
    triples of beads among the circles.</p>
<p>Your brother just borrowed your Magic Bean and arbitrarily
    rotated those circles, scrambling the beads. Your job is to
    solve the puzzle, by finding a sequence of valid rotations of
    the four circles that leads back to the solved state. You need
    not find the shortest such solution, but your solution should
    use no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$240$</span>
    moves. The provided input will be the state of the puzzle after
    applying some sequence of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$240$</span> moves.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of exactly three lines. Each line contains a
    string of length ten, consisting only of the characters
    <tt class="ttfamily">o</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">g</tt> and
    <tt class="ttfamily">r</tt>. The first line describes the ten
    beads in the top circle, the second describes the lower-left
    circle, and the third describes the lower-right circle.</p>
<p>The character <tt class="ttfamily">o</tt> designates an
    orange bead, <tt class="ttfamily">g</tt> a gray bead, and
    <tt class="ttfamily">r</tt> a red bead. The beads are listed in
    clockwise order, numbered according to the diagram.</p>
<p>The input configuration is the result of applying at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$240$</span> moves on a solved
    puzzle.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le k\le 240$</span>, which is the number
    of moves you needed to solve the puzzle.</p>
<p>Next, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$k&gt;0$</span>,
    output the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> moves on
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines, with one move
    per line, in order. Each move consists of a single character,
    specifying the circle to be rotated, followed immediately by a
    single digit specifying how far to rotate the circle in a
    clockwise direction. The top circle is specified with
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">o</tt>’, the lower left circle with
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">g</tt>’, the lower right circle with
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">r</tt>’, and the center circle with
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">c</tt>’. For the first three circles, the
    digit specifying the rotation has a value from 1 to 9; for the
    central circle, it has a value from 1 to 2.</p>
<p>The following two images show the input positions for the
    two samples.</p>
