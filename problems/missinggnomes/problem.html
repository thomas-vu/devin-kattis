<div class="problembody">
<p>A family of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> gnomes
    likes to line up for a group picture. Each gnome can be
    uniquely identified by a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1..n$</span> written on their hat.</p>
<p>Suppose there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>
    gnomes. The gnomes could line up like so: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 3, 4, 2, 5$</span>.</p>
<p>Now, an evil magician will remove some of the gnomes from
    the lineup and wipe your memory of the order of the gnomes. The
    result is a subsequence, perhaps like so: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 4, 2$</span>.</p>
<p>He then tells you that if you ordered all permutations of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1..n$</span> in lexicographical
    order, the original sequence of gnomes is the first such
    permutation which contains the remaining subsequence. Your task
    is to find the original sequence of gnomes.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that
    your program may be run multiple times on different inputs.
    Each test case will begin with a line with two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and then <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le m \le n \le 10^5$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of gnomes
    originally, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the
    number of gnomes remaining after the evil magician pulls his
    trick. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines will contain a single
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le g \le n$</span>). These are the
    remaining gnomes, in order. The values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> are guaranteed to be unique.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
    containing a single integer, representing the first permutation
    of gnomes that could contain the remaining gnomes in order.</p>
