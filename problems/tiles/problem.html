</div>Youssef is a Moroccan tile installer who specializes in
    mosaics like the one shown on the right. He has rectangular
    tiles of many dimensions at his disposal, and the dimensions of
    all his tiles are integer numbers of centimeters. When Youssef
    needs parallelogram-shaped tiles, he cuts them from his supply
    on hand. To make this work easier, he invented a tile cutting
    machine that superimposes a centimeter grid on the cutting
    surface to guide the cuts on the tiles. Due to machine
    limitations, aesthetic sensibilities, and Youssefâ€™s dislike of
    wasted tiles, the following rules determine the possible cuts.

    <ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>The rectangular tile to be cut must be positioned in the
        bottom left corner of the cutting surface and the edges
        must be aligned with the grid lines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The cutting blade can cut along any line connecting two
        different grid points on the tile boundary as long as the
        points are on adjacent boundary edges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The four corners of the resulting parallelogram tile
        must lie on the four sides of the original rectangular
        tile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No edge of the parallelogram tile can lie along an edge
        of the rectangular tile.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Figure 1 shows the eight different ways in which a
    parallelogram tile of area <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> square centimeters can be cut out
    of a rectangular tile, subject to these restrictions.</p>

<p>Youssef needs to cut tiles of every area between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{\text {lo}}$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{\text {hi}}$</span>. Now he
    wonders, for which area <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> in this range can he cut the
    maximum number of different tiles?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of
    input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 500$</span>), the number of test cases. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{\text {lo}},
    a_{\text {hi}}$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le
    a_{\text {lo}} \le a_{\text {hi}} \le 500\, 000$</span>), the
    range of areas of the tiles.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{\text
    {lo}}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{\text
    {hi}}$</span>, display the value <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> between <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{\text {lo}}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{\text {hi}}$</span> such that the number
    of possible ways to cut a parallelogram of area <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is maximized as well as the number
    of different ways <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> in
    which such a parallelogram can be cut. If there are multiple
    possible values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
    display the smallest one.</p>
