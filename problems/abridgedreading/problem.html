<p>Miss Othmar is a grade school teacher who uses a very
    interesting textbook in her science class. All of the chapters
    in the book have material that depends on at most one previous
    chapter’s material, while several chapters are labeled
    “Culminating Concept” chapters that have no chapters depending
    on them –– they basically represent the culmination of the
    stream of material in all the previous chapters that must be
    read before them. Chapters that are not Culminating Concept
    chapters are referred to as “prerequisite chapters.”</p>
<p>Because of various delays caused by the pandemic, Miss
    Othmar is far behind where she wants to be in the class. It’s
    too late to try to cover all of the Culminating Concept
    chapters in the book (and their required prerequisite chapters)
    so she has decided to cover just two more Culminating Concept
    chapters. To give the kids a break she has decided to pick the
    two Culminating Concept chapters which require the least amount
    of reading –– this would include not only those chapters but
    their prerequisite chapters as well.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span>) indicates the number of chapters
    (numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq m &lt; n$</span>) indicates the number of chapter
    dependencies. After this are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> positive values indicating the
    number of pages in each chapter. These values will be on one or
    more lines and the number of pages in any chapter is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$ \leq 1\, 000$</span>. After
    this are <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each
    containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq a &lt; b \leq n)$</span> indicating that chapter
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> must be read before
    chapter <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. No chapter
    appears as the second integer in these lines more than once.
    There will be at least two Culminating Concept chapters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum number of pages that need to be read in
    order to complete two Culminating Concept chapters.</p>
