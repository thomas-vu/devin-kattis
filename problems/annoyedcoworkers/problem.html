        A picture of you, not working. Source: <a href="https://xkcd.com/303/">XKCD 303</a>

</div>
<p>It’s another day in the office, and you’re a mastermind of
    not doing any work yourself. Instead, you’ll go to your
    coworkers for “help,” but secretly have them do all the
    work.</p>
<p>You’ve determined that the more one of your coworkers helps
    you, the more annoyed they become. You’ve also been able to
    determine how much more annoyed a coworker gets everytime you
    ask them for help. At the beginning of the day, a coworker is
    initially <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> annoyed at
    you. That’s their annoyance level. Everytime you ask them for
    help though, they become <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> more annoyed at you – their
    annoyance level <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
    increases by a constant amount <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> so that <span class="tex2jax_process">$a=a+d$</span>.</p>
<p>You want to complete a project of <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> tasks solely with “help” from your
    coworkers, but you need to be careful not to annoy any of them
    too much.</p>
<p>What’s the best you can do?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le h \le 100\, 000$</span>) is the number of times you have to
    ask for help to complete the project, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le c \le 100\, 000$</span>) denotes the number of coworkers
    you have.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> lines contains two positive
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, representing a
    coworker whose initial annoyance level is <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and who is getting more annoyed at
    you by an increase of <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>
    every time you ask them for help (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le a, d \le 10^9$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single number, which is the maximum annoyance level
    <i class="itshape">any</i> coworker has at you provided you use
    an optimal strategy to minimize this level. (In other words, of
    all possible strategies, choose one that minimizes the
    annoyance level of the worker or workers who are most annoyed
    at you at the end.)</p>
<h2>Sample Input 1 Explanation</h2>
<p>You have <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> coworkers
    and you need to ask for help <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> times. Initially, their annoyance
    levels are <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1=1, a_2=2, a_3=3,
    a_4=4$</span>, the increases are <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_1=2, d_2=3, d_3=4, d_4=5$</span>. One
    optimal solution is to ask for help twice from coworker
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, once from coworker
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and once from
    coworker <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, in which
    case the final annoyance levels are: <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1=1 + 2 \cdot 2 = 5, a_2=2 + 3 = 5, a_3=3
    + 4 = 7, a_4=4$</span>. The coworker that is most annoyed at
    you is coworker <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, whose
    annoyance level at you is <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>. Or, you could ask coworker
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> for help <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> times and coworker <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> once, leaving you with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1=1 + 3 \cdot 2 = 7, a_2=2 + 3
    = 5, a_3=3, a_4=4$</span>. Both strategies yield the same
    minimal maximum amount.</p>
