<p>Jacquez and Alia’s parents take them on many road trips. To
    keep themselves occupied, they play a triangular peg game,
    meant for one player. In the original game, one player has an
    equilateral triangle containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> holes (five holes per side of the
    triangle). Initially one hole is empty and the remaining
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span> are filled with pegs.
    The player moves by picking up a peg to “jump” it over an
    adjacent peg, landing on an empty hole adjacent to the jumped
    peg. Jumps must be in straight lines (horizontally or
    diagonally). The peg that is jumped over is removed. The goal
    of this game is to leave just one peg on the board. Figure 1
    shows the result of a jump in this game.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: One possible move in the original game. On
        the left is an initial board, where <tt class="ttfamily">X</tt> represents a peg and <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt> represents an empty hole. The jump moves
        the right peg in the second (from top) row diagonally down
        and to the left, over the middle peg of the third row,
        which is removed.

<p>Ultimately, Jacquez and Alia have gotten bored of playing
    this game individually. They decide to invent a version that
    they could play together. In the new version, each peg has a
    positive point value, and they alternate turns. During a
    player’s turn, they must make a jump if one is available. The
    score for a jump is the product of the two pegs involved in the
    jump.</p>
<p>The total score of a player is the sum of the scores of
    their jumps. The game ends when a player has no possible jumps
    to make. Each player’s goal is to maximize their own total
    score minus their opponent’s total score (at the end of the
    game). For example, Jacquez would prefer to win with a score of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> to Alia’s score of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span> (with a differential
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span>), than to win with
    a score of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> to
    Alia’s score of <span class="tex2jax_process">$998$</span>
    (with a smaller differential of only <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>). Similarly, Alia wants to win by
    as much as possible over Jacquez.</p>
<p>For this version of the game, we can display the game state
    by replacing each <tt class="ttfamily">X</tt> shown above with
    a corresponding value for that peg, and using a value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> (zero) for each of the
    open holes. Figure 2 shows an example move.</p>

<b>Figure 2</b>: One possible move in the new game, jumping
        the peg with value <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>
        over the peg with value <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>. This move is worth
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$6\cdot 7 = 42$</span> for
        Jacquez (since he moves first). The values are from the
        first sample input.

<p>Jacquez has had some trouble winning. Write a program to
    calculate the best he can do, assuming that he starts and both
    players play optimally.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of five lines, describing the initial
    state of the board. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le i \le 5)$</span> line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> space separated
    integers, representing the pegs and holes on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> row. Each of these
    integers is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, inclusive. A
    value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> represents a
    hole while the rest of the values represent pegs. It is
    possible for two different pegs to have the same value. Of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> input values it is
    guaranteed that exactly one is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, thus all input boards start with
    exactly one hole.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the value of Jacquez’s score minus Alia’s score at
    the end of the game, assuming Jacquez starts and both players
    play optimally.</p>
