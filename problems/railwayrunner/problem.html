<div class="problembody">
<p>Mario decided to outsmart the coolest game of all time
    “Railway Runner”. But as always he needs your help. Given a
    railway pattern, he wants to figure out if it is possible to
    get from one end to the other. Input is given in <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> horizontal lines, each of which
    contains three characters denoting the three railways. Each
    cell can be “*” - part of a train, “.” - rails, and “/” -
    ladder to the roof of the train. You start on the ground on the
    first row of cells and your goal is to reach the end of the
    track, which consists of the cells in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>-th row. Here are the rules of the
    game:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>You can move left and right between two trains (“*”) or
        two rails (“.”) that are adjacent to each other, but you
        cannot go backward (up). No diagonal moves are allowed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can only get on a train from an adjacent train or
        via a ladder (“/”).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can jump down on the rails from a train rooftop
        without hurting yourself. You cannot jump off the train to
        an adjacent line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assume the input is valid (i.e. each ladder is followed
        by a train and preceded by a rail).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can start on any column in the first row as long as
        it’s a rail (“.”). You can finish on any column in the last
        row without further restrictions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While on a ladder, you must move forward to the
        corresponding train roof and climb the ladder.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 100 \, 000$</span>),
    representing the length of the railway that you are running
    across.<br/>
    Then follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines of
    input denoting a row of cells. Each line is a sequence of 3
    characters chosen from <span class="tex2jax_process">$[* \; .
    \; /]$</span>, representing a train, rail, or ladder
    respectively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing either string “YES” or “NO”,
    depending on if you can reach the other side of the
    railway.</p>
