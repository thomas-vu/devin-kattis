<p>“We will be closing in about 5 minutes. Thank you for
    visiting the ICPC gym today.”</p>
<p>With this announcement, Alice and Bob stopped playing their
    rock-paper-scissors marathon in the middle of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>th game. Each player scores a
    point if their throw beats the other player’s throw. Each game
    was played by the <em>first-to-11</em> rule, meaning that
    whoever scores <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span> points
    first wins the game. Today, Bob narrowly defeated Alice by a
    single game; he scored 11 points first in five games, while
    Alice only scored 11 points first in four games.</p>
<p>After carefully inspecting how each game was played,
    however, Alice realized that she could have won more games than
    Bob if they played under slightly different rules, such as
    <em>first-to-5</em> or <em>first-to-8</em>, instead of the
    regular <em>first-to-11</em>.</p>
<p>Given the sequence of points scored by Alice and Bob,
    determine all values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> such that Alice would have won
    more games than Bob under the <em>first-to-</em><span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> rule.</p>
<p>Both Alice and Bob start with zero points at the beginning
    of a game. As soon as one player reaches <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> points, that player wins the game,
    and a new game starts. Alice wins a game if she scores
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> points before Bob
    does. Neither player wins the game if it’s interrupted by the
    gym closing before either player reaches <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> points.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The single line of input consists of a string of uppercase
    letters “<tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>” or “<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>”, denoting who scored each point from the
    beginning of the rock-paper-scissors marathon. The length of
    the string is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000$</span> letters,
    inclusive. “<tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>” means Alice scored the
    point, “<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>” means Bob scored the
    point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>On the first line, output the number of positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> for which a
    <em>first-to-</em><span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> rule
    would have made Alice win more games than Bob. If this number
    isn’t zero, on the next line output all such values of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> in increasing order,
    separated by spaces.</p>
