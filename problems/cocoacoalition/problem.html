<p>Alice and Bob decide to share a chocolate bar, which is an
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> rectangular grid of chocolate
    cells. They decide that Alice should get <span class="tex2jax_process">$a &lt; n \cdot m$</span> pieces and that Bob
    should get <span class="tex2jax_process">$b = n \cdot m -
    a$</span> pieces. To split the chocolate bar, they repeatedly
    take a single piece of chocolate and break it either
    horizontally or vertically, creating two smaller pieces of
    chocolate. See FigureÂ 1 for an example.</p>
<p>What is the minimum number of splits that Alice and Bob need
    to perform in order to split the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-by-<span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> chocolate bar into two piles
    consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> chocolate cells?</p>

<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum number of splits needed to achieve the
    desired division of chocolate.</p>
