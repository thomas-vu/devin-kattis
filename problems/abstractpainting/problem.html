<p>Everyday, Gon practices his painting skill on a rectangular
    canvas, divided into <span class="tex2jax_process">$R \cdot
    C$</span> unit squares, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rows and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> columns. Gon wants to paint all
    the edges of all unit squares.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular belief, creating a good modern painting
    is not an easy task. A good modern painting should use a
    limited number of colors, simple yet elegant. Thus, when
    creating his painting, Gon strictly adheres to the following
    rules:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Only <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> colors are
        used: Red, Green and Blue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All edges of all unit squares must be painted. Each edge
        must be painted with exactly one color.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each unit square, exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> colors must be used to paint
        its <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> edges.
        Furthermore, each color must be used to paint exactly
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> edges.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following figure:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The painting on the left is a good painting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The painting on the right is <b class="bfseries">not</b>
        a good painting, because the top-left unit square has
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> blue edges.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</center>
<p>Now Gon is wondering, how many different good paintings are
    there? Two paintings, both with <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rows and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> columns, are considered different,
    if there exists one edge painted with different colors in the
    two paintings. Please help Gon!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains exactly one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> — the number of test cases
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le T \le 5)$</span>.</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines follow, each
    line contains exactly two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \le R \le 14, 1 \le C \le 2\, 000)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    lines, each line contains a single integer — the number of
    different good paintings, modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{9} + 7$</span>.</p>
