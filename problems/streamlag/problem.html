<p>Live stream audiences often encounter undesired stream lag.
    The lag may occur for multiple reasons, such as slow network
    speed, high stream resolution, not enough processing power on
    the client hardware, etc. In this problem, we will model and
    compute the stream lag for one hypothetical stream.</p>
<p>The stream has a video content that is segmented into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> network packets to
    send, numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Each packet contains
    a small segment of the streamed video with a length of exactly
    one second. A stream lag is a time period in which the stream
    audience is not watching any content while waiting for the
    stream packets to arrive. Ideally, a stream audience
    experiencing zero lag shall receive packet <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> at the beginning of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th second, in which
    case the audience can seamlessly watch the entire streamed
    video.</p>
<p>In reality, any of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> packets may be received at any
    moment, and not necessarily in order from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. A stream client will only start
    playing packet <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> if it
    has played all its preceding packets. If this is not the case,
    the stream client will wait until all packets before
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> have been received and
    played. The stream client keeps all received packets that
    cannot yet be played in its buffer and is able to retrieve them
    in no time when they are ready to be played. If a packet is not
    available when the time to play it arrives, the stream lags and
    viewers fall behind from the live stream. The stream client
    plays each packet for exactly one second at its original speed.
    All packets are to be played even when the play time lags much
    behind the live stream.</p>
<p>Given the arrival time of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> packets in chronological order,
    compute the total lag time that a stream audience will
    experience.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input has a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span>). This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th line has two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq t_ i \leq 10^9, 1 \leq i \leq n$</span>), which means that
    packet <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> arrives at the
    beginning of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>th
    second. The values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_
    i$</span>â€™s are non-decreasing. Packets may arrive at the same
    time.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the total lag time based on the given packet arrival
    time.</p>
