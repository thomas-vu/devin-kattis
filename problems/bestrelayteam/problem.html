</div>You are the coach of the national athletics team and need
    to select which sprinters should represent your country in the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4 \times 100$</span> m relay in
    the upcoming championships.

    <p>As the name of the event implies, such a sprint relay
    consist of <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> legs,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> meters each. One
    would think that the best team would simply consist of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> fastest <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> m runners in the nation, but
    there is an important detail to take into account: flying
    start. In the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>nd,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>rd and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>th leg, the runner is already
    running when the baton is handed over. This means that some
    runners – those that have a slow acceleration phase – can
    perform relatively better in a relay if they are on the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>nd, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>rd or <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>th leg.</p>
<p>You have a pool of runners to choose from. Given how fast
    each runner in the pool is, decide which four runners should
    represent your national team and which leg they should run. You
    are given two times for each runner – the time the runner would
    run the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>st leg, and the
    time the runner would run any of the other legs. A runner in a
    team can only run one leg.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of runners to choose
    from (<span class="tex2jax_process">$4 \leq n \leq
    500$</span>). Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines describing the runners. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th of these lines
    contains the name of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th runner, the time <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> for the runner to run the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>st leg, and the time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> for the runner to
    run any of the other legs (<span class="tex2jax_process">$8 \le
    b_ i \le a_ i &lt; 20$</span>). The names consist of between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> (inclusive) uppercase letters
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>’-‘<tt class="ttfamily">Z</tt>’,
    and no two runners have the same name. The times are given in
    seconds with exactly two digits after the decimal point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>First, output a line containing the time of the best team,
    accurate to an absolute or relative error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-9}$</span>. Then output
    four lines containing the names of the runners in that team.
    The first of these lines should contain the runner you have
    picked for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>st leg,
    the second line the runner you have picked for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>nd leg, and so on. Any solution
    that results in the fastest team is acceptable.</p>
