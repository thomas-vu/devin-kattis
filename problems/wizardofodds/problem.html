<div class="problembody">
<p>You have just completed a brave journey to see <em>The
    Wizard of Odds</em>, who agrees to grant you any wish, so long
    as you can complete the following puzzle:</p>
<p>The Wizard starts by telling you two integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>. He then secretly selects a number
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (inclusive), and does not tell you
    this number.</p>
<p>Your goal is to correctly guess the secret number. Before
    guessing, you are allowed to ask <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> “true/false” questions about the
    number, for example, <em>“Is the number even?”</em> or <em>“Is
    the number between <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>?”</em>, or <em>“Is
    the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span> or
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$22$</span>?”</em>, or <em>“Is
    the number prime?”</em>. And the Wizard will answer with “true”
    or “false” to each question. The Wizard will always answer
    honestly. After answering the <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> questions, you must guess the
    number. If you win (guess the number correctly), you will be
    granted your wish; but if the Wizard wins (you guess
    incorrectly), you will be turned into a flying monkey.</p>
<p>(Formally, you can think of a “question” as a function from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \ldots , N$</span> to
    <em>true, false</em>, and the Wizard will answer by telling you
    whether the value of the function is <em>true</em> or
    <em>false</em> for his secret number.)</p>
<p>Assuming that you have been told <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, can you always exactly determine
    the Wizard’s secret number (and guarantee that you win) using
    only <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> questions?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 10^{101}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq K \leq N$</span>), separated by a single space.</p>
<p><em>Note: These inputs might NOT fit into a <span class="tex2jax_process">$64$</span>-bit integer.</em></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “<tt class="ttfamily">Your wish is granted!</tt>”
    (without the quotes) if it is possible for you to guarantee
    that you win the game (regardless of the number the Wizard
    picks). Otherwise, print “<tt class="ttfamily">You will become
    a flying monkey!</tt>” (without the quotes) if it is not
    possible.</p>
