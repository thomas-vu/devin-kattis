<div class="problembody">
<p>Your long journey through the cosmos has begun, and you have
    many stops along the way. This journey will take generations,
    so you need to find the most efficient route from Earth,
    located at intergalactic coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(X_0, Y_0, Z_0)$</span>, to each of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> planets, asteroids,
    and space stations along the way, each with initial coordinates
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(X_ i, Y_ i, Z_ i)$</span>.</p>
<p>Of course, the universe isn’t a static system: each
    celestial body has an initial velocity <span class="tex2jax_process">$(\overline{X_ i}, \overline{Y_ i},
    \overline{Z_ i})$</span>, and its mass <span class="tex2jax_process">$M_ i$</span> generates a gravitational pull
    on other bodies, creating an acceleration of <span class="tex2jax_process">$-\hat{r} \frac{G M_ i}{r^2}$</span>, where
    for this problem we set the gravitational constant <span class="tex2jax_process">$G = 1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is the Euclidean distance between
    the two celestial bodies involved in the gravitational
    interaction, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$-\hat{r}$</span> signifies that the
    acceleration is towards the other body (i.e. they attract each
    other along the line connecting them).</p>
<p>Since you may approach the speed of light, you need to take
    into account the effects of special relativity. In particular,
    the formula <span class="tex2jax_process">$E_ i^2 = (M_ i
    c^2)^2 + (p_ i c)^2$</span> can come in handy, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$E_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> are the total energy and
    momentum respectively of object <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is the speed of light (for this
    problem, we’ll set <span class="tex2jax_process">$c =
    1$</span>, effectively using Planck units). Moreover, you may
    encounter black holes, around which you’ll need to incorporate
    the combined effects of general relativity and quantum
    mechanics, which the margins of this problem statement are too
    small to contain. As a well-prepared team, you should of course
    have these formulas ready to go in your code book.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the presence of a fleet of space cats adds an
    additional layer of complexity to this problem. Their unique
    needs must be taken into account during the optimization
    process, requiring the integration of advanced, feline-specific
    biometric monitoring systems into the spacecraft’s control
    mechanism. The solution must also consider the impact of
    intergalactic space-cat field fluctuations on the subatomic
    matrix structure and the temporal-spatial discordance, leading
    to a significant deviation in the quantum harmonic oscillation
    and gravitational wave interference.</p>
<p>The space cats have just reminded me that it’s April Fools’
    Day! They’ll be happy if you can just write a program which
    determines the average temperature of a planet given a set of
    readings: can you help them out?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two lines. The first line contains an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq 10^4$</span>), representing
    the number of temperature readings taken on the planet’s
    surface. The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq T_ i \leq 10^5$</span>), representing
    the temperature readings in Kelvin.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should be a single integer, representing the mean
    temperature out of the given readings for the planet in Kelvin,
    rounded down.</p>
