<p>3D printing is a technique for manufacturing items from a
    digital template. The printer lays down layers of a polymer
    material, building an entire 3D object as a series of flat
    plates of varying shapes, stacked upon one another. The polymer
    is initially sticky enough so that the plates printed on top of
    one another will adhere. After the object dries or cures, the
    resulting objects can be quite durable.</p>
<p>Consider a 3D printer in which objects to be printed are
    described as a template, consisting of a combination of several
    convex polyhedra (i.e., flat-surfaced objects such that a line
    from one interior point to another interior point never passes
    outside the volume of the object). Write a program to determine
    the total volume of polymer required to sculpt an object from a
    given template.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There will be a single test case in the input. This test
    case will begin with a line with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 100$</span>) representing the number of polyhedra in
    that template.</p>
<p>The subsequent lines describe the n polyhedra. Each
    polyhedron begins with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3 &lt; f &lt; 30$</span>), which is the
    number of faces on the polyhedron. Following that line is a
    series of lines describing polygons that comprise the faces.
    Each such line begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \le v \le 24$</span>), which is the number of vertices.
    Following <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> on the same
    line will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \cdot v$</span>
    real numbers, representing the <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> vertices as <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y,z)$</span> coordinates. For example, if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v=3$</span>, then the line would
    be</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">    v x1 y1 z1 x2
    y2 z2 x3 y3 z3</tt></p>
<p>All coordinates will be in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-100 \ldots 100]$</span>. Vertices are
    presented in sequential order; there will be an edge of the
    polygon from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1,y_1,z_1)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2,y_2,z_2)$</span>, from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2,y_2,z_2)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_3,y_3,z_3)$</span>, and so on. The
    polygons are closed, so there is an implied edge from the last
    vertex in a polygon back to the first. All of the vertices of a
    face will be coplanar. Edges will not cross, and each vertex
    will lie on exactly two edges. No three (or more) vertices in a
    polygon will be collinear. None of the polyhedra will
    overlap.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a real number on its own line, indicating the volume
    of polymer required in cubic centimeters. The volume should be
    printed with a precision of two decimal places, rounded.</p>
