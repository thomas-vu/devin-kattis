<p>You are in a chemistry class, and you are working with some
    compounds, exactly one of which you are allergic to. You have a
    fixed number of days to figure out which compound it is. You
    set up a number of sites on your arm for testing. On each day,
    you do the following exactly once:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Apply each compound to some (possibly empty) subset of
        sites on your arm. You can apply more than one compound to
        the same site.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait and see which sites demonstrate an allergic
        reaction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A site demonstrates an allergic reaction if and only if the
    compound you are allergic to is applied to that site. If a site
    demonstrates an allergic reaction, it cannot be used on future
    days.</p>
<p>Compute the minimum number of sites youâ€™ll need on your arm
    to guarantee that you can determine exactly which compound you
    are allergic to within the given number of days.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le t \le 10^4$</span>), which is the
    number of test cases that follow.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>
    lines contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n,d \le 10^{18}$</span>) describing a test case, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of
    compounds and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is the
    number of days.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> lines. On
    each line output a single integer, which is the minimum number
    of sites on your arm necessary to discover which of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> compounds is the
    allergen within <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> days
    for that test case. Output the answers to the test cases in the
    order they appear in the input.</p>
