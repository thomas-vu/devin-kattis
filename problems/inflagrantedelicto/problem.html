<p><i class="itshape">“[There] is a reason why the most
    successful trial lawyers are often master storytellers, making
    their cases come to life for their jurors.” ­–G. Christopher
    Ritter.</i></p>
<p>A good lawyer can take an incomplete set of facts and turn
    it into a convincing story.</p>
<p>Last night, a major robbery occurred at a bank, and,
    luckily, the robber seems to have been successfully arrested.
    Unfortunately, it is neither clear what the order of events
    was, nor whether the man they caught is even really the right
    guy. It is necessary to reconstruct the correct order of events
    to convince the jury that the accused is guilty beyond
    reasonable doubt for a conviction to be reached.</p>
<p>It is known that there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> material events that are relevant
    to the case. For simplicity, we label the events <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \dots , N$</span>. The prosecution
    claims that these events happened in the order <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_1, P_2, \dots , P_ N$</span>, while the
    defense claims that these events instead happened in the order
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_1, D_2, \dots , D_ N$</span>.
    It is guaranteed that exactly one of the two is right; in
    particular, this also means that the prosecution and defense do
    not claim the exact same order of events; that is, there exists
    some <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> such that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i \neq D_ i$</span>.</p>
<p>Define a <i class="itshape">consistent recollection</i> as a
    subset of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> events,
    in some order, such that these events happening in this order
    is consistent with at least one of the two parties’ claims.
    (That is, at least one of the parties claimed that this subset
    of events did happen in this order, although it is possible
    that some other events happened before, after, or in between.)
    You need to determine</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>the <i class="itshape">minimum</i> <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_ p$</span> such that there is some
        consistent recollection of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_ p$</span> events where it is possible
        to determine for sure who is right, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the <i class="itshape">minimum</i> <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_ r$</span> such that for <i class="itshape">any</i> consistent recollection of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_ r$</span> events, it is possible to
        determine for sure who is right.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>By finding these numbers, you can help the prosecution
    estimate the minimum amount of evidence they need to make their
    case, and the minimum amount of evidence they need to make
    their case foolproof. (Or determine that the man they have is
    really innocent.) Please help!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 200\, 000$</span>), the number
    of events.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_1, P_2, \dots , P_ N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq P_ i \leq N$</span>; all <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span> are distinct), the order of
    events according to the prosecution. That is, according to the
    prosecution, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text
    {th}$</span> event was the event labelled <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span>.</p>
<p>The third line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_1, D_2, \dots , D_ N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq D_ i \leq N$</span>; all <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ i$</span> are distinct), the order of
    events according to the defense. That is, according to the
    defense, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text
    {th}$</span> event was the event labelled <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ i$</span>.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that the prosecution and defense do not
    claim the exact same order of events; that is, there exists
    some <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> such that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i \neq D_ i$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two integers on a single line, the minimum values of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_ p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_ r$</span>, respectively, as described in
    the problem statement.</p>
