</div>We’re working on a new super-computer, built to unleash
    the hidden computing powers of all eight dimensions of reality.
    The secret to utilizing more dimensions turns out to be to use
    counting registers of different sizes. In particular, we have
    eight registers, counting cyclically modulo the different
    primes <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$19$</span>. A size <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> register stores a value between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p-1$</span> (inclusive).

    <p>The only operation available is an “increment” operation.
    When it is performed, the size <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> register is increased by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. If this increment
    causes overflow (i.e., if the old value was <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>) the value is reset to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, and the size
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> is incremented. If
    this causes overflow the size <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> register is reset to <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and the size <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> register is incremented, and so
    on. If this goes all the way to the last register and the size
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$19$</span> register overflows,
    the computer blows up.</p>
<p>In order not to destroy the computer in testing, we need to
    build a program to check the safety of doing increment
    operations before we perform them. Given the current state of
    the registers, you need to compute how many more operations can
    safely be performed before the computer blows up.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing eight
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_2$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_7$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_{11}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_{13}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_{17}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_{19}$</span> indicating the current values
    of the registers. The value of the size <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> register is always between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p-1$</span> (inclusive).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Ouput a single line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of additional
    operations that can be performed without the computer blowing
    up.</p>
