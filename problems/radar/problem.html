<p>After your boat ran out of fuel in the middle of the ocean,
    you have been following the currents for 80 days. Today, you
    finally got your radar equipment working. And it’s receiving
    signals!</p>
<p>Alas, the signals come from the “radar” station owned by the
    eccentric lighthouse keeper Hasse. Hasse’s radar station (which
    does not work quite like other radar stations) emits continuous
    signals of three different wave-lengths. Therefore, the only
    interesting thing you can measure is the phase of a signal as
    it reaches you. For example, if the signal you tuned on to has
    a wave-length of <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>
    meters and you are <span class="tex2jax_process">$1456$</span>
    meters from the station, your equipment can only tell you that
    you are either <span class="tex2jax_process">$56$</span>, or
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$156$</span>, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$256$</span>, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$\dots $</span> meters away from the
    lighthouse.</p>
<p>So you reach for your last piece of paper to start
    calculating – but wait, there’s a catch! On the display you
    read: “ACCURACY: 3 METERS”. So, in fact, the information you
    get from this signal is that your distance from Hasse’s radar
    station is in the union of intervals <span class="tex2jax_process">$[53,59] \cup [153, 159] \cup [253, 259] \cup
    \dots $</span>.</p>
<p>What to do? Since the key to surviving at sea is to be
    optimistic, you are interested in what the smallest possible
    distance to the lighthouse could be, given the wavelengths,
    measurements and accuracies corresponding to the three
    signals.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Given three positive prime numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_3$</span> (the wavelengths), three
    nonnegative integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_3$</span> (the measurements), and three
    nonnegative integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_3$</span> (the accuracies), find the
    smallest nonnegative integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span> (the smallest possible distance)
    such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span> is within
    distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span> from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_ i$</span> for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$i = 1,2,3$</span>. An integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x’$</span> is <em>within distance</em>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> from <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> if there is some integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$x \equiv x’ + t \pmod{m}$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$|t| \leq y$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There are three lines of input. The first line is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_1$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_2$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_3$</span>, the second is <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_3$</span> and the third is <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_2$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_3$</span>. You may assume that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; m_ i \leq 10^6$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x_ i &lt; m_ i$</span>,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq y_ i \leq 300$</span>
    for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. The numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_3$</span> are all primes and distinct.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print one line with the answer <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span>. Note that the answer might not
    fit in a 32-bit integer.</p>
