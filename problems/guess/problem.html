<div class="problembody">
<p>I am thinking of a number between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span>, can you guess what number it
    is? Given a guess, I will tell you whether the guess is too
    low, too high, or correct. But I will only give you
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> guesses, so use them
    wisely!</p>
<h2>Interaction</h2>
<p>Your program should output guesses for the correct number,
    in the form of an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span> on a line on its own. After
    making each guess, you need to make sure to flush standard
    out.</p>
<p>After each guess, there will be a response to be read from
    standard in. This response is a line with one of the following
    three words:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>“<tt class="ttfamily">lower</tt>” if the number I am
        thinking of is lower than your guess</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<tt class="ttfamily">higher</tt>” if the number I am
        thinking of is higher than your guess</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<tt class="ttfamily">correct</tt>” if your guess is
        correct</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After having guessed the right answer your program should
    exit. If you guess incorrectly <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> times, you won’t get any more
    chances and your program will be terminated.</p>
