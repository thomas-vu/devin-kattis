<p>After seeing all the beautiful landscaping around Cossin,
    Yraglac is inspired to work on his own gardening. Since food is
    such a scarce commodity on Mars, he decides it would be nice to
    plant an agricultural crop: Martian rice. The unique thing
    about Martian rice is that it will only grow in flat areas
    where water can pool, which makes it important to terrace the
    garden carefully. Given a height profile of Yraglac’s garden,
    can you help him determine how much of the land can grow rice
    on?</p>
<p>Yraglac’s garden is divided into a regular grid of perfectly
    square <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \textrm{ m } \times 1
    \textrm{ m}$</span> cells, and he provides you a map indicating
    the exact height of the land within each cell. The entire
    garden is surrounded by a wall that is higher than the highest
    cell. In our model of the Mars world, rain water (real or
    artificial) can flow from a cell to any of its four adjacent
    cells (north, east, south, or west), provided the adjacent
    cell’s height is lower than or equal to the cell’s height. A
    cell is said to be able to collect or pool water if any water
    landing in the cell cannot flow to another cell of lower
    height, either directly or through any of its neighbouring
    cells. Arrows in the diagram below illustrate possible
    directions of water flow between cells, and circles indicate
    the four cells that can collect water.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x \; y$</span>, which indicate the
    dimensions of Yraglac’s garden, in metres (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le x, y \le 500$</span>). Then following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> lines containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_{ij}$</span>, each which indicate the
    heights of each cell in Yraglac’s garden (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le h_{ij} \le 999$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of square metres of land that Yraglac can
    grow his rice crop on.</p>
