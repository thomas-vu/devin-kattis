<p>After acquiring a new integer and showing it off to other
    couples at a cocktail party, Alice and Bob headed home for a
    good night of sleep. As their integer was quite large, they
    were forced to carry it together. Then, on the Boole Boulevard,
    right by the Bayes Bay, disaster struck. History does not tell
    us which of our two protagonists stumbled first, but stumble
    they did, and their integer shattered into <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> positive integral pieces on the
    pavement in front of them.</p>
<p>The couple’s marriage, already under financial stress due to
    the expensive integer acquisition, did not survive this event,
    and Bob and Alice resolved to separate. Thus the question was
    raised on how to split the remnants of their integer. Bob and
    Alice decided to play a game with the remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> pieces: the two would repeatedly
    choose pieces in alternating turns until none were left.</p>
<p>Bob and Alice, both very materialistic, seek to acquire the
    largest possible sum of integers possible. Compute the value of
    the integers each of them ends up with. Assume both players
    play optimally. Since <i class="itshape">A</i> comes before
    <i class="itshape">B</i> in the alphabet, Alice moves
    first.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two lines.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>A single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n
        \leq 15$</span>, the number of pieces.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The values of the pieces <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_0, a_1, \dots , a_{n-1}$</span>,
        space-separated. It is given that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a_ i \leq 100$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing two integers, the combined
    value of Alice’s pieces, and the combined value of Bob’s
    pieces.</p>
