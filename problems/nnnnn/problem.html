<p>Hsara and Simone like to communicate without anyone else
    knowing what theyâ€™re saying. This time, Simone invented a very
    sneaky cipher. When she wants to tell Hsara a non-negative
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, she performs
    the following encryption procedure.</p>
<p>Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$d(n)$</span> denote the
    decimal expansion of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.
    Consider the string <span class="tex2jax_process">$x := d(n)^
    n$</span>, i.e., the decimal expansion of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> concatenated with itself
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> times. The encryption
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is then the length
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>.</p>
<p>As an example, assume Simone wants to encrypt the number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. Then</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ x = 10101010101010101010. \]</span>
<p>The length of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is
    then <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>, which will be
    the encrypted value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>.</p>
<p>Hsara had no problem writing a decryption algorithm for this
    procedure. But can you?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq L \leq 10^{{10}^6}$</span>), the encrypted value of some
    non-negative integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
