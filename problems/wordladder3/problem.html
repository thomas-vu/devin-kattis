<div class="problembody">
<p>You and Alice are solving word ladder puzzles. A <i class="itshape">word ladder</i> is a sequence of words, all with the
    same number of letters, where each word in the sequence differs
    from the previous word by a single letter.</p>
<p>Because you are better at creating word ladders than at
    solving them, you have decided to devise a very specific puzzle
    for Alice. You will give Alice a list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> words. Then, she will construct a
    word ladder from your word list. Alice must start from the
    first word in your list, and modify one letter at a time to
    obtain the last word in your list. Each intermediate word Alice
    uses must also be from your word list.</p>
<p>Alice is so good at solving word ladder puzzles that she
    always produces the shortest word ladder possible. You want to
    force Alice to use all <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    words in her word ladder. There should be no way to construct a
    shorter word ladder from the starting word to the ending word
    using the words in your word list.</p>
<p>Create a list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    words, such that the shortest word ladder from the first word
    to the last word uses all the words in the list. Because you
    need to verify the word ladder solution before giving the
    puzzle to Alice, the word list should be given in word ladder
    order.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The single line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le n \le 5\, 000$</span>), which is the
    length of the word list (and solution word ladder) you must
    construct for Alice.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines. Each
    line contains a single word of length at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> letters. The words must all be
    distinct, of the same length, and consist only of lowercase
    letters. Note that for this problem, a word is simply a string
    of lowercase letters; it does not have to be an English
    word.</p>
<p>The list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> words
    should be printed in word ladder order, such that each word
    differs from the previous word by a single letter. There should
    exist no shorter word ladder from the first word to the last
    word using fewer than <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    words from the list.</p>
<p>It can be proven that an answer exists for all <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> satisfying the input constraint.
    Any answer satisfying these requirements will be considered
    correct.</p>
