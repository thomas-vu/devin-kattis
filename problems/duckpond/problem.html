<p>Suppose there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    ducks floating on the pond in a circle. The pond is also home
    for an alligator with a fondness for ducks. Beginning at a
    particular position (duck number 1) the alligator counts around
    the circle and eats every <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>th duck (the circle closing as
    ducks are eaten). For example, when <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = 8$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m = 4$</span>, the following diagram shows
    duck number outside each node and consumption order inside:</p>

<img alt="\includegraphics[scale=0.4]{duckpond.png}" src="/problems/duckpond/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:; height:"/>
</center>
</div>
<p>The first duck is fifth on the menu, the second is fourth,
    etc. The sequence <tt class="ttfamily">5 4 6 1 3 8 7 2</tt> or
    orders of consumption completely describes the alligatorâ€™s
    menu.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n &lt; 99$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq m &lt; 99$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print out the orders of consumption of the ducks on a single
    line.</p>
