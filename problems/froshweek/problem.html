<p>During Frosh Week, students play various fun games to get to
    know each other and compete against other teams. In one such
    game, all the frosh on a team stand in a line, and are then
    asked to arrange themselves according to some criterion, such
    as their height, their birth date, or their student number.
    This rearrangement of the line must be accomplished only by
    successively swapping pairs of consecutive students. The team
    that finishes fastest wins. Thus, in order to win, you would
    like to minimize the number of swaps required.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of
    students on the team, which will be no more than one million.
    The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    each contain one integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> (inclusive), the student number
    of each student on the team. No student number will appear more
    than once.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a line containing the minimum number of swaps
    required to arrange the students in increasing order by student
    number.</p>
