<p>The people of Absurdistan discovered how to build roads only
    last year. After the discovery, each city decided to build its
    own road, connecting the city to some other city. Each newly
    built road can be used in both directions.</p>
<p>You bought a tourist guide which has a map of the country
    with the newly built roads. However, since you are very
    interested in history, you would like to know which city built
    which road.</p>
<p>Given the description of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> roads, can you find an assignment
    of roads to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cities,
    such that each city built one road? If there are multiple
    assignments, you are happy with any one. At least one solution
    is guaranteed to exist.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2\le n\le 100\, 000)$</span> – the number
    of cities and roads. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines with <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> numbers each. A line containing
    “<span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>” indicates that there is a road
    between cities <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a, b\le n, a \not= b$</span>. There
    can be multiple roads between the same pair of cities.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines with
    two integers “<span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>” denoting that a road
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> was built by city
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>. Each road from the
    input must appear exactly once in the output. If there are
    multiple solutions, you can print any one and you can print the
    roads in any order.</p>
