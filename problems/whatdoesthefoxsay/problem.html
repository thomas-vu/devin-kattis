<div class="problembody">
<p>Determined to discover the ancient mystery—the sound that
    the fox makes—you went into the forest, armed with a very good
    digital audio recorder. The forest is, however, full of
    animals’ voices, and on your recording, many different sounds
    can be heard. But you are well prepared for your task: you know
    exactly all the sounds which other animals make. Therefore the
    rest of the recording—all the unidentified noises—must have
    been made by the fox.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the number of test cases
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>. The descriptions of
    the test cases follow:</p>
<p>The first line of each test case contains the
    recording—words over lower case English alphabet, separated by
    spaces. Each contains at most 100 letters and there are no more
    than 100 words. The next few lines are your pre-gathered
    information about other animals, in the format <tt class="ttfamily">&lt;animal&gt; goes &lt;sound&gt;</tt>. There are no
    more than 100 animals, their names are not longer than 100
    letters each and are actual names of animals in English. There
    is no <tt class="ttfamily">fox goes ...</tt> among these
    lines.</p>
<p>The last line of the test case is exactly the question you
    are supposed to answer: <em>what does the fox say?</em></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing the sounds
    made by the fox, in the order from the recording. You may
    assume that the fox was not silent (contrary to popular belief,
    foxes do not communicate by Morse code).</p>
