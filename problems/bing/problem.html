    engineers to do the work for them. Bing knows that performance
    is the name of the game when it comes to the world wide web,
    and because of this they want to make their typeahead is as
    performant as possible. Your task is to analyze the stream of
    searches coming in, and let everyone know how many of these
    searches began with the letters currently in the search
    bar.</p>

    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. The following

<h2>Output</h2>
