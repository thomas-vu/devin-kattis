<p>Yesterday was Sam’s birthday. The most interesting gift was
    definitely the chessboard. Sam quickly learned the rules of
    chess and defeated his father, all his friends, his little
    sister, and now no one wants to play with him any more.</p>
<p>So he decided to play with another birthday gift – a Book of
    Math Problems for Young Mathematicians. He opened the book
    somewhere in the middle and read the following problem: "How
    many knights can be placed on a chessboard without threatening
    each other?" After a while he realized that this was trivial
    and moved on to the next problem: "How many bishops can be
    placed on a chessboard without threatening each other?". Sam is
    in trouble here. He is not able to solve this problem and needs
    your help.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Sam’s chessboard has size <span class="tex2jax_process">$N\times N$</span>. A bishop can move to any
    distance in any of the four diagonal directions. A bishop
    threatens another bishop if it can move to the other bishop’s
    position. Your task is to compute the maximum number of bishops
    that can be placed on a chessboard in such a way that no two
    bishops threaten each other.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input file consists of several lines. The line number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> contains a positive
    integer representing the size of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th chessboard. The size of each
    chessboard is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output file should contain the same number of lines as
    the input file. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    line should contain one number – the maximum number of bishops
    that can be placed on <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th chessboard without threatening
    each other.</p>
