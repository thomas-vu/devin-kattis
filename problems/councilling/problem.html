<div class="problembody">
<p>Each resident of a particular town is a member of zero or
    more clubs and also a member of exactly one political party.
    Each club is to appoint one of its members to represent it on
    the town council so that the number of council members
    belonging to any given party does not equal or exceed half the
    membership of the council. The same person may not represent
    two clubs; that is there must be a 1-1 relationship between
    clubs and council members. Your job is to select the council
    members subject to these constraints.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>In the first line of input there will be an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \le 12$</span>, giving the
    number of test cases.</p>
<p>Each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    testcases begins with a line with the number of residents
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span>. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain a
    resident, a party, the number of clubs the resident belongs to
    (at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$110$</span>) and the
    names of such clubs. Each resident appears in exactly one input
    line.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, follow the following format: Each line
    should name a council member followed by the club represented
    by the member. If several answers are possible, any will do. If
    no council can be formed, print “Impossible.” in a line. There
    will be a blank line in between two test cases.</p>
