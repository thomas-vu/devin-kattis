<p>To widen their mixological horizons, some of your bar’s
    patrons have decided to work themselves through the entire
    drink menu, top to bottom, over a period of many visits. Due to
    their forgetfulness, decreptitude, or levels of inebriation,
    these patrons cannot be trusted with keeping track of how far
    they’ve progressed down the menu.</p>
<p>Thus, you decide to take responsibility for always serving
    the right drink to the right customer, so that each customer
    goes through the menu in order from top to bottom, no matter in
    which order the customers arrive.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> of drinks and the number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> of orders, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 1\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq m\leq 10\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    contain the name of a drink, in the order of the drink menu.
    The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
    each contain the name of a customer ordering a drink. Both
    drink and customer names consist of alphabetic characters from
    A-Z, a–z, and space; each name is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> characters long and neither
    starts nor ends with space. The drinks and the customers have
    unique names. There are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> different customers. It is
    guaranteed that no customer orders more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> drinks.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
    containing the drinks you serve in the proper order.</p>
