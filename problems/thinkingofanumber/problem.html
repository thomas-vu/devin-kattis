<p>Let’s play a guessing game. I’m thinking of a positive
    integer that’s greater than five and less than eleven and
    divisible by three. Of course, I could be thinking of either
    six or nine. Your job is to supply a program that can play
    guessing games like this. Given a collection of clues, your
    program should report all numbers that satisfy the clues.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a number of test cases (at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>). Each case starts
    with a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq
    10$</span> on a line by itself. Next come <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> clues, one per line. Clues have
    the form “greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>”, “less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>” or “divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>” for some integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \le 50\, 000$</span>. A value of
    zero for <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> marks the end
    of all test cases.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, your program should report all positive
    integers that are consistent with the given clues. Values
    should be given on a single line in ascending order, with one
    space between consecutive values. If no values are consistent
    with the clues, print “none”. If infinitely many values are
    consistent with the clues, print out “infinite”.</p>
