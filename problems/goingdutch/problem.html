</div>You and your friends have just returned from a beautiful
    vacation in the mountains of the Netherlands. When on vacation,
    it’s annoying to split the bill on every expense every time, so
    you just kept all the receipts from the vacation, and wrote
    down who paid how much for who. Now, it is time to settle the
    bill.

    <p>You could each take all the receipts showing that someone
    paid something for you, and then pay that person back. But then
    you would need a <em>lot</em> of transactions, and you want to
    keep up the lazy spirit from your trip. In the end, it does not
    matter who transfers money to whom; as long as in the end,
    everyone’s balance is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<p>Can you figure out the least number of transactions needed
    to settle the score? Assume everyone has enough spare cash to
    transfer an arbitrary amount of money to another person.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>A line containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, the number of people in the
        group, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq M \leq
        20$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>,
        the number of receipts from the trip, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq N\leq 1000$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, each
        with three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a, b,
        p$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a,b
        &lt; M$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p
        \leq 1000$</span>, signifying a receipt showing that person
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> paid <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> euros for person <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing a single integer, the least
    number of transactions necessary to settle all bills.</p>
