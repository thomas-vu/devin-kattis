<div class="problembody">
<p>For this problem, you just need to be able to calculate the
    area of convex polygons.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100$</span>, indicating the
    number of convex polygons. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain one convex
    polygon description. Each begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le m \le 100$</span> indicating the
    number of points in the polygon. Following this are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> pairs of integers,
    where each pair represents the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates of a vertex. The
    bounds on the coordinates are <span class="tex2jax_process">$-5\, 000 \le x, y \le 5\, 000$</span>. The
    vertices are given in counter-clockwise order, and no two
    vertices are the same. As is typical for a polygon, the last
    vertex is connected to the first one.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each polygon, output its area.</p>
