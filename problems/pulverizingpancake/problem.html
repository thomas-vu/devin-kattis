        The Living Embodiment of Doom
      </div>
</div>
<p>You were walking along minding your own business when you
    were suddenly ambushed by a horde of wild Pokemon. The world is
    a grid with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> columns
    numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, and each Pokemon is
    in one of the columns hoping to trap you, but you have come
    prepared. You brought your trusty Snorlax who knows how to use
    one of the most powerful moves known to Pokemon-kind:
    Pulverizing Pancake. When it uses this move, Snorlax barrels
    down any one of the columns defeating any Pokemon in his
    path.</p>
<p>His impact is so large that Pokemon in adjacent columns get
    pushed into the column one over. For example, if Snorlax
    barrels down column <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>,
    Pokemon in column <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> will
    be defeated, any Pokemon in column <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> will be pushed into column
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> (but not defeated),
    and any Pokemon in column <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> will be pushed into column
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>. The pushing effect
    always happens unless the Pokemon getting pushed are on the
    first or last columns of the world (i.e. Snorlax barrels down
    column <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> or column
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span>), in which case the
    Pokemon in adjacent columns donâ€™t move (since there is no
    column for them to be pushed to). The effect only occurs in the
    two adjacent columns to Snorlax; it is not a chain reaction
    across the entire grid.</p>
<p>Your Snorlax only has a limited number of uses of this
    powerful move, so you want to minimize the amount of times you
    use it while still defeating every Pokemon. For each use of the
    move, you may choose any column for Snorlax to barrel down
    (including columns with no Pokemon in it). Calculate how many
    times Snorlax must use Pulverizing Pancake to defeat all the
    wild Pokemon.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with one line containing two
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>. This denotes the number of
    columns in the world (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N
    \leq 10^5$</span>) and the number of columns with wild Pokemon
    in them (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq M \leq
    N$</span>).</p>
<p>The second line contains a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1a_2 \ldots a_ N$</span> of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>s and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>s, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> if there are wild Pokemon in
    column <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> otherwise.<br/></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing the minimum number of times
    Snorlax must use Pulverizing Pancake to defeat all wild
    Pokemon.</p>
