<p>The game of Tic Tac Toe is played on an <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-by-<span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> grid (where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is usually but not necessarily
    three). Two players alternate placing symbols on squares of the
    grid. One player places Xes and the other player places Os. The
    player placing Xes always goes first. When the grid contains a
    vertical, horizontal, or diagonal sequence of at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> consecutive squares
    all containing the same symbol, the game ends and the winner is
    the player who placed the last symbol. When all the squares of
    the grid are filled, if neither player has won, the game ends
    in a draw.</p>
<p>Your task is to analyze the state of a Tic Tac Toe board,
    and determine whether the game is still in progress, or if it
    has completed, who won, or if the game ended in a draw. You
    should also detect erroneous states of the Tic Tac Toe board
    that could never occur during an actual game.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, separated by spaces, with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le n \le 1000$</span>.
    The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines of
    input each contain one row of the Tic Tac Toe board. Each of
    these lines contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> characters, and each of these
    characters is either an <tt class="ttfamily">X</tt>, an
    <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt>, or a period (<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>), indicating an empty square.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing the appropriate string
    “<tt class="ttfamily">X WINS</tt>”, “<tt class="ttfamily">O
    WINS</tt>”, or “<tt class="ttfamily">DRAW</tt>” if the game is
    over, the string “<tt class="ttfamily">IN PROGRESS</tt>” if the
    game has not yet finished, or “<tt class="ttfamily">ERROR</tt>”
    if the state of the board could never occur during a game.</p>
