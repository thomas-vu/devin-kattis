<div class="problembody">
<p>Young Mirko threw matches all over the floor of his
    room.</p>
<p>His mom did not like that and ordered him to put all the
    matches in a box. Mirko soon noticed that not all of the
    matches on the floor fit in the box, so he decided to take the
    matches that don’t fit and throw them in the neighbour’s
    garbage, where his mom (hopefully) won’t find them.</p>
<p>Help Mirko determine which of the matches fit in the box his
    mom gave him. A match fits in the box if its entire length can
    lie on the bottom of the box. Mirko examines the matches one by
    one.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 50$</span>), the number of matches on the floor,
    and two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>, the dimensions of the
    box (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq W \leq 100$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq H \leq 100$</span>).</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains a single integer
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> (inclusive), the
    length of one match.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each match, in the order they were given in the input,
    output on a separate line “<tt class="ttfamily">DA</tt>” if the
    match fits in the box or “<tt class="ttfamily">NE</tt>” if it
    does not.</p>
