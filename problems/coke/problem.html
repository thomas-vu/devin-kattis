<div class="problembody">
<p>I often buy Coca-Cola from the vending machine at work.
    Usually I buy several cokes at once, since my working mates
    also likes coke. A coke in the vending machine costs
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> Swedish crowns, and
    the machine accept crowns with the values <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. As soon as I press the coke
    button (after having inserted sufficient amount of money), I
    receive a coke followed by the exchange (if any). The exchange
    is always given in as few coins as possible (this is uniquely
    determined by the coin set used). This procedure is repeated
    until I’ve bought all the cokes I want. Note that I can pick up
    the coin exchange and use those coins when buying further
    cokes.</p>
<p>Now, what is the least number of coins I must insert, given
    the number of cokes I want to buy and the number of coins I
    have of each value? Please help me solve this problem while I
    create some harder problems for you. You may assume that the
    machine won’t run out of coins and that I always have enough
    coins to buy all the cokes I want.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line in the input contains the number of test
    cases (at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>).
    Each case is then given on a line by itself. A test case
    consists of four integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (the number of cokes I want to
    buy), <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_{10}$</span> (the number of coins of value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, respectively). The input limits
    are <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le C \le 150$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n_1 \le 500$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n_5 \le 100$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n_{10} \le 50$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing a single
    integer: the minimum number of coins needed to insert into the
    vending machine.</p>
