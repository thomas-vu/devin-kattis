</div>As a huge fan of the popular collectible card game
    Numinous Wilds: the Elven Reign Chronicles (NWERC), you have a
    large collection of cards which you carefully organise by their
    rarity. One day you notice that someone has touched your
    collection, and that some of the cards are now out of order.
    The most natural suspect, of course, is your little brother
    Billy, who was absolutely <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\%
    $</span> forbidden from playing with your cards. After a few
    minutes of interrogation Billy confesses that he indeed took a
    few consecutive cards from the middle of the stack, but he
    swears that he put them back in exactly the same order as they
    were. You suspect that Billy, being so young, may have simply
    mistakenly reversed the order of the cards that he took. Now
    you want to check your theory and decide if you can find the
    batch of cards that Billy took to play with.
    <p>Is it possible to restore the order of the cards into
    non-decreasing order of their rarity by reversing just one
    contiguous batch of cards?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 10^6$</span>), the number of
        cards in your collection.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_1, \ldots , v_ n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le v_{i} \le 10^9$</span> for all
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>), the current
        order of the cards’ rarity values.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the cards can be sorted by reversing exactly one
    contiguous subsequence of the list, then output the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-based start and end
    indices of such a subsequence. Otherwise, output “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”. If there are multiple valid
    solutions you may output any one of them.</p>
