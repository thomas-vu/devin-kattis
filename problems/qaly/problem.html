<p>The Quality-Adjusted Life-Year (QALY) is a way to measure a
    person’s quality of life that includes both the quality and the
    quantity of life lived.</p>
<p>The quality of life lived can be quantified as a number
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. If someone is living
    with perfect health, the quality of life is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. If someone is dead, then the
    quality of life is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.
    The quality of life may increase or decrease due to medical
    treatements, sickness, etc.</p>
<p>The QALY for each period in which the quality of life is
    constant is simply the product of the quality of life and the
    length of the period (in years). We wish to know the amount of
    QALY accumulated by a person at the time of death, given the
    complete history of this person.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 100$</span>), which is the
    number of periods of constant quality of life during the
    person’s lifetime.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    describe the periods of life. Each of these lines contains two
    real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; q \leq 1$</span>), which is the
    quality of life in this period, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; y \leq 100$</span>), which is the
    number of years in this period. All real numbers will be
    specified to exactly one decimal place.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the QALY accumulated by the person. Your answer will
    be considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span>.</p>
