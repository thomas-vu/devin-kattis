<div class="problembody">
<p>Euler’s number (you may know it better as just <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span>) has a special place in
    mathematics. You may have encountered <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> in calculus or economics (for
    computing compound interest), or perhaps as the base of the
    natural logarithm, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ln
    {x}$</span>, on your calculator.</p>
<p>While <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> can be
    calculated as a limit, there is a good approximation that can
    be made using discrete mathematics. The formula for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> is:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{align*} e &amp; = \displaystyle \sum
    _{i=0}^ n\dfrac {1}{i!}\\ &amp; = \dfrac {1}{0!} +\dfrac
    {1}{1!} +\dfrac {1}{2!}+\dfrac {1}{3!}+\dfrac {1}{4!} + \cdots
    \\ \end{align*}</span>
<p>Note that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0! = 1$</span>. Now
    as <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> approaches
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\infty $</span>, the series
    converges to <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span>. When
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is any positive
    constant, the formula serves as an approximation of the actual
    value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span>. (For
    example, at <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=10$</span> the
    approximation is already accurate to <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> decimals.)</p>
<p>You will be given a single input, a value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, and your job is to compute the
    approximation of <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> for
    that value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>A single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>,
    ranging from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single real number – the approximation of <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> computed by the formula with the
    given <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. All output must
    be accurate to an absolute or relative error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-12}$</span>.</p>
