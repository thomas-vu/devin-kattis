<div class="problembody">
<p>Given a directed acyclic graph, output one of its longest
    paths.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le V \le 100\, 000$</span>), the number of vertices in the
    graph, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le E \le 200\, 000$</span>),
    the number of edges.</p>
<p>Next, <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> lines follow
    containing the edges. An edge is given by two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a \neq b \le V$</span>,
    meaning that the edge points from vertex <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> to vertex <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. There may be multiple edges
    between the same pair of vertices. It is guaranteed that there
    is no cycle in the graph.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>First, output the number of vertices on a longest path.
    Then, output one line with the numbers of those vertices in the
    order in which they appear on the path. The first vertex should
    be the one starting the path, i.e. it should have an outgoing
    edge to the second vertex you output (if there is one).</p>
