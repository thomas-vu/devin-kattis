<div class="problembody">
<p>You have an assortment of circular gears with varying
    numbers and sizes of teeth. You also have a motor that spins at
    one revolution per second, as well as an unlimited number of
    (identical, arbitrarily long) axles. The motor and all gears
    fit the axles, and everything attached to a particular axle
    rotates at the same angular speed. Two gears with the same size
    teeth can be enmeshed with each other. Gears with different
    size teeth cannot be enmeshed with each other (though they can
    be placed on the same axle).</p>

</center>
<p>You can arrange the gears and axles in any order. What is
    the maximum rate at which the last gear/axle in sequence spins
    that you can achieve? Because this may be large, output the
    <em>natural log</em> of the value.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n \le 10^5$</span>) denoting the
    number of gears.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le s \le 10^5$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \le c \le 10^5$</span>), one for each gear in your collection,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is the size of
    the teeth of the gear and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is the count of the number of
    teeth.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line with a single number equal to the
    <em>natural log</em> of the maximum angular speed you can
    achieve with your motor and axles and gears in your collection.
    This output will be considered correct if it is within an
    absolute or relative error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> .</p>
