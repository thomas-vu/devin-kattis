<div class="problembody">
<p>In a nearby village, the postman, milkman and garbage man
    face the same problem morning after morning: house 18. House 18
    is guarded by two dogs that often cause problems. What they
    don’t know is that the dogs’ behaviour is completely
    predictable.</p>
<p>When the day starts, one dog is aggressive for <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> minutes and is then calm for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> minutes. Similarly,
    the other dog is aggressive for <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> minutes, then calm for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> minutes. Both dogs
    repeat their behaviours indefinitely, starting a new aggressive
    period after the calm period, then another calm period etc.</p>
<p>Given the arrival times of the postman, milkman and garbage
    man, determine how many dogs (none, one or both) attack each of
    them.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>.</p>
<p>The second line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span>, the minute in the day during
    which the postman, milkman and garbage man arrive at house 18.
    For example, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is 3,
    it should be interpreted as "the postman arrived sometime
    during the third minute in the day".</p>
<p>All numbers in the input will be between 1 and 999.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output should consist of three lines; each containing
    ’both’, ’one’ or ’none’, depending on how many dogs attack each
    of our heroes.</p>
