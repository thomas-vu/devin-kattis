<p>The goal of this program is to find all unique ways to
    represent a given even number as the sum of two prime numbers.
    A prime number is an integer greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> that is evenly divisible by only
    itself and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. The first
    few prime numbers are <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>, …. The German mathematician
    Christian Goldbach (1690-1764) conjectured that every even
    number greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    can be represented by the sum of two prime numbers. (This
    conjecture has never been proved nor has a counterexample ever
    been found. As such, you may assume it is true for the cases
    considered in this problem.) There may be several ways to
    represent a given even number by the sum of primes. For
    example, the even number <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span> may be represented as
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 + 23$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$7 + 19$</span>, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$13 + 13$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 100$</span>) indicating the number of cases. The
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    contain a test case of a single even number <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$4
    \leq x \leq 32\, 000$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>,
    give the number of unique ways that <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> can be represented as a sum of two
    primes. Then list the sums (one sum per line) in increasing
    order of the first addend. The first addend must always be less
    than or equal to the second to avoid duplicates. Print a blank
    line after each test case.</p>
