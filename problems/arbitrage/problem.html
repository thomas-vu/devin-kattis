<p>If you are going to travel to the World Finals, you cannot
    rely on Czech Crowns. You would have to exchange your money for
    various foreign currencies. This problem deals with multiple
    currencies and their exchange rates. Your task is to verify
    that some set of exchange rates is safe, namely detect a
    possibility of so-called arbitrage.</p>
<p>An <em>arbitrage</em> is a risk-free combination of buy and
    sell operations that gains profit from imbalance in market
    prices. The prices may apply to various things, typically stock
    exchange but also currencies.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several test cases. Each case begins
    with a line containing one positive integer number <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq C\leq 200$</span>, the number of currencies.</p>
<p>The second line of each test case contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> currency codes separated by a
    space. Each code is composed of 3 uppercase letters and all
    codes in one test case are different.</p>
<p>The third line contains one integer number <span class="tex2jax_process">$R, 0\leq R \leq C\cdot (C-1)$</span>, the
    number of exchange rates available. Each of the following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> lines contains one
    exchange rate in the following format: first currency code,
    space, second currency code, space, integer number <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span>, colon (’<tt class="tt">:</tt>’), and integer number <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span>. The meaning is as follows: If
    you pay <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> units of
    the first currency, you will get <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span> units of the second currency.
    You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq A_ i,
    B_ i\leq 100$</span> and that the two currencies are
    different.</p>
<p>The last test case is followed by a line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$C=0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print one line of output. If there
    exists any possible sequence of currency exchange operations
    that would result in a profit, the line should contain the word
    "<tt class="tt">Arbitrage</tt>". Otherwise, simply print
    "<tt class="tt">Ok</tt>".</p>
<p>The word <em>profit</em> in this case means that you start
    with any amount of any currency and after performing any number
    of exchanges you will have strictly higher amount of the same
    currency.</p>
