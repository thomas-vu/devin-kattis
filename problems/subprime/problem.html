<p>There is an open math problem: Is every non-negative integer
    a substring of at least one prime number when expressed in base
    ten?</p>
<p>A positive integer is a prime number if it is greater than
    one and not a product of two smaller positive integers. Integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is a substring of
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> if it is equal
    to an integer derived from <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> by deleting zero or more
    consecutive digits of the most and least significant digits of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. For example,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$123$</span> is a substring of:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\underline{123},
    56\underline{123}, \underline{123}789, 501823\underline{123}65,
    4\underline{123}7912\underline{123}$</span>.</p>
<p>Given two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> along with an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, you are to
    check how many primes between the <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>th smallest prime and the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>th smallest prime (both
    ends are inclusive) contain a substring that equals
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>. We are interested in
    substrings that may include significant leading zeroes, and
    thus <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> may have leading
    zeroes. A prime shall be counted only once even if the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> occurs more than once
    as its substring.</p>
<p>For example, consider <span class="tex2jax_process">$l = 1,
    h = 10$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p =
    9$</span>. This is a search from the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>st smallest prime (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>) to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>th smallest prime (<span class="tex2jax_process">$29$</span>) for any prime containing the
    substring “<span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>”. There are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> such primes:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\underline{9}$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\underline{9}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input has two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq l \leq h \leq 10^5$</span>). The second line has a
    sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> digits giving the
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, which may be
    zero or have significant leading zeroes.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the count of prime numbers in the given range that
    contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> as a
    substring.</p>
