<div class="problembody">
<p>This problem is simple. Just search the input for
    hexadecimal numbers, and print any numbers you find in both
    hexadecimal and decimal format.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input is a sequence of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> text lines, ending at end of
    file. Each line has at most 100 characters, and may contain one
    or more hexadecimal numbers. No hexadecimal number spans
    multiple lines. A hexidecimal number begins with ‘<tt class="tt">0x</tt>’ or ‘<tt class="tt">0X</tt>’ (that’s a number zero
    followed by a letter x), followed by a string of hexadecimal
    digits (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, a–f, or A–F). A hexadecimal
    number should be as long as possible, but no hexadecimal number
    in the input is greater than <tt class="tt">0xffffffff</tt>. No
    two hexadecimal numbers are adjacent on any line.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each hexadecimal number (in the order they appear in the
    input), print a line containing the hexadecimal number as it
    appeared in the input and its non-negative decimal
    equivalent.</p>
