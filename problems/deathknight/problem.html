<p>There once was a champion of <em>WoW</em><br/>
<em>Arthasdk</em> the name he was bestowed<br/>
    He <em>Death Gripped</em> you to his side<br/>
    His <em>Chains of Ice</em> stopped your stride<br/>
    And <em>Obliterates</em> made you say “OWW!”<br/></p>
<p>But one day our hero got puzzled<br/>
    His <em>Death Grip</em> totally fizzled<br/>
    In his darkest despair<br/>
    He could barely hear<br/>
    “OMG NOOB u <em>Chains of Iced</em> than u <em>Death
    Gripped</em>”<br/></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>You are given a recording of the abilities our hero used in
    his battles.</p>
<p>The first line of input will contain a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100$</span>), the number of
    battles our hero played.</p>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    each with a sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_
    i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k_ i \leq
    1000$</span>) characters, each of which are either ’C’, ’D’ or
    ’O’. These denote the sequence of abilities used by our hero in
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th battle. ’C’ is
    <em>Chains of Ice</em>, ’D’ is <em>Death Grip</em> and ’O’ is
    <em>Obliterate</em>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of battles our hero won, assuming he won
    each battle where he did not use <em>Chains of Ice</em>
    immediately followed by <em>Death Grip</em>.</p>
