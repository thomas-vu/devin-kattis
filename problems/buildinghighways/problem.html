<div class="problembody">
<p>The country of Singanesia consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> cities, numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. From a recent survey, each city
    is assigned a level which denote how problematic it is. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th city have a
    problematic level of <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_
    i$</span>. To improve the welfare, recently there is a plan to
    build intercities highways. As problematic cities tend to
    hinder the development of the highway, the government decided
    to use the problematic level to estimate how difficult it is to
    build a highway between two cities. The difficulty level of
    building a highway connecting <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th city and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th city is <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i+A_ j$</span>. Now, the government plan
    for the intercities highways goes like the following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>They will build several highways such that from any
        city, someone can go to any other cities using the built
        highways</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They will minimize the sum of the difficulty level of
        building the intercities highways</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As the leader for this development plan, your task is to
    find the minimum sum of the difficulty level to build the
    intercities highways.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 200\, 000$</span>).</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq A_ i \leq 1\, 000\, 000$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum sum of the difficulty level to build the
    highways.</p>
<h2>Subtasks</h2>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>(<b class="bfseries"><span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> Points</b>): <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \leq 1\, 000$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(<b class="bfseries"><span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> Points</b>): All <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> have the same value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(<b class="bfseries"><span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span> Points</b>): No additional
        constraints.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>Below is the explanation for the first sample. Each line
    denotes the difficulty of building the highway. The red lines
    denote one possible intercities highways plan with the minimum
    sum of the difficulty level.</p>
