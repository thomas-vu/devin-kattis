<p>Anthony is participating in a programming contest today!
    He’s excellent at algorithms; he can design and implement the
    solution to even the hardest problems in the programming
    contest in minutes. Unfortunately, parsing inputs is his
    greatest weakness. Specifically, he really struggles with
    problems which require him to convert strings to lowercase.
    When Anthony is given a string, he only converts the first
    character of the string to lowercase.</p>
<p>You somehow gained access to the test data for every problem
    in today’s contest. There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> problems in the contest, and every
    problem in the contest has exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases. Each test case
    consists of a single string with only English characters, and
    every problem requires converting the entire string to
    lowercase as a preprocessing step.</p>
<p>As Anthony is a master problem solver, you know that he is
    able to design and implement the algorithm for every problem
    within the contest’s time constraint. Specifically, Anthony’s
    program will pass a test case <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> if and only if every character in
    the string corresponding to <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> is converted to lowercase. Now you
    wonder: how many problems will he solve in the contest? Note
    that a problem is considered solved if all test cases
    passed.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq P,T\leq 50$</span>.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$PT$</span> lines
    contain the test data for all the problems in the contest.</p>
<p>Every line contains exactly one nonempty string composed of
    only English characters. Test cases are grouped by problems, so
    the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines
    represent all the test cases for problem <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines represent all the test cases
    for problem <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and so
    on. It is guaranteed that the total number of characters in the
    test cases does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$50\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer denoting the number of problems
    Anthony will solve during the contest.</p>
