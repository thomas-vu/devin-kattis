<p>Little Ivica solves crossword puzzles every day. In case you
    haven’t seen one, a crossword puzzle starts on a grid of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R \times C$</span> squares, each
    of which is either empty or blocked. The player’s task is to
    write words in consecutive empty squares vertically (top down)
    or horizontally (left to right).</p>
<p>Ivica’s sister has a strange habit of looking at crosswords
    Ivica has finished solving, and finding the <b class="bfseries">lexicographically smallest word</b> in it. She only
    considers words at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> characters long.</p>
<p>Write a program that, given a crossword puzzle, finds that
    word.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le R, C \le 20$</span>), the number of rows and columns in the
    crosswords.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> lines contains a string of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> characters. Each of
    those characters is either a lowercase letter of the English
    alphabet, or the character ‘<tt class="ttfamily">#</tt>’
    representing a blocked square.</p>
<p>The input will be such that a solution will always
    exist.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the lexicographically smallest word in the
    crossword.</p>
