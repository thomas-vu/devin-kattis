<div class="problembody">
<p>It is so difficult to keep everything in order! For this
    problem, you have two lists of numbers, each list having length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Each number in one
    list has a corresponding number in the other list. The
    correspondence is that if both lists were in sorted and placed
    side by side, each pair of numbers would correspond. For
    example, in the lists <span class="tex2jax_process">$(48,10,97)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(7,46,20)$</span>, the corresponding numbers
    are <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$48$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$97$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$46$</span>.</p>
<p>You want to keep the lists synchronized, but you know that
    the second list has gotten out of order. So you want to put it
    in the same order as the first list, according to the
    correspondences.</p>
<p>For example, given the two lists above, the second list
    should be reordered as <span class="tex2jax_process">$(20,7,46)$</span> to be in order with the
    first list.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists at most 100 test cases. Each test case begins
    with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq
    5\, 000$</span>, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$2n$</span> lines. The first <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines are the first list (which is
    in a fixed order), and the second <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines are from the second list
    (which may be out of sync with the first list). All integers
    given in the lists are in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-10\, 000, 10\, 000]$</span>. Input ends
    when <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = 0$</span>. No list
    contains duplicates.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print out the second list so that it has
    the same ordering as the first list. Print a blank line between
    lists.</p>
