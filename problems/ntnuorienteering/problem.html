<p>After the unification of NTNU and HiNT, the now all-powerful
    NTNU has a lot of campuses at its disposal. You, a student of
    Computer Science, are facing the problem of having to attend
    lectures at several campuses; campuses that are far away from
    each other.</p>
<p>You’re given a handy time schedule with all your lectures
    listed for a given day, and, using the map app on your phone,
    you write down the time it takes on the bus between each
    campus. You notice that it won’t always be possible to attend
    every lecture due to overlapping lectures and travel times
    between campuses. Luckily, you have an “AtB GOLD CARD” that
    grants you unlimited bus travel at no cost.</p>
<p>Given the lecture time schedules for a day and the bus
    travel times between each campus, what is the highest number of
    lectures that you can attend from start to finish for a given
    day? You may choose to start your day at any campus (you are an
    <em>extremely</em> early riser).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the number of test
    cases.<br/>
    The first line of each test case is an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, denoting the number of
    campuses.<br/>
    The second line contains another integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>, denoting the number of lectures
    you have this day.</p>
<p>This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{1}{2} \times C \times (C-1)$</span>
    (combinations of campuses) lines, each containing 3 integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_{i, j}$</span> separated by spaces, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_{i, j}$</span> describes the
    time the bus route between campus <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and campus <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> takes in microseconds. Campus ids
    start at index <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and end
    at index <span class="tex2jax_process">$C-1$</span>. Each pair
    of campuses will be listed exactly once, and you can assume
    that the same bus goes both ways, so that the time on the bus
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> is equal to the time on the bus
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. Traveling between lecture rooms
    within the same campus takes no time.</p>
<p>Then follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> lines
    of lecture durations for this day. Each line contains 3
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ l$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ l$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$E_ l$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ L$</span> gives the index of the campus
    the lecture is held at, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_
    l$</span> is the absolute start time of the lecture in
    microseconds and <span class="tex2jax_process">$E_ l$</span> is
    the end time of the lecture in microseconds. You can start
    traveling to the next lecture the same microsecond as the
    lecture ends.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq
        20$</span></p>

<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq C_ l &lt;
