<p>Most people have heard of Julius Caesar, a Roman dictator
    who lived in the first century BC and who was famous, amongst
    other things, for defeating enemies by pitting them against
    each other, thereby preventing them from uniting against him, a
    strategy known as “Divide and Conquer”. A lesser known fact is
    that Julius Caesar had a grandfather named Julius Senior, an
    old man who has miraculously lived to this day and who
    currently resides in an old age home in the town of
    Quackville.</p>
<p>Life in the old age home is mostly dull, but every Friday,
    Julius Senior and his compatriots have a rousing game of Bingo!
    The stakes are especially high, for not only does the victor
    gain the much-coveted title of “Bingo Champion”, but there is
    also a reward of several sour candies. Julius Senior finds
    Bingo fun, but after never having won even once over all these
    millennia, the militaristic tendencies present in his family
    have begun to manifest themselves, and he has hatched a plot to
    gain the sour candies by illegitimate means. For his plan, he
    will need to make use of some divisibility hacks.</p>
<p>A divisibility hack is a mental math trick that can be used
    to easily decide which positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> are multiples of a given positive
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>. As well as
    depending on the divisor <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, a specific divisibility hack is
    determined by two other integer parameters, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b &gt; 1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m &gt; 0$</span>. The parameters
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> are used to define a reduction
    function <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_{b,m}(n)$</span> that
    maps positive integers to (usually smaller) integers. For a
    given positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, if</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ n = a_ kb^ k + a_{k - 1}b^{k - 1} + \ldots
    + a_1b^1 + a_0b^0 \]</span>
<p>is the <span class="mbox" style="width:">base-<span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span></span> expansion of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_{b,m}(n)$</span> is defined to
    be</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{align*} &amp; +
    (a_{m - 1} b^{m - 1} + a_{m - 2} b^{m - 2} + \ldots + a_1 b^1 +
    a_0 b^0)\\ &amp; \quad - (a_{2m - 1} b^{m - 1} + a_{2m - 2}
    b^{m - 2} + \ldots + a_{m+1} b^1 + a_ m b^0)\\ &amp; \quad
    \quad + (a_{3m-1} b^{m - 1} + a_{3m-2} b^{m - 2} + \ldots +
    a_{2m+1} b^1 + a_{2m} b^0) \\ &amp; \quad \quad \quad -
    (a_{4m-1} b^{m - 1} + a_{4m-2} b^{m - 2} + \ldots + a_{3m+1}
    b^1 + a_{3m} b^0) \\ &amp; \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad
    \quad \vdots \end{align*}</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ j = 0$</span>
    whenever <span class="tex2jax_process">$j &gt; k$</span>. In
    other words, the reduction function is an alternating sum of
    terms, each of which is formed using <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> consecutive <span class="mbox" style="width:">base-<span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span></span> digits of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, starting with the least
    significant digit. We say that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(b,d,m)$</span> divisibility hack is
    <em>valid</em> if for all positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_{b,m}(n)$</span> is divisible by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> if and only if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is divisible by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>. Thus, if we have a
    large integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> to
    check for divisibility by <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, we can simply apply the reduction
    function to get a new smaller integer that we can instead test
    for divisibility by <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>.</p>
<p>For example, it turns out that <span class="tex2jax_process">$(10,11,1)$</span> is a valid divisibility
    hack. We can therefore determine that <span class="tex2jax_process">$123\, 456\, 789$</span> is not a multiple of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>, since <span class="tex2jax_process">$9 - 8 + 7 - 6 + 5 - 4 + 3 - 2 + 1 =
    5$</span> is not a multiple of <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>. Also, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(10,7,3)$</span> is a valid divisibility
    hack, so we can use this to see that <span class="tex2jax_process">$42\, 321\, 999\, 020$</span> is a multiple
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>, since <span class="tex2jax_process">$20 - 999 + 321 - 42 = -700$</span> is a
    multiple of <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>.</p>
<p>Julius Senior’s nefarious scheme is to disseminate knowledge
    of some specific divisibility hacks to a select group of senior
    citizens, and to train them to go rabid when he says the
    trigger word “MAPS” (Multiples Are Pretty Sick), using their
    divisibility hacks to scream facts about integers dividing or
    not dividing other integers at each other. His plan is to do
    this in the middle of their next Bingo tournament, whereupon he
    can take advantage of the ensuing chaos to purloin the sour
    candies without anyone noticing.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Julius Senior’s math skills aren’t what they
    used to be, so he is having a hard time coming up with
    divisibility hacks. In fact, when he randomly chooses integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, he can’t even figure out if there
    <em>exists</em> a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> such that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(b,d,m)$</span> divisibility hack is valid.
    Can you write a program to help him determine when this is the
    case?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two space-separated integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, satisfying the bounds
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 &lt; b,d &lt; 2^{63}$</span>.
    It is guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>
    is a prime number.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If there exists a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> such that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(b,d,m)$</span> divisibility hack is valid,
    output “<tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt>”. Otherwise, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">no</tt>”.</p>
