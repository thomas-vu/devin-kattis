<p>The urban legend goes that if you go to the Google homepage
    and search for "Google", the universe will implode. We have a
    secret to share... It is true! Please don’t try it, or tell
    anyone. All right, maybe not. We are just kidding.</p>
<p>The same is not true for a universe far far away. In that
    universe, if you search on any search engine for that search
    engine’s name, the universe does implode!</p>
<p>To combat this, people came up with an interesting solution.
    All queries are pooled together. They are passed to a central
    system that decides which query goes to which search engine.
    The central system sends a series of queries to one search
    engine, and can switch to another at any time. Queries must be
    processed in the order they’re received. The central system
    must never send a query to a search engine whose name matches
    the query. In order to reduce costs, the number of switches
    should be minimized.</p>
<p>Your task is to tell us how many times the central system
    will have to switch between search engines, assuming that we
    program it optimally.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input file contains the number of
    cases, <span class="tex2jax_process">$T\leq 20$</span>.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases follow.</p>
<p>Each case starts with the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> – the number of search engines.
    The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> lines each
    contain the name of a search engine. Each search engine name is
    no more than one hundred characters long and contains only
    uppercase letters, lowercase letters, spaces, and numbers.
    There will not be two search engines with the same name.</p>
<p>The following line contains a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> – the number of incoming queries.
    The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines will
    each contain a query. Each query will be the name of a search
    engine in the case.</p>
<p>You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq
    S\leq 100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq
    Q\leq 1\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input case, you should output:</p>
<pre>
Case #X: Y
</pre>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is the number
    of the test case and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>
    is the number of search engine switches.</p>
<p>Do not count the initial choice of a search engine as a
    switch.</p>
