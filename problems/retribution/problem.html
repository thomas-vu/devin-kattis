<p>The coaches in a certain regional are fed up with the
    judges. During the last contest over <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span>% of the teams failed to solve a
    single problem—in fact, even half the judges found the problems
    too hard to solve. So the coaches have decided to tar and
    feather the judges. They know the locations of all the judges
    as well as the locations of tar repositories and feather
    storehouses. They would like to assign one repository and one
    storehouse to each judge so as to minimize the total distances
    involved. But this is a hard problem and the coaches don’t have
    time to solve it (the judges are evil but not stupid—they have
    a sense of the unrest they’ve fomented and are getting ready to
    leave town). So instead they’ve decided to use a greedy
    solution. They’ll look for the smallest distance between any
    tar repository and any judge location and assign that
    repository to that judge. Then they’ll repeat the process with
    the remaining repositories and judges until all the judges have
    a repository assigned to them. After they’re finished with the
    tar assignments they’ll do the same with the feather
    storehouses and the judges. Your job is to determine the total
    distances between repositories and storehouses and their
    assigned judges.</p>
<p>All judges, tar repositories and feather storehouses are
    numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \ldots $</span>.
    In case of any ties, always assign a repository/storehouse to
    the lowest numbered judge first. If there is still a tie, use
    the lowest numbered repository/storehouse.</p>
<p>Better hurry up—an unmarked van has just been spotted
    pulling up behind the judges’ room.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line containing three positive integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq m, p \leq 1\, 000$</span>), representing the number
    of judges, tar repositories and feather storehouses,
    respectively. Following this are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each containing two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$|x|, |y| \leq 10\, 000$</span>) specifying
    the locations of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    judges, starting with judge <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> similar lines specifying the
    locations of the tar repositories (starting with repository
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> lines specifying the locations of
    the feather storehouses (starting with storehouse <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the the sum of all distances between judges and their
    assigned tar repositories and feather storehouses, using the
    greedy method described above. Your answer should have an
    absolute or relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
