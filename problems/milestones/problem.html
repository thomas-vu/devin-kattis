<p>Driving through the Irish countryside, one frequently sees
    enigmatic small grey stones sitting by the wayside, spaced
    about a kilometre and a half apart. As it turns out, these
    stones once had a purpose: they were <em>milestones</em>,
    intended to demarcate this venerable unit of measurement.</p>
<p>Being so old and, crucially, collectible by magpies and
    larger scamps alike, not all of these stones have remained.</p>
<p>Passing by some more of these tattered markers at a constant
    but unknown speed, you may still be able to gain some
    information from their placements. For example, since you
    started counting you have passed exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> remaining stones; how fast could
    you have been driving?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing two positive integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$ 2 \leq M \leq N \leq 10^3 $</span>):
        the number of consecutive stones you noticed and the total
        number of stones along the road respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> distinct non-negative integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_{1..M}$</span> in
        ascending order—the times at which you passed stones in
        hours (<span class="tex2jax_process">$ 0 \leq T_ i \leq
        10^{15} $</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> distinct non-negative integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_{1..N}$</span> in
        ascending order—the distances along the road of each
        milestone (<span class="tex2jax_process">$ 0 \leq X_ i \leq
        10^{15} $</span>) in miles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two lines:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>First, the number of distinct possible speeds at which
        the car could have been travelling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Second, a space-separated list of all of the possible
        distances between the first milestone you saw and the
        second milestone you saw, in increasing order.</p>
</li>
