<div class="problembody">
<p>One of your friends desperately needs your help. He is
    working with a secret agency and doing some encoding stuff. As
    the mission is confidential he does not tell you much about
    that, he just wants you to help him with a special property of
    a number. This property can be expressed as a function
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(n)$</span> for a positive
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. It is defined
    as</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ f(n)=\sum _{\substack
    {1\leq p\leq q\leq n\\ \mathrm{lcm}(p,q)=n}}(p+q) \]</span>
<p>In other words, he needs the sum of all possible pairs whose
    least common multiple is <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (the least common multiple (LCM)
    of two numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> is the lowest positive
    integer which can be perfectly divided by both <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>). For example, there are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> different pairs having
    their LCM equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> as
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 6)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 6)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 3)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3, 6)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(6, 6)$</span>. So <span class="tex2jax_process">$f (6)$</span> is calculated
    as</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ f (6) = (1 + 6) + (2 +
    6) + (2 + 3) + (3 + 6) + (6 + 6) = 7 + 8 + 5 + 9 + 12 = 41.
    \]</span>
<p>Your friend knows you are good at solving this kind of
    problems, so he asked you to lend a hand. He also does not want
    to disturb you much, so to assist you he has factorized the
    number. He thinks it may help you.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input will contain the number of test
    cases <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 10$</span>). After that there will be
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases.</p>
<p>Each of the test cases will start with a positive number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$C \leq 15$</span>) denoting the number of
    prime factors of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Then
    there will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> lines
    each containing two numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>
    denoting the prime factor and its power (<span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span> is a prime between <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>) and (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a_ i \leq 50$</span>). All the primes
    for an input case will be distinct.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each of the test cases produce one line of output
    denoting the case number and <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(n)$</span> modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 007$</span>. See the output
    for sample input for exact formatting.</p>
