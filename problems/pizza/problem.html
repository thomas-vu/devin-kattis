<p>Your Irish pizza and kebab restaurant is doing very well.
    Not only is the restaurant full almost every night, but there
    are also an ever increasing number of deliveries to be made,
    all over town. To meet this demand, you realize that it will be
    necessary to separate the delivery service from the restaurant.
    A new large kitchen, only for baking pizzas and being a base
    for deliveries, has to be established somewhere in town.</p>
<p>The main cost in the delivery service is not the making of
    the pizza itself, but the time it takes to deliver it. To
    minimize this, you need to carefully plan the location of the
    new kitchen. To your help you have a database of all last
    year’s deliveries. For each location in the city, you know how
    many deliveries were made there last year. The kitchen location
    will be chosen based on the assumption that the pattern of
    demand will be the same in the future.</p>
<p>Your city has a typical suburban layout – an orthogonal grid
    of equal-size square blocks. All places of interest (delivery
    points and the kitchen) are considered to be located at street
    crossings. The distance between two street crossings is the
    Manhattan distance, i.e., the number of blocks you have to
    drive vertically, plus the number of blocks you have to drive
    horizontally. The total cost for a delivery point is its
    Manhattan distance from the kitchen, times the number of
    deliveries to the point. Note that we are only counting the
    distance <em>from</em> the kitchen <em>to</em> the delivery
    point. Even though we always drive directly back to the kitchen
    after a delivery is made, this (equal) distance is not included
    in the cost measure.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line, there is a number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 20$</span>, indicating the
    number of test cases. Each test case begins with a line with
    two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x \leq
    100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq y \leq
    100$</span>, indicating the size of the two-dimensional street
    grid. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>
    lines, each with <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq d \leq
    1000$</span>, indicating the number of deliveries made to each
    street crossing last year.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the least possible total delivery
    cost (the sum of all delivery costs last year), assuming that
    the kitchen was located optimally. There should be one line for
    each test case, with an integer indicating the cost, followed
    by a single space and the word “<tt>blocks</tt>”.</p>
