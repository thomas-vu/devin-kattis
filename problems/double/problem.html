<div class="problembody">
<p>Take a deck of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    unique cards. Deal the entire deck out to <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> players in the usual way: the top
    card to player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, the
    next to player <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k^{th}$</span> to player
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(k+1)^{st}$</span> to player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and so on. Then pick up the cards
    – place player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>’s cards
    on top, then player <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>,
    and so on, so that player <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>’s cards are on the bottom. Each
    player’s cards are in reverse order – the last card that they
    were dealt is on the top, and the first on the bottom.</p>
<p>How many times, including the first, must this process be
    repeated before the deck is back in its original order?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There will be up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$32\,
    000$</span> test cases in the input. Each case will consist of
    a single line with two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 800$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le k
    \le 800$</span>). The input will end with a line with two
    0s.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case in the input, print a single integer,
    indicating the number of deals required to return the deck to
    its original order. Output each integer on its own line, with
    no extra spaces, and no blank lines between answers. All
    possible inputs yield answers which will fit in a signed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$64$</span>-bit integer.</p>
