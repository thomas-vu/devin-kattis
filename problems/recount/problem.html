</div>The recent schoolboard elections were hotly contested: a
    proposal to swap school start times for elementary and high
    school students, a controversial new dress code proposal that
    bans athletic clothes in school, and a proposal to raise
    real-estate taxes to pay for a new football practice facility,
    and the list goes on and on. It is now hours after the polls
    have closed and a winner has yet to emerge!

    <p>In their desperation, the election officials turn to you and
    ask you to write a program to count the vote!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case, which is a list of
    votes cast. Each line in the input contains the name of a
    candidate for whom a vote was cast. A name may consist of
    multiple words, separated by spaces. Words contain letters or
    hyphens, but no other punctuation characters. There will be at
    least <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> votes on the
    list. The list of votes ends with a single line containing the
    characters <tt class="ttfamily">***</tt>. This line should not
    be counted. There can be up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> valid votes.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If a candidate obtained a simple or absolute majority of all
    votes cast (that is, more than any other candidate), output the
    name of this candidate! If no candidate obtained a simple
    majority, output: “<tt class="ttfamily">Runoff!</tt>” (don’t
    forget to include the exclamation mark!)</p>
