</div>Our hero, Jim, is about to embark on his grand adventure.
    On his way, he’ll encounter three different types of objects:
    money, incense, and gems. When he encounters an object, he will
    always put it into his backpack. Unfortunately, he’ll also
    encounter villains along the way. More specifically, the Banker
    (who will demand money), the Trader (who demand incense), and
    the Jeweler (who will demand, of course, jewels). Jim must give
    each villain one of the kind of item they demand as he
    encounters them, or else he fails and his adventure is over.
    Unfortunately, Jim’s backpack isn’t very ergonomic and so he
    can only reach the item he most recently put in it. In other
    words, the items below are inaccessible until he’s given away
    the one on top. Jim would also like arrive at his destination
    with no extra items in his bag. If he does have items at the
    end, he’ll consider his adventure a failure.
    <p>We’d like to know if Jim will be able to complete his
    adventure before he even starts!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 5$</span>, the number of adventures. Each of the next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contains a
    single string <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, a
    sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ \$ , *, |, t, j,
    b, .\} $</span>. An example of this adventure string is:</p>
<pre>
....$...$...*..*...|...t...j..j...b..b...
</pre>
<p>where,</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">$</tt> represents Money</p>

</ul>
<p>and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq |a| \leq
    100$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$|a|$</span> is
    the length of string <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>.
