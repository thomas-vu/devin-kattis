<p>While the players are resting between sets, the station puts
    on tedious commercials. Zvonko fires up the teletext feature on
    his TV set and is reviewing the latest scores and standings in
    the football league. Always sharp, he has come up with a new
    mathematical game.</p>
<p>The standings table contains five statistics for each team:
    the total number of games played, how many of those games the
    team won, drew and lost, and points earned. A team earns 3
    points for every win and 1 point for every draw.</p>
<p>Zvonko noticed that the values of some fields can be
    determined from the others. Write a program that takes in a
    table in which the values of some fields are unknown, and fills
    in the missing fields.</p>
<p>The data for different teams is not related. For example, it
    is possible that the table says all teams have won all their
    games (although that is not possible in a real league).</p>
<p>Each team will have played at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> games (even though that can be
    one of the missing fields).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq N \leq 1000)$</span>, the number of teams in the
    league.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains the <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> fields for one team separated by
    single spaces, containing the <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> pieces of data as described in the
    problem statement. Each field contains an integer (at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>), or the character
    ‘<tt>?</tt>’ (question mark) if the value is not known.</p>
<p>The input will be consistent and there will be a unique way
    to determine the values of the missing fields.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the table with the missing fields filled in.</p>
