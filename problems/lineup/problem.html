<div class="problembody">
<p>An eccentric coach asks players on the team to line up
    alphabetically at the start of practice. The coach does not
    tell the players whether they need to line up in increasing or
    decreasing order, so they guess. If they guess wrong, the coach
    makes them run laps before practice. Given a list of names, you
    are to determine if the list is in increasing alphabetical
    order, decreasing alphabetical order or neither.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line
    will contain the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> of people on the team
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 20$</span>).
    Following that are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines, each containing the name of one person. A name will be
    at least two characters and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> characters in length and
    will consist only of capital letters, and with no white spaces
    (sorry BILLY BOB and MARY JOE). Duplicates names will
    not be allowed on a team.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single word: <span class="mbox" style="width:"><tt class="ttfamily">INCREASING</tt></span> if the list
    is in increasing alphabetical order, <span class="mbox" style="width:"><tt class="ttfamily">DECREASING</tt></span> if it
    is in decreasing alphabetical order, and otherwise <span class="mbox" style="width:"><tt class="ttfamily">NEITHER</tt></span>.</p>
