<div class="problembody">
<p>A close friend of yours, a duck with financial problems, has
    requested your help with a matter that will help him pay off
    his debts. He is the nephew of an extremely wealthy duck, who
    has a large vault, filled with mountains of coins. This wealthy
    duck has a certain coin in his possession which has a lot of
    sentimental value to him. Usually, it is kept under a
    protective glass dome on a velvet cushion.</p>
<p>However, during a recent relocating of the coins in the
    vault, the special coin was accidentally moved into the vault,
    leading to an extremely stressful situation for your friend’s
    uncle. Luckily, the coin has recently been located.
    Unfortunately, it is completely opposite to the entrance to the
    vault, and due to the mountains of coins inside the vault,
    actually reaching the coin is no simple task.</p>
<p>He is therefore willing to pay your friend to retrieve this
    coin, provided that he brings his own equipment to scale the
    mountains of coins. Your friend has decided he will bring a
    ladder, but he is still uncertain about its length. While a
    longer ladder means that he can scale higher cliffs, it also
    costs more money. He therefore wants to buy the shortest ladder
    such that he can reach the special coin, so that he has the
    largest amount of money left to pay off his debts.</p>
<p>The vault can be represented as a rectangular grid of stacks
    of coins of various heights (in meters), with the entrance at
    the north west corner (the first height in the input, the
    entrance to the vault is at this height as well) and the
    special coin at the south east corner (the last height in the
    input). Your avian companion has figured out the height of the
    coins in each of these squares. From a stack of coins he can
    attempt to climb up or jump down to the stack immediately
    north, west, south or east of it. Because your friend cannot
    jump or fly (he is a very special kind of duck that even wears
    clothes), successfully performing a climb of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> meters will require him to bring a
    ladder of at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    meters. He does not mind jumping down, no matter the height; he
    just lets gravity do all the work.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers: the length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, and the width
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> of the vault,
    satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M,N \leq
    1000$</span>.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines
    each contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers.
    Each integer specifies the height of the pile of coins in the
    vault at the corresponding position. (The first line describes
    the north-most stacks from west to east; the last line
    describes the south-most stacks from west to east). The heights
    are given in meters and all heights are at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> (yes, your friend’s uncle is
    very rich).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing a single integer: the length
    in meters of the shortest ladder that allows you to get from
    the north west corner to the south east corner.</p>
