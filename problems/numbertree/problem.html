<p>Lovisa is at KTH listening to Stefan Nilsson lecturing about
    perfect binary trees. “A perfect binary tree has a
    distinguished node called the <em>root</em> which is usually
    drawn at the top. Each node has two children except the nodes
    in the lowest layer, which we call <em>leaves</em>.” Lovisa
    knows all this already, so she is a bit bored. Noticing this,
    Stefan comes up with a new challenge for Lovisa.</p>
<p>First, we label the nodes of a perfect binary tree with
    numbers as follows. We start at the bottom right leaf which
    gets number 1 and then label nodes on the same level in
    increasing order from right to left. After finishing a level,
    we move to the rightmost node in the level above and label all
    the nodes on that level from right to left. We proceed in this
    fashion until we reach the root.</p>
<p>When we want to describe a node in the tree, we can do it by
    describing a path starting at the root and going down toward
    the leaves. At each non-leaf node we can either go left
    (<tt class="tt">‘L’</tt>) or right (<tt class="tt">‘R’</tt>).</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: Labeled binary tree of height 3 with two
          marked paths from the root. Path <tt class="tt">LR</tt>
          leads to label 11 while path <tt class="tt">RRL</tt>
          leads to 2. The root has number 15.

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Lovisa’s task is to calculate the label of a node, given the
    height of the tree <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> and
    the description of the path from the root.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The only line of input contains the height of the tree
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le H\le 30$</span> and a string consisting
    of the letters <tt class="tt">‘L’</tt> and <tt class="tt">‘R’</tt>, denoting a path in the tree starting in the
    root. The letter <tt class="tt">‘L’</tt> denotes choosing the
    left child, and the letter <tt class="tt">‘R’</tt> choosing the
    right child. The description of the path may be empty and is at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> letters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing the label of the node given by
    the path.</p>
