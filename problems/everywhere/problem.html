<div class="description"></div>
</div>Alice travels a lot for her work. Each time she travels,
    she visits a single city before returning home.

    <p>Someone recently asked her “how many different cities have
    you visited for work?” Thankfully Alice has kept a log of her
    trips. Help Alice figure out the number of cities she has
    visited at least once.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 50$</span> indicating the
    number of test cases. The first line of each test case also
    contains a single positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> indicating the number of work
    trips Alice has taken so far. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines describe these trips. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th such line simply
    contains the name of the city Alice visited on her <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th trip.</p>
<p>Alice’s work only sends her to cities with <em>simple</em>
    names: city names only contain lowercase letters, have at least
    one letter, and do not contain spaces.</p>
<p>The number of trips is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> and no city name contains more
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, simply output a single line containing a
    single integer that is the number of distinct cities that Alice
    has visited on her work trips.</p>
