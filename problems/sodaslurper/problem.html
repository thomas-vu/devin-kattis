<p>Tim is an absolutely obsessive soda drinker, he simply
    cannot get enough. Most annoyingly though, he almost never has
    any money, so his only obvious legal way to obtain more soda is
    to take the money he gets when he recycles empty soda bottles
    to buy new ones. In addition to the empty bottles resulting
    from his own consumption he sometimes find empty bottles in the
    street. One day he was extra thirsty, so he actually drank
    sodas until he couldn’t afford a new one.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Three non-negative integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$e,f,c$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$e&lt;1\, 000$</span> equals the number of
    empty soda bottles in Tim’s possession at the start of the day,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f&lt;1\, 000$</span> the number
    of empty soda bottles found during the day, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le c&lt;2\, 000$</span> the number of
    empty bottles required to buy a new soda.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>How many sodas did Tim drink on his extra thirsty day?</p>
