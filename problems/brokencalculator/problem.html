<p>Working on math homework late one night, you realized your
    calculator is broken. When it performs “addition” it adds the
    two numbers entered, then subtracts the result from the
    previous operation. When it performs “subtraction” it subtracts
    the two numbers entered, then multiplies the result by the
    previous operation’s result. When it performs “multiplication”
    it squares its answer after multiplying the two numbers
    entered. When it performs “division” it divides the first
    number by <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> if it is
    even, otherwise it adds <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to the first number and divides it
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.</p>
<p>You also notice that when the calculator is turned on the
    previous operation’s result is set to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. You realize that doing math
    homework this way makes it more fun and want to write a program
    to perform calculations like your broken calculator.</p>
<p>You spoke to your teacher about your broken calculator and
    they gave you the guarantee that even with this weird behavior
    your calculator will never have to compute numbers larger than
    one quintillion (<span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{18}$</span>) on your upcoming homework
    assignments.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will begin with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>), the number of commands you want to
    run on your calculator. Following the first line, each line
    will have an integer number <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, an operator <span class="tex2jax_process">$op$</span>, and a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, separated by a single space,
    which denote the first operand, the operation, and the second
    operand, respectively. The operator will be one of <tt class="ttfamily">+</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">-</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">*</tt>, or <tt class="ttfamily">/</tt>. The operands
    will be in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le a, b
    \le 100\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the answer the calculator will show after running the
    command on each line, assuming it is turned on before the first
    line is entered and stays on for all subsequent lines of
    input.</p>
