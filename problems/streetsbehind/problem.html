<div class="problembody">
<p>Your running club has some serious runners and some casual
    runners. You schedule several training runs with a mixture of
    serious runners and casual runners. Serious runners run at a
    faster pace than casual runners, and will leave them
    behind.</p>
<p>You want all the runners to become serious runners, so when
    you schedule training runs, you carefully choose the number of
    serious and casual runners who will participate. You know that
    when there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> serious
    runners and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> casual
    runners in a training run, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{x}{x+y}$</span> is greater than or
    equal to a threshold <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{a}{b}$</span>, then after the run, all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> casual runners,
    feeling the pressure to keep up with the serious runners become
    serious runners moving forward.</p>
<p>Compute the minimum number of training runs you need to
    convert all members of the club into serious runners.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq t \leq 100$</span>). This is the
    number of test cases.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>
    lines contains a test case. Each test case consists of four
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n, k, a, b \leq 10^{9}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a \leq b$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of serious runners,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is the number of
    casual runners, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{a}{b}$</span> is the threshold which
    converts casual runners to serious runners.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> lines, each
    containing a single integer. For each test case, output the
    minimum number of training runs needed to convert all casual
    runners to serious runners. If it is impossible to convert all
    casual runners to serious runners, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> for that test case.</p>
