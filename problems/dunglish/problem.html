        A group of confused Dutchmen. Public domain.
      </div>
</div>A confused Dutchman trying to speak English could say
    “<em>I am in the war</em>”, even though there is no hostile
    activity going on. The confusion<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> here is that
    the English sentence “<em>I am confused</em>” is translated in
    Dutch as “<em>Ik ben in de war</em>”, which is phonetically
    (“sounding”) quite close to the first sentence. Such confusion
    leads to much enjoyment, but can complicate matters a bit.

    <p>Given a sentence in Dutch and a dictionary containing both
    correct translations as well as phonetic (incorrect)
    translations of individual words, find the translation of the
    sentence and indicate whether it is correct, or in case there
    is more than one find the total number of correct and incorrect
    translations. A sentence is correctly translated when each word
    of the sentence is correctly translated.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 20$</span>), the number of
        words in the Dutch sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        words, the Dutch sentence <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 10^5$</span>), the number
        of words in the dictionary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each
        with three strings <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, a Dutch word, the English
        translation, and “<tt class="ttfamily">correct</tt>” if
        this is the correct translation or “<tt class="ttfamily">incorrect</tt>” otherwise.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A word consists of between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> lowercase letters. Each word in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> appears at least once
    as a Dutch word in the dictionary, no word appears more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> times as a Dutch word
    in the dictionary, and each combination of a Dutch and English
    word appears at most once.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>In case there is only a single translation of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, output one line with the
    translation followed by one line with “<tt class="ttfamily">correct</tt>” or “<tt class="ttfamily">incorrect</tt>”. In case there is more than one
    translation, output one line with the number of possible
    correct translations followed by “<tt class="ttfamily">correct</tt>”, and one line with the number of
    possible incorrect translations followed by “<tt class="ttfamily">incorrect</tt>”.</p>
