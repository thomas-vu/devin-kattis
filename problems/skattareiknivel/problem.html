<p>Sigurjón was chosen employee of the month at Krabbaborgarar
    for twelve months in a row, and therefore got a big raise.
    However, Sigurjón knows that he will not directly receive all
    of his salary, first he must pay into a pension fund and a
    supplementary pension fund, and then he has to pay income tax
    and communal tax of the rest. Sigurjón also knows that he gets
    a personal tax exemption every month that can be deducted from
    the total tax, and if he does not use all of his personal tax
    exemption one month, he can use the rest of it the following
    month! Sigurjón wants to know how much of his salary he will
    receive after paying all fees and taxes, but the calculations
    are too complicated for him. Can you help Sigurjón?</p>
<p>Taxes of individual’s salary are calculated as follows:</p>
<p>First you have to pay into a pension fund and a
    supplementary pension fund. The fees are calculated as a
    percentage of the total salary before tax. The total salary
    minus the fund fees are called tax base, which is rounded down
    to the nearest integer. We represent this using <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lfloor x \rfloor $</span>, therefore
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lfloor 11.3 \rfloor =
    11$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lfloor 25.99
    \rfloor = 25$</span>. For example, if an individual’s monthly
    salary is <span class="tex2jax_process">$500\, 000$</span> ISK,
    and he pays <span class="tex2jax_process">$4\% $</span> into a
    pension fund, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\% $</span>
    into a supplementary pension fund, then the individual pays
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lfloor 500\, 000 \cdot 0.04
    \rfloor = 20\, 000$</span> ISK into a pension fund and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lfloor 500\, 000 \cdot 0.01
    \rfloor = 5\, 000$</span> ISK into a supplementary pension
    fund. The tax base is then <span class="tex2jax_process">$500\,
    000 - 20\, 000 - 5\, 000 = 475\, 000$</span> ISK.</p>
<p>It is necessary to pay income tax, and communal tax of the
    tax base to the state, and to the municipality that the
    individual lives in, respectively. The income tax is divided
    into different tax brackets, and in each bracket it is
    necessary to pay a certain percentage of the tax base that is
    covered by the bracket. The communal tax is not divided into
    brackets. The sum of the income tax and the communal tax is
    called withholding tax, which is also rounded down to the
    nearest integer.</p>
<p>In 2023, we have the following three tax brackets in Iceland
    and we assume mean communal tax of <span class="tex2jax_process">$14.67\% $</span>:</p>

<p>If the tax base is <span class="tex2jax_process">$475\,
    000$</span> ISK, then it completely covers the first bracket,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$409\, 986$</span> ISK in that
    bracket, and partially covers the second bracket, <span class="tex2jax_process">$65\, 014$</span> ISK in that bracket. The
    individual therefore pays <span class="tex2jax_process">$31.45\% $</span> of the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$409\, 986$</span> ISK, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$37.95\% $</span> of the remaining
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$65\, 014$</span> ISK. The total
    withholding tax is then <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lfloor
    0.3145 \cdot 409\, 986 + 0.3795 \cdot 65\, 014 \rfloor = 153\,
    613$</span> ISK.</p>
<p>Finally, the personal tax exemption is deducted from the
    withholding tax, and the result is the amount that the
    individual has to pay in taxes of the tax base. If the
    withholding tax is lower than the personal tax exemption, then
    the personal tax exemption is accrued (but not retroactively).
    In 2023, the personal tax exemption is <span class="tex2jax_process">$59\, 665$</span> ISK per month. For example,
    if the withholding tax is <span class="tex2jax_process">$153\,
    613$</span> ISK, then the individual has to pay <span class="tex2jax_process">$153\, 613 - 59\, 665 = 93\, 948$</span> ISK
    of the tax base, and therefore receives a salary of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$475\, 000 - 93\, 948 = 381\,
    052$</span> ISK after paying all fees and taxes. In this case,
    the personal tax exemption was fully used, and nothing is
    carried over to the next month.</p>
<p>Had the withholding tax been <span class="tex2jax_process">$30\, 000$</span> ISK, and the personal tax
    exemption still <span class="tex2jax_process">$59\, 665$</span>
    ISK, then the individual would not have needed to pay anything
    of the tax base, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$59\, 665 -
    30\, 000 = 29\, 665$</span> ISK of the personal tax exemption
    would have carried over to the next month. The invididual would
    therefore have a personal tax exemption of <span class="tex2jax_process">$59\, 665 + 29\, 665 = 89\, 330$</span> ISK
    the following month.</p>
