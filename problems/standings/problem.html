<p>Usually, results of competitions are based on the scores of
    participants. However, we are planning a change for the next
    year of IPSC. During the registration each team will be able to
    enter a single positive integer – their preferred place in the
    ranklist. We would take all these preferences into account, and
    at the end of the competition we will simply announce a
    ranklist that would please all of you.</p>
<p>But wait… How would that ranklist look like if it won’t be
    possible to satisfy all the requests?</p>
<p>Suppose that we already have a ranklist. For each team,
    compute the distance between their preferred place and their
    place in the ranklist. The sum of these distances will be
    called the <em>badness</em> of this ranklist.</p>
<p>Given team names and their preferred placements find one
    ranklist with the minimal possible badness.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input file contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T, T\leq 20$</span>, specifying
    the number of test cases. Each test case is preceded by a blank
    line.</p>
<p>Each test case looks as follows: The first line contains an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N (N\leq 100\,
    000)$</span> – the number of teams participating in the
    competition. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains a team name (a
    string of letters and numbers of length at most 20) and its
    preferred place (an integer between 1 and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, inclusive). No two team names
    will be equal.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each of the test cases output a single line with a
    single integer – the badness of the best ranklist for the given
    teams.</p>
