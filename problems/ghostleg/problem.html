<p>A <em>Ghost Leg</em> is a method for representing
    permutations.</p>
<p>A Ghost Leg can be represented as a set of vertical lines,
    each line corresponding to one element of the set being
    permuted. Horizontal lines (like the rungs of a ladder) connect
    adjacent vertical lines in such a way that no two rungs share
    an endpoint. An example is shown in the illustration to the
    right.</p>
<p>To determine the resulting position of any element under a
    Ghost Leg permutation, begin at the top of the vertical line
    corresponding to that element. Trace a path down the line until
    encountering the first rung touching that line. Follow that
    rung to the adjacent vertical line. It does not matter whether
    the rung goes to the left or to the right, just follow it.
    Continue downward, following rungs, until reaching the bottom.
    This gives the final position of that element under the
    permutation.</p>
<p>In the example, element <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> ends up third in the permutation.
    The path is shown with red dotted lines. Likewise, element
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> ends up fourth,
    element <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> ends up first,
    and element <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> ends up
    second.</p>
<p>Given a description of a Ghost Leg, determine the result of
    the permutation. In other words, apply the specified
    permutation, and output the elements in their permuted
    order.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le m \le 1{,}000$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of elements being
    permuted, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the
    number of rungs. The vertical lines (elements) are identified
    from left to right by the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le a &lt; n$</span>), which indicates that there is a rung
    between vertical lines <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a+1$</span>. The rungs are
    listed in order from top to bottom of the Ghost Leg. Clearly,
    no two rungs can be at the same height.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, where
    each line contains a single integer. This is the resulting
    permutation. The first line is the element that ends up first
    in the permutation, the second is the element that ends up
    second, and so on.</p>
