<p>In a game of American Football, there are several factors to
    take into consideration when detailing the rules of the game.
    The goal of the game is to move the football across the field
    into the endzone of the defending team through a series of
    plays, which form a drive. In each play, the attacking team may
    either gain or lose a number of yards, that is, their position
    on the field moves either towards or away from the defending
    team’s endzone.</p>
<p>In the simplified version of football that we consider, a
    team has four chances (in up to four plays) to advance the ball
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> yards downfield; if
    they are successful, they will have achieved a “first down” and
    keep possession of the ball. If they achieve a first down, they
    have another up to four plays to continue their drive towards
    the defending team’s endzone. If they keep possession and reach
    the defending team’s endzone, they will have achieved a
    Touchdown. If they are pushed back into their own endzone, a
    Safety occurs and ends the drive. Otherwise the team loses
    possession of the ball and Nothing happens.</p>
<p>Sadly, the outcome of a drive has been lost, and all that
    remains is the yards gained or lost on each play! Your job is
    to determine whether a Touchdown, Safety, or Nothing occurred
    on the given drive.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we assume that the team starts the drive on
    their own <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> yard line
    on a <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> yard field
    (with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> being the team’s
    own endzone, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>
    being the defending team’s endzone). This means that a
    touchdown is scored if at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$80$</span> yards are gained in total,
    relative to the starting position, and without losing
    possession due to failing to get a first down. Note that it is
    possible for a team to score a Touchdown without getting a
    first down. A safety occurs if the team is pushed back
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> yards from their
    original starting position, which would place them in their own
    endzone. Nothing occurs if neither of these events occurs.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts of a line containing one integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 15$</span>), which is the number
    of plays that this given drive recorded. Following this line
    are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers
    representing the numbers of yards gained or lost on each
    particular play. Each given number is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$-100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> yards (exclusive range) since
    that is the length of the football field.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single word, the result of the drive! If a
    touchdown is achieved, output “<tt class="ttfamily">Touchdown</tt>”, if a safety is achieved, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">Safety</tt>”, else output “<tt class="ttfamily">Nothing</tt>”. (Do not add a period at the end.)
    Once the outcome has been determined, your program should
    ignore any remaining yards listed in the drive.</p>
