<p>Lindsay is a shopaholic. Whenever there is a discount of the
    kind where you can buy three items and only pay for two, she
    goes completely mad and feels a need to buy all items in the
    store. You have given up on curing her for this disease, but
    try to limit its effect on her wallet.</p>
<p>You have realized that the stores coming with these offers
    are quite selective when it comes to which items you get for
    free; it is always the cheapest ones. As an example, when your
    friend comes to the counter with seven items, costing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$400$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$350$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$300$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$250$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$150$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> dollars, she will have to pay
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1500$</span> dollars. In this
    case she got a discount of <span class="tex2jax_process">$250$</span> dollars. You realize that if she
    goes to the counter three times, she might get a bigger
    discount. E.g. if she goes with the items that costs
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$400$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$300$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$250$</span>, she will get a discount of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$250$</span> the first round. The
    next round she brings the item that costs <span class="tex2jax_process">$150$</span> giving no extra discount, but
    the third round she takes the last items that costs
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$350$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> giving a discount of an
    additional <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> dollars,
    adding up to a total discount of <span class="tex2jax_process">$350$</span>.</p>
<p>Your job is to find the maximum discount Lindsay can
    get.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input gives the number of items Lindsay is
    buying, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le n \le 200\,
    000$</span>. The next line gives the prices of these items,
    which are integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le p_ i
    \le 200\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line giving the maximum discount Lindsay can get
    by selectively choosing which items she brings to the counter
    at the same time.</p>
