<div class="problembody">
<p>Nick is preparing a problem for a programming contest about
    comparing big integers. He has decided on the input format for
    the integers: They will be expressed in base 62, with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> representing digit values
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, lowercase letters <tt class="ttfamily">a</tt> through <tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>
    representing digit values <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$35$</span>, and uppercase letters <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt> through <tt class="ttfamily">Z</tt>
    representing digit values <span class="tex2jax_process">$36$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$61$</span>. For example, the string
    <tt class="ttfamily">Aa</tt> would represent <span class="tex2jax_process">$36 \times 62 + 10 = 2242$</span>.</p>
<p>The problem is to take two strings representing two distinct
    base 62 integers and determine which of the two is smaller.
    However, Nick wrote his judge solution incorrectly, assuming
    that the lexicographically smaller string is always the smaller
    integer.</p>
<p>Given some test cases, determine for each if Nickâ€™s solution
    would report the correct result.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq t \leq 10^5$</span>). This is the
    number of test cases.</p>
<p>Each test case consists of two lines.</p>
<p>The first line contains a single alphanumeric string of
    length at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^5$</span>.</p>
<p>The second line contains a single alphanumeric string of
    length at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^5$</span>.</p>
<p>Both strings are guaranteed to contain no unnecessary
    leading zeroes, and the two strings are guaranteed to be
    distinct.</p>
<p>The sum of the lengths of all input strings across all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> test cases is
    guaranteed to be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \times 10^6$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line with <tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt> if the lexicographically smaller string
    represents the smaller integer in base 62, and output a single
    line with <tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt> otherwise.</p>
