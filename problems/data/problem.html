<p>Today everyone is talking about big data. As a renowned data
    provider in the area, you now have <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> precious pieces of data. You want
    to sell all <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> pieces of
    data to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> customers. You
    can sell multiple pieces of data (including all and none) to a
    single customer. However, each piece of data must be sold to
    exactly one customer (you cannot split a single piece of data
    and sell it to multiple customers).</p>
<p>In your previous transactions you simply sold bigger data
    for higher prices. Unfortunately, that did not work quite well
    and your customers were a bit unsatisfied about the value of
    the data they got. Obviously, the value of data is not
    necessarily positively correlated with its volume.</p>
<p>This time you decide to do something different. After many
    meetings you finally sign a new contract with your customers.
    You number the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> pieces
    of data from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and figure out that
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> piece
    of data has a special property <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ i$</span>. The new contract specifies
    that each customer shall pay you an amount of money that is
    equal to the number of distinct prime factors in the sum of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ i$</span>â€™s of the data
    pieces sold to him/her.</p>
<p>Based on the new contract, what is the maximum revenue you
    can achieve by selling all <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> pieces of data?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line has a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 14$</span>). The second line has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> positive integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_1, S_2, \ldots , S_ N$</span>. These
    integers are no larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum revenue you can achieve by selling all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> pieces of data.</p>
