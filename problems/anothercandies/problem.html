<p>A class went to a school trip. And, as usually, all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> kids have got their
    backpacks stuffed with candy. But soon quarrels started all
    over the place, as some of the kids had more candies than
    others. Soon, the teacher realized that he has to step in:
    "Everybody, listen! Put all the candies you have on this table
    here!"</p>
<p>Soon, there was quite a large heap of candies on the
    teacher’s table. "Now, I will divide the candies into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> equal heaps and
    everyone will get one of them." announced the teacher.</p>
<p>"Wait, is this really possible?" wondered some of the
    smarter kids.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>You are given the number of candies each child brought. Find
    out whether the teacher can divide the candies into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> exactly equal heaps.
    (For the purpose of this task, all candies are of the same
    type.)</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input file contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T, 1\le T \le 100$</span>
    specifying the number of test cases. Each test case is preceded
    by a blank line.</p>
<p>Each test case looks as follows: The first line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N, 1\le N \le 20\, 000$</span> –
    the number of children. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains the number of
    candies one child brought. Each child has less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{63}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each of the test cases output a single line with a
    single word "<tt class="tt">YES</tt>" if the candies can be
    distributed equally, or "<tt class="tt">NO</tt>" otherwise.</p>
