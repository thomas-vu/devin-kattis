<p>Do you like golf? I hate it. I hate golf so much that I
    decided to build the ultimate golf robot, a robot that will
    never miss a shot. I simply place it over the ball, choose the
    right direction and distance and, flawlessly, it will strike
    the ball across the air and into the hole. Golf will never be
    played again.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it doesn’t work as planned. So, here I am,
    standing in the green and preparing my first strike when I
    realize that the distance-selector knob built-in doesn’t have
    all the distance options! Not everything is lost, as I have 2
    shots.</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>Given my current robot, how many holes will I be able to
    complete in 2 strokes or less?</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line has one integer: <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of different distances
    the Golf Bot can shoot. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines has one integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_ i$</span>, the distance
    marked in position <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> of
    the knob.</p>
<p>Next line has one integer: <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, the number of holes in this
    course. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines has one integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ j$</span>, the distance from
    Golf Bot to hole <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N, M \leq 200\,
    000$</span><br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k_ i, d_ j \leq 200\,
    000$</span></p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>You should output a single integer, the number of holes Golf
    Bot will be able to complete. Golf Bot cannot shoot over a hole
    on purpose and then shoot backwards.</p>
<h3>Sample Output Explanation</h3>
<p>Golf Bot can shoot 3 different distances (1, 3 and 5) and
    there are 6 holes in this course at distances 2, 4, 5, 7, 8 and
    9. Golf Bot will be able to put the ball in 4 of these:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The 1<span class="tex2jax_process">$^{st}$</span> hole,
        at distance 2, can be reached by striking two times a
        distance of 1.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 2<span class="tex2jax_process">$^{nd}$</span> hole,
        at distance 4, can be reached by striking with strength 3
        and then strength 1 (or vice-versa).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 3<span class="tex2jax_process">$^{rd}$</span> hole
        can be reached with just one stroke of strength 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 5<span class="tex2jax_process">$^{th}$</span> hole
        can be reached with two strikes of strengths 3 and 5.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Holes 4 and 6 can never be reached.</p>
