<div class="problembody">
<p>You are the chair of a large department, and, as such, it’s
    your job to assign department members to committees. Everyone
    has to be on exactly one committee, but some department members
    don’t get along and cannot be assigned to the same committee.
    Of course, you would like to have as few committees as possible
    since it’s hard to make up jobs for committees you don’t really
    need (<i class="itshape">e.g.</i>, committee for snack machine
    pricing oversight, committee for shredding procurement,
    committee for committee name selection). What you need is a
    program that figures out how many committees are needed so that
    no mutually hostile department members are placed on the same
    committee.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> department descriptions. Each
    begins with a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n
    \le 15$</span> and a non-negative integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m \le n(n-1)/2$</span>. The value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> indicates the number
    of people there are in the department, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> tells how many pairs of people
    don’t get along. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each listing the names of
    two different department members who don’t get along.</p>
<p>A name is a sequence of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> lowercase and/or uppercase
    letters (a–z), and each department member has a unique name.
    The end of input is marked with a pair of zeros for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each department description, print out a line giving the
    minimum number of committees needed to keep mutually hostile
    department members on different committees.</p>
