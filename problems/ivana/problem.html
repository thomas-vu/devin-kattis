<p>Even though she saw Zvonko steal Mirko’s microprocessor in
    the second task, Mirko’s sister Ivana did not tell Mirko
    because she likes Zvonko. She suggested to him that they go see
    a movie together so that she would “forget” about the
    incident.</p>
<p>Zvonko does not care much for girls because they take away
    precious time he usually spends practicing his math-fu. He
    suggested that the two of them play a game and, if Ivana wins,
    they will go see a movie together. Ivana agreed, being good at
    jump rope and she sometimes even kicks a football around with
    her two brothers.</p>
<p>Zvonko laid <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    positive integers in a circle on the floor and explained the
    rules:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first player takes any number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second player takes either of the two numbers
        adjacent to the one the first player took.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The next player takes a number adjacent to any of the
        numbers taken so far, and so on until they run out of
        numbers. The player to take more odd numbers (not divisible
        by 2) wins.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Zvonko plays optimally; he always looks for a strategy that
    leads to certain victory or a draw. Zvonko does not know how
    well Ivana plays. Being a true cavalier, he let Ivana have the
    first move. But Ivana only cares about sitting next to Zvonko
    in front of the big screen so she seeks help playing.</p>
<p>Write a program that finds how many different first moves
    Ivana can make, so that she has a chance of winning
    afterwards.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq N \leq 100)$</span>, how many numbers there are in the
    circle. The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers separated by single
    spaces. All numbers will be between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> (inclusive). No two numbers
    will be the same.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the desired number on a single line.</p>
