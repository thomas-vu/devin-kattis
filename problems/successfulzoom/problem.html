<div class="problembody">
<p>Your boss likes to see numbers going up as proof that your
    company is successful. To help with this, you came up with the
    idea to summarize a list of numbers by “zooming out,” that is,
    to discard everything except every <span class="tex2jax_process">$k^{th}$</span> number in the list, for some
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k\ge 1$</span>.</p>
<p>Business has been tough lately, with lots of ups and downs.
    However, if you pick the right value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, maybe you can prove to your boss
    that things aren’t so bad after all! If possible, you should
    find the smallest value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ k&lt;x_{2k}&lt;\dots &lt;x_{qk}$</span>,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$q=\lfloor \frac nk\rfloor
    $</span>, and the list <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_
    k,x_{2k},\dots ,x_{qk}$</span> contains at least two
    elements.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\le n\le 10^5$</span>. The second line
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1,x_2,\dots ,x_ n$</span>
    describing the list of numbers. It is guaranteed that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le x_ i\le 2^{30}$</span> for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i=1,\dots ,n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If possible, display the smallest value <span class="tex2jax_process">$k\ge 1$</span> for which <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ k,x_{2k},\dots ,x_{qk}$</span> (where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q=\lfloor \frac nk\rfloor
    $</span>) is strictly increasing and has at least two elements.
    If no such value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    exists, display the word “<tt class="ttfamily">ABORT!</tt>”</p>
