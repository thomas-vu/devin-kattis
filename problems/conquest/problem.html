<div class="problembody">
<p>Nomads, Kingdoms, and Tribes are on the islands of the great
    seas. Bridges span between islands allowing travel between
    them. It is possible to get from every island to every other
    island through some sequence of bridges. The islands were at
    peace until everything changed when the Spanning Nation
    attacked!</p>
<p>Initially the Spanning Nation occupies island 1. From that
    point forward, the Spanning Nation can attack any island that
    is directly connected to some island already conquered by the
    Spanning Nation. Thankfully wars are resolved without any
    fighting. The Spanning Nation only attacks an island if the
    island’s army is strictly smaller than the Spanning Nation’s
    army. The smaller island army will simply concede and join the
    Spanning Nation’s army.</p>
<p>As the tactical advisor of the Spanning Nation, determine
    the maximum possible army size the Spanning Nation can have
    after making a series of attacks.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 200\, 000$</span>), which is the number of islands,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq M \leq 200\, 000$</span>), the number
    of bridges.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines
    describe the bridges. Each of these lines contains two distinct
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq u, v \leq N$</span>), indicating that
    there is a bridge between the islands <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>. There is at most one bridge
    between any pair of islands.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    describe the islands’ army size in order. Each of these lines
    contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq s \leq 1\, 000$</span>), which is the army size of this
    island.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the maximum possible army size of the Spanning
    Nation.</p>
