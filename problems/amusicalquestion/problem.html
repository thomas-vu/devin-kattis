<p>Bob Roberts likes to listen to music while he drives, but
    the car he owns is a little antiquated. No Bluetooth or USB
    connections here, but at least he has a CD player, so heâ€™s been
    transferring a lot of his music to CDs. At the moment he has
    only two CDs left and would like to get as much of his
    remaining music as possible on them. Given the capacity of the
    CDs and collection of songs, can you help him find the maximum
    number of minutes of music he can put on the two CDs?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq c\leq 1\, 000)$</span> is the number of minutes of music
    each CD can hold, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq n \leq 1\, 000)$</span>
    is the number of songs to select from. Following this is a
    single line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    positive integers indicating the length (in minutes) of each of
    the songs. No song will be longer than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> minutes.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the amount of music on each CD, in minutes, that
    maximizes the total amount of music that Bob can transfer to
    the two CDs. Display the time of the larger-filled CD first. If
    there is a tie, use the solution which minimizes the time
    difference between the two CDs.</p>
