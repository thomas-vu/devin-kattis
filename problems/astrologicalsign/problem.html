<p>Harry Potter and his friends are now fourth-year students at
    Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This year, one of
    their subjects is <i class="itshape">Astrology</i>. To become a
    successful wizard, Astrology is crucial, as it allows one to
    predict future events or gain insights into people’s
    personalities and relationships.</p>
<p>In the first lecture, Harry Potter and his friends need to
    learn and understand <i class="itshape">Astrological Signs</i>.
    One’s <i class="itshape">Astrological Sign</i> is determined by
    their birthday, according to the following table:</p>

</center>
<p>For example, if one’s birthday is on <b class="bfseries">May
    5th</b>, their Astrological Sign is <b class="bfseries">Taurus</b>, as it lies between <b class="bfseries">Apr 21st</b> and <b class="bfseries">May
    20th</b>.</p>
<p>Today Harry Potter wants to determine the Astrological Sign
    of all his classmates. Please help him!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le t \le 1\, 000)$</span> — the
    number of Harry Potter’s classmates.</p>
<p>In the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> line,
    each line contains a birthday in the format <tt class="ttfamily">d m</tt>, where <tt class="ttfamily">d</tt> is the
    date, and <tt class="ttfamily">m</tt> is the first three
    letters of the name of the month (with the first letter in
    uppercase, the second and third letters in lowercase). It is
    guaranteed that all the given dates are valid.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> lines, each
    line contains the name of the Astrological Sign.</p>
