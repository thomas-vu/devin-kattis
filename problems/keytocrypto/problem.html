<p>Suppose you need to encrypt a top secret message like “SEND
    MORE MONKEYS”. You could use a simple substitution cipher,
    where each letter in the alphabet is replaced with a different
    letter. However, these ciphers are easily broken by using the
    fact that certain letters of the alphabet (like ‘E’, ‘S’, and
    ‘A’) appear more frequently than others (like ‘Q’, ‘Z’, and
    ‘X’). A better encryption scheme would vary the substitutions
    used for each letter. One such system is the <i class="it">autokey</i> cipher.</p>
<p>To encrypt a message, you first select a secret word – say
    “ACM” – and prepend it to the front of the message. This longer
    string is truncated to the length of the message and called the
    <i class="it">key</i>, and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n^{th}$</span> letter of the key is used to
    encrypt the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n^{th}$</span>
    letter of the original message. This encryption is done by
    treating each letter in the key as a cyclic shift value for the
    corresponding letter in the message, where ‘A’ indicates a
    shift of <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, ‘B’ a shift
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and so on. Using
    “ACM” as the secret word, we would encrypt our message as
    follows:</p>

<table cellspacing="0" class="tabular">

<p><tt class="tt">SENDMOREMONKEYS</tt></p>

<td style="text-align:left">

</td>
<td style="border-top-style:solid; border-top-color:black; border-top-width:1px; text-align:left">
<p>(ciphertext)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</center>
<p>Note that the letter ‘E’ in the message was encrypted as ‘G’
    the first time it was encountered (since the corresponding
    letter in the key was ‘C’ indicating a shift of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>), but then as ‘Q’ and ‘S’ the next
    two times.</p>
<p>Your task is simple: given a ciphertext and the secret word,
    you must determine the original message.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of two lines. The first contains the
    ciphertext and the second contains the secret word (which may
    be longer than the ciphertext). Both lines contain only
    uppercase alphabetic letters. Both the ciphertext and the
    secret word are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span> letters long.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the original message that generated the given
    ciphertext using the given secret word.</p>
