</div>The famous City Central Zoo houses just two creatures,
    Zebras and Ocelots. These magical creatures spend their time in
    a single, tall column, each standing atop the back of the
    creature below it. Whenever the zoo bell rings, the ocelot
    lowest in the pile turns into a zebra, and all zebras (if there
    are any) below that creature simultaneously turn into ocelots.
    If there is no ocelot in the pile when the bell tolls, then
    nothing happens. The zookeeper has been watching this
    interesting process for years. Today, suddenly, he begins to
    wonder how much longer this can go on. That is, given a pile of
    zebras and/or ocelots, how many times may the bell toll before
    there are no more ocelots?

    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span>, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, each of which is a single
    character, either <tt class="tt">Z</tt> (for zebra) or
    <tt class="tt">O</tt> (for ocelot). These give the order of the
    creatures from top (first) to bottom (last).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output should be a single integer giving the number of times
    the bell must toll in order for there to be no more
    ocelots.</p>
