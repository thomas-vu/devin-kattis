<p>Electric scrolling signs are often used for advertising. A
    given sign displays exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> characters. When the sign is
    switched on, all of the character positions are initially empty
    (showing spaces). In each time interval, all of the characters
    on the sign are shifted to the left by one position, and a new
    character is added at the right-most position. The character
    that was in the left-most position moves off the sign.</p>
<p>For certain sequences of words, it is possible to reuse
    characters from one word to form a subsequent word. For
    example, on a sign with three character positions, the sign can
    display the message <tt class="tt">CAT ATE TED</tt> by
    scrolling in the five characters <tt class="tt">CATED</tt>.</p>
<p>The advertiser has a specific message to show using the
    sign. The faster the message is displayed, the more people will
    be able to see the whole message. Therefore, your job is to
    find a way to display all the words of the message by scrolling
    in the smallest number of letters. In between showing the words
    of the message, the sign may display other words that are not
    considered part of the message. However, the words of the
    message must be shown in the order in which they are given.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n, 1\le n\le 5$</span>, the
    number of test cases to follow. Each test case starts with a
    line containing a two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, the number of character positions
    on the sign, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, the
    number of words in the message. Each of the two integers is
    between 1 and 100, inclusive. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> lines each contain a word of the
    message comprising exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> uppercase letters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing a single
    integer, the minimum number of letters that must be scrolled
    into the sign so that it displays all the words of the
    message.</p>
