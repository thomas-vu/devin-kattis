<div class="problembody">
<p>The island municipality of Soteholm is required to write a
    plan of action for their work with emission of greenhouse
    gases. They realize that a natural first step is to decide
    whether they are for or against global warming. For this
    purpose they have read the IPCC report on climate change and
    found out that the largest effect on their municipality could
    be the rising sea level.</p>
<p>The residents of Soteholm value their coast highly and
    therefore want to maximize its total length. For them to be
    able to make an informed decision on their position in the
    issue of global warming, you have to help them find out whether
    their coastal line will shrink or expand if the sea level
    rises. From height maps they have figured out what parts of
    their islands will be covered by water, under the different
    scenarios described in the IPCC report, but they need your help
    to calculate the length of the coastal lines.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>You will be given a map of Soteholm as an <span class="tex2jax_process">$N\times M$</span> grid. Each square in the
    grid has a side length of 1 km and is either water or land.
    Your goal is to compute the total length of sea coast of all
    islands. Sea coast is all borders between land and sea, and sea
    is any water connected to an edge of the map only through
    water. Two squares are connected if they share an edge. You may
    assume that the map is surrounded by sea. Lakes and islands in
    lakes are not contributing to the sea coast.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two space separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N,M\leq 1000$</span>. The following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each contain a
    string of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    consisting of only zeros and ones. Zero means water and one
    means land.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with one integer, the total length of the
    coast in km.</p>
