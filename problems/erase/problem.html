<p>Jon Marius is the computer expert at his company and has now
    been tasked to find some software for erasing data properly. It
    is very important that the data should not be recoverable
    afterwards, so it should be overwritten on the hard drive
    several times. Unable to find any free program up to the task,
    Jon Marius decides to write such a program himself. The user
    interface is simple, it only asks for the file to be destroyed
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of
    times it should be overwritten. This number can range from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> (quick deletion) to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> (maximum security).
    Jon Marius processes the file bit by bit and does not consider
    writing a zero where there was already a zero as really
    overwriting. So for each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> sweeps, he overwrites each zero
    with a one, and each one with a zero, respectively.</p>
<p>Jon Marius knows that independent testing is important, so
    he has asked you to write the verification routine. He will not
    listen to your objections to the algorithm so eventually you
    give in.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 20$</span>. The
    two following lines each contain a string containing only the
    characters <tt class="tt">0</tt> and <tt class="tt">1</tt>. The
    first of these lines represent the bits of the file before
    deletion and the second the bits on the same position on the
    hard drive after the file has been deleted. The length of these
    strings are the same and between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing either the words “<tt class="tt">Deletion succeeded</tt>” if each bit is switched
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> times or “<tt class="tt">Deletion failed</tt>” if this is not the case.</p>
