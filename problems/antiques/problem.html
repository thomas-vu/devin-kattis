<div class="problembody">
<p>You are hosting a fancy party for fancy friends. And, like
    any fancy party, you need to buy some fancy antiques to put up
    around the venue (your house).</p>
<p>There is a set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    fancy antiques that you need to buy. And there is a set of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> fancy antique shops in
    the city. Because these antiques are extremely rare, each fancy
    antique can only be found at a single fancy antique shop.
    However, the fancy antique shops can also sell “knock-off”
    (duplicate) versions of some of the antiques. And of course,
    for any fancy antique, there is only a single fancy antique
    shop in the city that holds a knock-off version of that antique
    (this is to maintain the rareness of the antiques). The shop
    that sells the original is not always the same shop that holds
    the knock-off.</p>
<p>It turns out that even though you can tell the difference,
    most people cannot tell the original version from the knock-off
    version of any given antique. And, because the shops can get
    away with it, sometimes the knock-off is more expensive than
    the original! Since the party is tomorrow, you only have time
    to visit <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> shops. You
    would like to buy one version (either the original or the
    knock-off) of each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> antiques.</p>
<p>Suppose that there are three shops, and three antiques we
    would like to buy.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Antique <span class="tex2jax_process">$\# 1$</span>
        sells for <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> at shop
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$\# 1$</span>. Its knockoff
        sells for <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> at shop
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$\# 2$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Antique <span class="tex2jax_process">$\# 2$</span>
        sells for <span class="tex2jax_process">$70$</span> at shop
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$\# 2$</span>. Its knockoff
        sells for <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> at shop
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$\# 3$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Antique <span class="tex2jax_process">$\# 3$</span>
        sells for <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> at shop
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$\# 3$</span>. Its knockoff
        sells for <span class="tex2jax_process">$80$</span> at shop
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$\# 1$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Suppose you only have time to go to two shops. You can go to
    shops <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. You can buy the original of
    antique <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> with cost
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> at shop <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, the original of antique
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> with cost <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> at shop <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, and the knock-off of antique
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> at shop <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> with cost <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. The total cost to buy these
    items is <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span>, which is
    the minimum possible.</p>
<p>If you only have time to visit one shop, then it is
    impossible. You cannot buy a version of all three items by
    visiting a single shop.</p>
<p>Given the costs of the antiques/knock-offs at the shops,
    what is the minimum total cost to buy one version of each
    antique?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that
    your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The
    first line of input will consist of three space-separated
    integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le k
    \le m \le 40$</span>). The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines will each have four space
    separated integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>, describing an antique, where:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is the index of
        the shop that sells the original version of the antique
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a \le m$</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is the price of
        the original version of the antique at shop <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le p \le 10^7$</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> is the index of
        the shop that sells the knock-off version of the antique
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le b \le m$</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> is the price of
        the knock-off version of the antique at shop <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le q \le 10^7$</span>)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is possible to collect all of the antiques while
    visiting no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    stores, then output the minimum cost. If it is not possible,
    output <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
