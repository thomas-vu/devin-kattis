<p>The summer is closing in and you have set your eyes on a
    summer internship with your favourite fruit confederacy,
    Citrus. What you <em>really</em> want is to take over the
    entire organisation on your way to world fruit domination, but
    getting an internship is a nice first step.</p>
<p>You know that there is a single person in Citrus deciding
    who gets the internship, but unfortunately, you donâ€™t know who
    that person is. Thus, you decide to infiltrate the entire
    organization by bribing some subset of members, so that you are
    guaranteed to get the internship. You have already gathered the
    organization map, as well as estimated the amount of money each
    member would require to aid your candidacy. The only thing
    remaining is deciding who to recruit.</p>
<p>When you bribe a Citrus member, that member will be able to
    manipulate both their superior as well as their direct
    subordinates to support your candidacy. In this way it is not
    necessary to bribe everyone in Citrus, as long as everyone in
    the organisation is either bribed or manipulated by someone who
    is.</p>
<p>In addition, you want to take an extra precaution. You do
    not want two different people to both be bribed if they ever
    talk to each other; then they might realize what your final
    plan is, and start blackmailing you. Citrus protocol dictates
    that nobody should ever discuss anything with anyone who is not
    their immediate boss or subordinate, so you figure your scheme
    will be sufficiently safe as long as you avoid bribing the
    immediate superior of someone else you bribe.</p>
<p>To initiate the infiltration you are to write a program that
    given the organizational map of Citrus as well as the cost of
    recruiting each of its members, outputs the minimum amount of
    money required to complete the task. Because Citrus is so
    well-organized, every member has exactly one immediate
    supervisor, except the one and only <em>most sour
    excellence</em>, who has only subordinates.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line consists of an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 100\, 000$</span>, the number
    of members in Citrus. Then follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, each describing a member,
    beginning with member <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    and ending with member <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span>. The line describing member
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> begins with two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq C_ i \leq 1\,
    000\, 000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq U_
    i &lt; N$</span>, the cost of recruiting member <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and the number of immediate
    subordinates of member <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    respectively. Then follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$U_
    i$</span> numbers on the same line, the identification numbers
    of the subordinates. Note that all identification numbers are
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The minimum cost of infiltrating the entire organization
    while adhering to the restrictions above. Observe that the
    answer might very well be larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{32}$</span>.</p>
