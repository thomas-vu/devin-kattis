<div class="problembody">
<p>Ashley has given Brandon a square of side <span class="tex2jax_process">$2024$</span>. She also has drawn a single
    line segment that connects two different sides of the
    square.</p>
<p>Brandon wants to draw some additional line segments such
    that it is possible to decompose the square into a set of
    disjoint triangles, where each triangle has sides that are
    either subsegments of the sides of the square, or subsegments
    of any drawn line segment.</p>
<p>Compute the minimum number of additional line segments
    Brandon needs to draw to make this possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Imagine that the square is axis-aligned with its bottom-left
    corner at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 0)$</span> and
    top-right corner at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2024,
    2024)$</span>.</p>
<p>Input has a single line with four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \leq 2024$</span>)
    specifying the coordinates of the end points of the line
    segment initially drawn by Ashley. One end point is at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1)$</span> and the other
    end point is at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2,
    y_2)$</span>.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed the two end points are distinct. Both end
    points are on sides of the square. If the segment intersects a
    side of the square, it does so at exactly one point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the minimum number of additional
    line segments Brandon needs to draw.</p>
