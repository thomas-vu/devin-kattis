<p>Erika the economist studies economic inequality. Her model
    starts in a situation where everybody has the same amount of
    money. After that, people’s wealth changes in various
    complicated ways.</p>
<p>Erika needs to run a simulation a large number of times to
    check if her model works. The simulation consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> people, each of whom
    begins with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> kroners. Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> events happen, of three different
    types:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>An event of type “SET <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>” means that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th person’s wealth is set to
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An event of type “RESTART <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>” means that the simulation is
        restarted, and everybody’s wealth is set to <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An event of type “PRINT <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>” reports the current wealth of
        the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th person.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Unfortunately, Erika’s current implementation is very slow;
    it takes far too much time to keep track of how much money
    everybody has. She decides to use her algorithmic insights to
    speed up the simulation.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line includes two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10^6$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq Q \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$</span>. The
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines each
    start with a string that is either “SET”, “RESTART”, or
    “PRINT”. There is guaranteed to be at least one event of type
    “PRINT”.</p>
<p>If the string is “SET” then it is followed by two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x \leq 10^4$</span>. If the string is
    “RESTART” then it is followed by an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x \leq 10^4$</span>. If the string is
    “PRINT” then it is followed by an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq N$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each event of type “PRINT”, write the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th person’s capital.</p>
