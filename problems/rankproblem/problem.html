<p>Coach is fed up with sports rankings – he thinks those who
    make up these bogus orderings are just nuts. In Coach’s opinion
    changes in rankings should be evidence-based only. For example,
    suppose the <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>th place
    team plays the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>st place
    team and loses. Why should the rankings be altered? The “worse”
    team lost to the “better” team, so nothing should change in the
    rankings. Put another way, there’s no evidence that the
    ordering should change so why change it? The only time you
    change something is if, say, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>th place team beats the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>st place team. NOW you
    have evidence that the rankings should change! Specifically,
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>st place team
    should be put directly below the <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>th place team (we now have evidence
    that backs this up) and the teams in <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>nd through <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>th place should each move up one.
    The result is that the former <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>st place team is now in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>th, one position below
    the team that beat it, the former <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>th place team now in <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>rd. Note that the relative
    positions of the teams now in <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>st to <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>rd place do not change – there was
    no evidence that they should.</p>
<p>To generalize this process, assume the team in position
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> beats the team in
    position <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>. If
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n &lt; m$</span> then there
    should be no change in the rankings; if <span class="tex2jax_process">$n &gt; m$</span> then all teams in positions
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m+1, m+2, \ldots , n$</span>
    should move up one position and the former team in position
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> should be moved to
    position <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>For example, assume there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> teams initially ranked in the
    order T<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> (best),
    T<span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, T<span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, T<span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, T<span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> (worst). Suppose T<span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> beats T<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Then as described above the new
    rankings should become T<span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, T<span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, T<span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, T<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, T<span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>. Now in the next game played let’s
    say T<span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> beats
    T<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. After this the
    rankings should not change – the better ranked team beat the
    worse ranked team. If in the next game T<span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> beats T<span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> the new rankings would be
    T<span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, T<span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, T<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, T<span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, T<span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, and so on.</p>
<p>Coach was all set to write a program to implement this
    scheme but then he heard about ties in the English Premier
    League. The last we saw him he was standing motionless, staring
    out of his window. We guess it’s up to you to write the
    program.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a line containing two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$n,
    m \leq 100$</span>) indicating the number of teams and the
    number of games played. Team names are <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mbox{T}1, \mbox{T}2, \ldots ,
    \mbox{T}n$</span> and initially each team <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mbox{T}i$</span> is in position
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> in the rankings (i.e.,
    team <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mbox{T}1$</span> is in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>st place and team
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mbox{T}n$</span> is in last
    place). Following the first line are <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines detailing a set of games in
    chronological order. Each of these lines has the form
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mbox{T}i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mbox{T}j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i,j \leq n, i \neq j$</span>)
    indicating that team <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mbox{T}i$</span> beat team <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mbox{T}j$</span>.</p>
