<div class="problembody">
<p>The Perl programming language makes it easy to implement
    counters that mix numeric and alphabetic characters. Lower-case
    letters behave as if they are a base-<span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span> digit counting from <tt class="ttfamily">a</tt> up to <tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>, upper-case
    letters behave as if they are a base-<span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span> digit counting from <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt> up to <tt class="ttfamily">Z</tt> and decimal
    digits behave as usual. The fun part is that you can mix all
    three types of digits into a single string and incrementing
    still works fine, with carries propagating from one type of
    digit to another. For example, incrementing the string
    <tt class="ttfamily">aB9</tt> gives you <tt class="ttfamily">aC0</tt>. If a carry propagates out of the
    high-order digit, Perl adds a new digit of the same type as the
    previous high-order digit, so incrementing <tt class="ttfamily">zZz9</tt> gives <tt class="ttfamily">aaAa0</tt>.</p>
<p>Perl places some restrictions on the structure and use of a
    counter like this. In particular, all decimal digits must be at
    the right end of the counter and incrementing by one is the
    only available operation. In this problem, implement a
    Perl-like counter keeping these restrictions.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains several test cases, one per line. Each test
    case consists of a counter <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> followed by a desired increment
    amount <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. The value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is non-empty and may
    consist of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>
    upper-case letters, lower-case letters and decimal digits. All
    decimal digits are to the right of any alphabet characters. The
    value <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is given as a
    decimal integer in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0,
    1\, 000\, 000]$</span>. The sequence of test cases ends at the
    end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For every test case, print out a line giving the value of
    counter <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> after it has
    been incremented <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    times.</p>
