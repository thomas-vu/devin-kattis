<p>The word <em>the</em> is the most common three-letter word.
    It even shows up inside other words, such as “o<em>the</em>r”
    and “ma<em>the</em>matics”. Sometimes it hides, split between
    two words, such as “no<em>t he</em>re”. Have you ever wondered
    what the most common words of lengths other than three are?</p>
<p>Your task is the following. You will be given a text. In
    this text, find the most common word of length one. If there
    are multiple such words, any one will do. Then count how many
    times this most common word appears in the text. If it appears
    more than once, output how many times it appears. Then repeat
    the process with words of length 2, 3, and so on, until you
    reach such a length that there is no longer any repeated word
    of that length in the text.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a sequence of lines. The last line of
    input is empty and should not be processed. Each line of input
    other than the last contains at least one but no more than one
    thousand uppercase letters and spaces. The spaces are
    irrelevant and should be ignored.</p>
<p>Note that the last line of the sample input is a blank
    line.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line of input, output a sequence of lines, giving
    the number of repetitions of words of length 1, 2, 3, and so
    on. When you reach a length such that there are no repeated
    words of that length, output one blank line, do not output
    anything further for that input line, and move on to the next
    line of input.</p>
<p>Note that the last line of the sample output is a blank
    line.</p>
