<div class="problembody">
<p>Your favorite uncle has passed away, leaving you a large
    estate. Bank account numbers, locations of safe deposit boxes,
    and GPS coordinates to buried treasures are all locked in an
    electronic safe in your uncle’s office behind a picture of dogs
    playing poker. One day he showed you the safe with its
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> digit keypad (digits
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>). He told you he wasn’t worried
    about anyone breaking into his safe because it’s equipped with
    a self-destruct mechanism that will destroy the contents if
    anyone attempts a forced entry.</p>
<p>The combination is a sequence of six decimal digits. If an
    incorrect combination is entered the safe enforces a
    thirty-second delay before accepting another combination. So a
    brute-force effort to try all six-digit combinations could take
    months.</p>
<p>Your uncle had planned to give you, his sole heir, the
    combination one day, but due to an unfortunate hang-gliding
    accident in Kansas, you now must rely on your deductive and
    programming skills to access the key to your inheritance.</p>
<p>Here’s what you know:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The combination <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>
        is a sequence of six non-zero decimal digits.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your mother recalls that she heard your uncle mention
        that all the digits are different.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You remember that your uncle once said that the six
        digit number was divisible by each of its individual
        digits.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An example satisfying these conditions is <span class="tex2jax_process">$123864$</span>: all six digits differ, and
    you can check that <span class="tex2jax_process">$123864$</span> is divisible by each of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>.</p>
<p>Even with the helpful data, it could take a while to get to
    open the safe, so the task is likely to be split into several
    sessions with separate ranges being tested. How many
    combinations are there to try in the range given?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a line with two space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$123\, 456 \leq L &lt; H \leq 987\,
    654$</span></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print one integer, the total number of possible combinations
    to the safe, where each combination <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> must satisfy the three constraints
    above, and lie in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$L
    \leq c \leq H$</span>.</p>
