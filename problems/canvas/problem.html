<p>After last year’s success, Samuel W. E. R. Craft’s fame
    continues to grow and now he has funds for all kinds of
    projects that cross his mind. His newest idea involves creating
    arrays of canvasses with color patterns having no repeated
    colors.</p>
<p>Samuel bought a set of white canvasses of varying sizes.
    Since painting them manually would take too much time, he
    devised a huge machine to automate the painting process.<br/>
    The painting process works as follows:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Assemble all canvasses in a line in the machine’s
        conveyor belt, disposed in some chosen order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pick a color <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>
        and a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span>
        (which should be less than the number of color <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> canvasses).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Going from left to right, all canvasses with color
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> are painted. The
        first <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span>
        color <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>
        canvasses are painted with a new color <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and the remaining
        color <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>
        canvasses are painted with a new color <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>. Colors <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> are selected by the machine,
        are distinct, and are different from any color used
        previously. The amount of ink spent in this step is equal
        to the sum of the sizes of the painted canvasses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat 2) and 3) until all canvasses have distinct
        colors.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Consider for example that Samuel bought four canvasses of
    sizes <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>. The following picture shows
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> different options for
    painting them.</p>

<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Given the sizes of the canvasses Samuel bought, can you help
    Samuel finding the minimum amount of ink the machine needs to
    spend in order to have all canvasses with different colors?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line consists of a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the number of test cases. Each
    test case is composed by two lines. The first line consists of
    a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    representing the number of canvasses. The next line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space separated
    integers representing the sizes of the canvasses.</p>
<h2>Constraints</h2>
<table cellspacing="0" class="tabular">
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq
          100$</span></p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>Number of test cases.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N_ i \leq 100\,
          000$</span></p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>Number of canvasses in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> test case.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s \leq 100\,
          000$</span></p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>Size of each canvas.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq \sum _{i=1}^{T}
          N_ i \leq 100\, 000$</span></p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>Number of canvasses over all test cases in one test
          file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    lines, one for each test case: the minimum amount of ink the
    machine needs in order to have all canvasses with different
    colors.</p>
