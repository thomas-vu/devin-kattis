        A spy from Bowser’s army.
      </div>
</div>
<p>Princess Peach is trying to organize the armies of Mushroom
    Kingdom to repel Bowser’s attack. However, her orders keep
    getting intercepted by Bowser’s top spy Mr. L. Peach has tried
    multiple encryption methods, but Mr. L has cleverly decrypted
    all attempts. However, Peach’s espionage unit has just found
    out that Mr. L doesn’t know how to multiply numbers! They
    quickly designed a cypher to exploit this.</p>
<p>The MKIA (Mushroom Kingdom Intelligence Agency) has designed
    the following mapping from numbers to characters: <span class="tex2jax_process">$0-25$</span> corresponds to <span class="tex2jax_process">$A-Z$</span>, and this pattern repeats
    forever: <span class="tex2jax_process">$26-51:A-Z, 52-77:A-Z,
    \ldots $</span>. The MKIA first selects some secret sequence of
    numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1s_2\ldots s_
    l$</span> Given the secret number string, the MKIA can encrypt
    a message as follows:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>For each character in the message, use the MKIA mapping
        to find its corresponding number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Multiply that number with the corresponding digit in the
        secret number string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use the MKIA mapping to transform this result back into
        a character for the encrypted result.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Given a number string and a series of messages, return the
    encrypted messages after applying the previous algorithm.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line is a sequence of digits representing the
    multiplier in each position of the test cases. This has length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq l \leq 100$</span>. The second line
    represents <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number
    of test cases. <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1\,
    000$</span> The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines are the messages to be encoded. These messages are
    guaranteed to have length <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    containing the encoded strings.</p>
