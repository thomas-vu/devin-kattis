<p>Nicolaus Copernicus, born in Toruń in the Kingdom of Poland
    in 1473, was the first to develop a view of the universe which
    placed the Sun, rather than the Earth, at the center of the
    orbiting planets. Copernicus viewed each planet as revolving in
    a circular orbit with the Sun as the common center of each
    circle. This new model, which was later improved by many other
    astronomers, made it much simpler to understand and predict the
    motions of the planets. Pictured below is his rendering of the
    planetary orbits.</p>

<p>Consider two of the planets in Copernicus’ orbital system:
    Earth and Mars. Assume the Earth orbits the Sun in exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$365$</span> Earth days, and Mars
    orbits the Sun in exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$687$</span> Earth days. Thus the Earth’s
    orbit starts at day <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    and continues to day <span class="tex2jax_process">$364$</span>, and then starts over at day
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. Mars orbits
    similarly, but on a <span class="tex2jax_process">$687$</span>
    day time scale. We would like to find out how long it will take
    until both planets are on day <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> of their orbits simultanously.
    Write a program that can determine this.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of multiple test cases, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. Each test case is described by a
    single line containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq e &lt; 365$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq m &lt; 687$</span>. These indicate
    which days Earth and Mars are at their respective orbits.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, display the case number (starting at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and incrementing for
    each case) followed by the smallest number of days until the
    two planets will both be on day <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> of their orbits. Follow the format
    of the sample output.</p>
