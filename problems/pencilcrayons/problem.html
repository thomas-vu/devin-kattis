<div class="problembody">
<p>Mr. Daniels bought a set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> identical boxes of pencil crayons
    for his classroom, each containing the same set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> distinct colours of pencils. Over
    the course of the year, the pencil crayons got mixed up between
    the boxes. Surprisingly, none of them have been lost (yet). But
    some boxes may not have <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> distinct colours any more.</p>
<p>Mr. Daniels has a gap in his schedule and the break room is
    currently undergoing maintenance. He might as well rearrange
    the pencil crayons so each box again has exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> distinct colours. To do this, he
    will first remove a number of pencil crayons from each box
    (perhaps <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>) and then
    place the removed pencil crayons back in boxes.</p>
<p>Help Mr. Daniels figure out the minimum number of pencil
    crayons that need to be removed so that he can place them back
    in boxes to ensure each box again has <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> distinct colours of pencil
    crayons. The order the pencil crayons are arranged in a box
    does not matter, just that all <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> colours are now present in each
    box.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 100$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq K \leq 100$</span>). Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines follow. Each line describes
    the contents of a box by listing <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> strings describing the pencil
    crayons that are currently found in that box.</p>
<p>Each string describing a colour will have a length between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> and will only contain lowercase
    letters. There will be exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> distinct strings appearing among
    all rows describing the boxes and each such string will appear
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> times.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single number indicating the fewest pencil crayons
    that need to be removed from all boxes so that Mr. Daniels can
    place them back in the boxes while ensuring each box has
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> distinct
    colours.</p>
