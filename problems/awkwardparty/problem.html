<p>Martin has invited everyone he knows to celebrate his 535th
    birthday, and a whopping <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> people from all over the world
    have accepted the invitation.</p>
<p>When deciding the seating arrangement, Martin’s mother
    Margarethe have decided that all the guests should be seated
    with <em>maximum awkwardness</em>; this is to ensure that
    nobody has anything meaningful to discuss during dinner, and
    everyone would instead silently enjoy her rather tasty
    coriander soup (as the saying goes; “when the food is good,
    conversation dies”).</p>
<p>Margarethe knows that awkwardness is maximized if the guests
    are seated in a long row along a single table, in such a way
    that nobody sits next to someone speaking the same language as
    themselves. Better yet, she has defined the <em>awkwardness
    level</em> of a seating arrangement to be the minimum number of
    seats separating any two guests speaking the same language. If
    no two people speak the same language, the awkwardness level is
    defined to be <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (the
    number of guests). Two seats next to each other are said to be
    separated by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<p>Given the languages spoken in a proposed seating
    arrangement, can you help Margarethe determine the awkwardness
    level?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 100\, 000$</span>) denoting the number of guests.
    On the second line follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th of which <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x_ i \leq 10^9$</span>) indicating
    the language spoken by the guest seated at position
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> in the proposed
    arrangement (each guest speaks exactly one language).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single integer, the awkwardness level of the proposed
    seating arrangement.</p>
