<p>Jill has created a new smartphone game that leads players to
    find a treasure. The app uses the phone’s GPS to determine the
    player’s location. The app then tells the player the direction
    in which to go on a route to find the treasure. When the player
    reaches some specific location, the app rewards the player with
    a (virtual) treasure.</p>
<p>Can you help the player determine how long it will take to
    find the treasure?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, each between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span>, inclusive. These integers
    define the number of rows and columns in the playing area,
    respectively. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>
    lines of input describe the playing area. Each line contains
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> letters, and
    each letter defines the action to take in each location in the
    playing area. There are five possible letters:</p>
<dl class="description">
<dt><tt class="ttfamily">N</tt></dt>
<dd>
<p>indicates a move to the previous row,</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt class="ttfamily">S</tt></dt>
<dd>
<p>indicates a move to the next row,</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt class="ttfamily">W</tt></dt>
<dd>
<p>indicates a move to the previous column,</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt class="ttfamily">E</tt></dt>
<dd>
<p>indicates a move to the next column, and</p>
</dd>
<dt><tt class="ttfamily">T</tt></dt>
<dd>
<p>indicates the location of the treasure.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Exactly one location contains the treasure.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The player begins playing at the location in the first
    column of the first row. The player follows the directions at
    each location. If the player eventually reaches the treasure by
    following the directions, output a line containing an integer,
    the number of moves required to reach the treasure. If the
    directions cause the player to leave the playing area, output a
    line containing the word <tt class="ttfamily">Out</tt>. If the
    directions cause the player to stay in the playing area but
    never reach the treasure, output a line containing the word
    <tt class="ttfamily">Lost</tt>.</p>
