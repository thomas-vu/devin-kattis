<p>When you are writing programs for a scripting language, you
    often have to worry about how special characters are handled.
    If you want to suppress special interpretation and have a
    special character handled literally, you can escape it by
    putting a backslash in front of it. In fact, since backslash
    is, itself, a special character, you also have to escape
    backslashes if you want them interpreted literally. For
    example, to get a shell program to print out <tt>*\</tt>, you
    might have to type something like: <tt>echo \*\\</tt></p>
<p>Of course, script programmers can’t stop at just one level
    of interpretation. We can write Perl code that outputs shell
    script, which, itself, might output instructions for something
    like sed. Each level of interpretation will think that
    backslashes escape only the character immediately after them.
    If we want a special character to make it through several
    levels of interpretation, we may have to place more backslashes
    in front of it. For example, we could get the shell to print
    out a single backslash with: <tt>echo `echo \\\\`</tt></p>
<p>Write a program to determine how backslashes should be
    inserted in order to produce some desired literal string after
    multiple levels of interpretation. We’ll assume that all ASCII
    characters from <tt>!</tt> up to and including <tt>*</tt> are
    special. Also, characters from <tt>[</tt> up to and including
    <tt>]</tt> are considered special. If string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> needs to be output after one level
    of interpretation, we have to start with a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s’$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$s’$</span> is just like <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, but with every special character
    in <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> escaped. If we want
    to produce <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> after two
    levels of interpretation, we have to start with a string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s’{}’$</span> that is just like
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s’$</span>, but with every
    special character in <span class="tex2jax_process">$s’$</span>
    escaped.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> test cases. Each test case has
    two lines. The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n \le 8$</span>, the number of levels
    of interpretation that should be applied. The second line
    contains a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
    using only printable ASCII characters, of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>. Test cases will end with the
    end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s’$</span> containing appropriate
    backslashes to produce the given string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> after <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> levels of interpretation.</p>
