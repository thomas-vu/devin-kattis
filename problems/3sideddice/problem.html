<div class="problembody">
<p>Just like every fall, the organizers of the Southwestern
    Europe Dice Simulation Contest are busy again this year. In
    this edition you have to simulate a <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-sided die that outputs each of
    three possible outcomes (which will be denoted by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>) with a given probability, using
    three dice in a given set. The simulation is performed this
    way: you choose one of the given dice at random, roll it, and
    report its outcome. You are free to choose the probabilities of
    rolling each of the given dice, <em>as long as each probability
    is strictly greater than zero</em>. Before distributing the
    materials to the contestants, the organizers have to verify
    that it is actually possible to solve this task.</p>
<p>For example, in the first test case of the sample input you
    have to simulate a die that yields outcome <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> with probabilities <span class="tex2jax_process">$3/10$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4/10$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3/10$</span>. We give you three dice, and in
    this case the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th of
    them always yields outcome <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$i = 1, 2, 3$</span>. Then it is possible to
    simulate the given die in the following fashion: roll the first
    die with probability <span class="tex2jax_process">$3/10$</span> , the second one with
    probability <span class="tex2jax_process">$4/10$</span> and the
    last one with probability <span class="tex2jax_process">$3/10$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> test cases, separated by single
    blank lines. Each test case consists of four lines: the first
    three of them describe the three dice you are given and the
    last one describes the die you have to simulate. Each of the
    four lines contains 3 space-separated integers between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span> inclusive. These numbers
    will add up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>,
    and represent <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>
    times the probability that rolling the die described in that
    line yields outcome <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, respectively.</p>
<p>The test cases will finish with a line containing only the
    number zero repeated three times (also preceded with a blank
    line).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, your program should output a line with the
    word <tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt> if it is feasible to produce
    the desired die from the given ones, and <tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt> otherwise.</p>
