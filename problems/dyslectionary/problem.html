<p>Have you ever been uncertain how to spell a word? If you ask
    someone, they will sometimes just tell you to look it up, and
    that’s fine if you know how the word starts. However, it’s not
    much help if you only feel certain about how the word ends. To
    help give a equal treatment to words that are easy to spell at
    the end, you have developed the Dyslectionary<span class="tex2jax_process">$^\textrm {TM}$</span>. The Dyslectionary is
    just like an ordinary dictionary except that it organizes words
    based on how they end rather than how they start. The first
    section covers words ending with ‘a’. Within this section words
    are ordered by their second-to-last letter, and so on. If two
    words have the same suffix, the shorter word is sorted earlier.
    To help organize your Dyslectionary, you are developing a
    simple computer program to harvest words from ordinary
    dictionaries.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> word groups. Each word group
    contains up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>
    words, one word per line, listed in regular dictionary order.
    All words contain only lowercase English letters a – z. A blank
    line separates each pair of consecutive groups.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each group, print out its words in Dyslectionary order,
    one word per line. Use a blank line to separate consecutive
    groups. To make words easy to lookup, right-justify them so
    that they all end at the same column and there is just enough
    space to fit all the words.</p>
