<div class="problembody">
<p>A group of students is taking a True/False exam. Each
    question is worth one point. You, as their teacher, want to
    make your students look as good as possible—so you cheat! (I
    know, you would never actually do that.) To cheat, you
    manipulate the answer key so that the lowest score in the class
    is as high as possible.</p>
<p>What is the best possible lowest score you can achieve?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le k \le 10$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of students, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is the number of
    True/False questions on the exam.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains a string of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, consisting only of upper-case
    ‘<tt class="tt">T</tt>’ and upper-case ‘<tt class="tt">F</tt>’.
    This string represents the answers that a student submitted, in
    the order the questions were given.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output, on a single line, the best possible lowest score in
    the class.</p>
