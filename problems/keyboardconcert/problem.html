<p>Olav has some electronic keyboards and would like to play a
    tune. Unfortunately all of Olav’s keyboards are broken so each
    of them can only play some of the notes. By switching which
    instrument he is using he will be able to play the whole tune,
    but moving keyboards around is annoying so he would like to
    minimize the amount of times he has to switch. Can you help
    Olav figure out the minimum number of keyboard switches needed
    to play the entire song?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input is two space separated integers;
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span>) the number of
    instruments, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 1\, 000$</span>),
    the number of notes in the tune. This is followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each starting
    with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k_ i \leq 1\,
    000$</span>), the number of notes playable by instrument
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_ i$</span> pairwise distinct
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell _1, \ell _2,
    \ldots , \ell _{k_ i}$</span>, the notes that instrument
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> can play (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq \ell _ j \leq 1\, 000$</span>).
    Finally, there is a line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> space-separated integers – the
    notes of the tune in order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The minimum number of times Olav needs to switch the
    instrument he is using during the tune.</p>
