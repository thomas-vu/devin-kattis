<p>The great German mathematician C. F. Gauss studied
    the criteria for the equation</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ x^2\equiv a \pmod{p} \]</span>
<p>to have an integer solution <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> for a prime <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>. For some tuples <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> there are several solutions,
    whereas others have none. For instance, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x^2\equiv 2 \pmod{7}$</span> has the
    solutions <span class="tex2jax_process">$3+7k$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4+7k$</span> for all integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, but there are no
    solutions to <span class="tex2jax_process">$x^2\equiv 3
    \pmod{7}$</span>. The terminology “<span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is a quadratic residue modulo
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>” is used to describe
    the case when there are solutions to the tuple <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>. Identities for quadratic residues
    are often elegantly put in terms of the Legendre
    symbol</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    {\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)}=\left\{ \begin{array}{rl} 0 &amp;
    \mbox{If $p$ divides $a$.} \\ 1 &amp; \mbox{If $p$ does not
    divide $a$ and $x^2\equiv a \pmod{p}$ has a solution.} \\ -1
    &amp; \mbox{Otherwise.}\end{array}\right. \]</span>
<p>For positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a,b$</span> and prime <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, the following simple identity is
    known to hold</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    {\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)}{\left(\frac{b}{p}\right)}={\left(\frac{ab}{p}\right)}
    \]</span>
<p>Far more obscure is the identity proved by Gauss in 1801,
    expressed as a conjecture by Euler in 1783, and succeeding two
    erroneous proofs by Legendre (even mathematicians make mistakes
    at times), called <em>the law of quadratic reciprocity</em>. It
    says, that for distinct odd primes <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>,</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    {\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)}{\left(\frac{q}{p}\right)}=(-1)^{(p-1)(q-1)/4}
    \]</span>
<p>Expressions like the one above support the old mathematical
    pun “the only odd prime is two”, since it is not generally true
    when one of the primes is two. It turns out though, that there
    is another simple relationship accounting for the case
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a=2$</span>. Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> be an odd prime (No, <em>not</em>
    two!), then</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    {\left(\frac{2}{p}\right)}=(-1)^{(p^2-1)/8} \]</span>
<p>Armed with these identities, you shouldn’t have any trouble
    answering whether a given quadratic equation has a solution or
    not, should you?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line of input is a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, telling the number of
    test scenarios to follow. Each test scenario is described as
    two positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
    and a prime <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, both less
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{32}$</span> on a line of
    their own.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test scenario, output “yes” if there is at least
    one integer solution <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$x^2\equiv a \pmod{p}$</span>
    for the given numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, or “no” if there
    aren’t any.</p>
