<p>Cady’s Chocolate Company just opened down the street! Cady’s
    chocolate is world famous, and her recipe is top secret. But
    the company is more renowned for the fact that they sell the
    chocolate in random quantities. Each box of chocolate may
    contain anywhere from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> pieces.</p>
<p>Bob’s nephews, John and Sam, love Cady’s Chocolate, but Bob
    has a dilemma. John will get jealous of Sam if he gets more
    pieces of chocolate, and vice versa. Bob knows how many pieces
    of chocolate are in each box.</p>
<p>Write a program to help him determine if it is possible to
    split the boxes between John and Sam such that both get the
    same number of pieces of chocolate, and such that all boxes of
    chocolate are used.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line
    contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>),
    the number of boxes of chocolate Bob bought. The next line
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> representing the
    number of pieces of chocolate in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> box (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le a_ i \le 100$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is possible for Bob to split the boxes such that John
    and Sam get the same number of pieces of chocolate, output
    <tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt>. Otherwise, output <tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt>.</p>
