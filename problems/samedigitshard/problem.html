<p>Two positive integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, are called
    <em>digit-preserving</em> if their product, <span class="tex2jax_process">$xy$</span>, contains exactly the same digits
    as <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> contain together, including
    repetitions. For example, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$x =
    807$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y = 984$</span>,
    then their product, <span class="tex2jax_process">$794088$</span>, contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{one}~ 7$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{one}~ 9$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{one}~ 4$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{one}~ 0$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{two}~ 8\textrm{'s}$</span>, which is
    exactly the same set of digits and corresponding frequencies as
    in <span class="tex2jax_process">$807$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$984$</span> combined.</p>
<p>Given an interval, <span class="tex2jax_process">$[A,B]$</span>, find all digit-preserving
    pairs, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x, y$</span>, in the
    interval, <b class="bf">with the additional requirement that
    their product must also be in the same interval</b>, i.e., all
    three of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x, y, xy$</span> are in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[A,B]$</span>. To avoid
    double-counting, you can assume <span class="tex2jax_process">$x \leq y$</span> (this avoids, for example,
    treating <span class="tex2jax_process">$(807, 984)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(984, 807)$</span> as different
    digit-preserving pairs).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing two
    space-separated integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq A \leq B \leq 200\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>First output a single line containing “<span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <tt class="ttfamily">digit-preserving pair(s)</tt>”, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of digit-preserving
    pairs in <span class="tex2jax_process">$[A,B]$</span> (as
    described above). Then output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each of which contains one
    of the digit-preserving pairs and the corresponding product.
    Carefully format your output as in the sample output (note the
    single space separating adjacent tokens). These lines should be
    sorted by increasing value <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{of}~ x$</span>, breaking ties by
    increasing value <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{of}~
    y$</span>.</p>
