<div class="problembody">
<p>On her spare time Caitlin loves to do speed typing.
    Unfortunately Caitlyn was never good at spelling. So what often
    happens is that Catelin makes a mistake spelling a word, and
    has to go back and fix her typo. One word in particular that
    Caitlynn has a hard time spelling is the word <tt class="ttfamily">mischievous</tt>. Catelyn usually spells it
    <tt class="ttfamily">mischevious</tt> instead. In order to fix
    this typo, Caytlin needs to do 12 keys presses.</p>

<p>Katelin thinks that no matter how much time she puts into
    speed typing, she will always make mistakes. But maybe she can
    get better at quickly fixing her mistakes. Katelyn would like
    you to help her with this.</p>
<p>Suppose that Caytlyn has just written the word <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_1$</span>, but that she should have
    written <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_2$</span>. Assume that
    the cursor is initially at the end of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_1$</span>, and that after fixing the typo,
    Caitlin needs to place the cursor at the end of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_2$</span>. Output the fewest number of key
    presses needed to make <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_1$</span> into <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_2$</span>.</p>
<p>The keys you are allowed to use are</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>the left and right arrow keys.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the back space key.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the keys <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{a},
        \ldots , \texttt{z}$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You are not allowed to press back space or the left arrow
    key when the cursor is all the way to the left. You are also
    not allowed to press the right arrow key when the cursor is all
    the way to the right.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first two lines contain the strings <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_1$</span> respectively <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_2$</span>. Both <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_2$</span> consist only of lowercase
    English letters, and are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters long.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line with the fewest number of key presses
    needed to make <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_1$</span> into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_2$</span>.</p>
