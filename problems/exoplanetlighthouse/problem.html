<p>As humanity travels to extraterrestrial bodies, the need for
    human or robotic explorers to determine their location on the
    surface will be critical. Lighthouses offer a simple solution
    as line-of-sight navigational beacons. An important measurement
    for lighthouses is geographic range, the maximum visible,
    line-of-sight distance between an observer and the lighthouse
    before the lighthouse is obscured by the horizon due to the
    curvature of the surface. The surface <i class="it">traveling</i> distance corresponding to the geographic
    range is crucial for planning fuel and oxygen supplies to
    ensure an accurate—and safe—return to base stations.</p>
<p>Your team is to write a program that computes the maximum
    surface distance that allows for a line-of-sight between an
    observer and a lighthouse. Your program is to assume that
    exoplanets are spherical with a known radius.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le t \le 20$</span>), which is the number
    of test cases.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>
    lines is a separate test case which contains three real
    numbers:</p>
<center>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$100 \le R \le 20\, 000$</span>),
      <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le h_1,h_2 \le 1\, 000$</span>)
    </center>
<p>Where <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> is the radius
    of the exoplanet in kilometers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_1$</span> is the height above the surface
    of the exoplanet of the observer in meters, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_2$</span> is the height of the lighthouse
    beacon above the surface of the planet in meters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> lines, one
    for each test case. On each line output a single real number,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>, which is the maximum
    distance in kilometers on the surface of the exoplanet,
    measured from the base of the observer to the base of the
    lighthouse, that allows for a line-of-sight between the
    observer and the lighthouse beacon. The answer must be accurate
    to within one meter.</p>
