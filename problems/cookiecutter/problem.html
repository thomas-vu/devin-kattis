<p>Theta likes to bake cookies for the upcoming holidays. She
    has a selection of cookie cutters of different shapes and
    sizes. She thinks it’s unfair that some shapes are larger than
    others – because even if everyone gets the same number of
    cookies, some will end up with more dough!</p>
<p>She comes up with a plan to enlarge (or shrink) the cookie
    cutters’ shapes – while retaining their proportions – so that
    all cookies will have the same weight.</p>
<p>Your task in this problem is to help her draw the plans the
    new cookie cutters will be based on!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a single test case, consisting of one cookie
    cutter outline. Cookie cutters are modeled as simple polygons.
    (Simple polygons do not self-intersect.) The first line of
    input contains a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \le N \le 50$</span>) denoting the number of corners of the
    polygon. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines containing two floating
    point numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-500 \le X, Y \le 500$</span>), each
    describing a set of coordinates of a polygon point. Each
    floating point number will have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> digits after the period. The
    coordinates are given in counter-clockwise order.</p>
<p>The next line will contain an integer number <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; A \le 10\, 000\, 000$</span>) denoting the size of the
    desired area to which the polygon should be grown or shrunk.
    (Since the dough is rolled out precisely to an even height
    everywhere, we can use area to represent weight.) The resized
    polygon must be similar to the original polygon, that is, all
    interior angles must be congruent and all corresponding sides
    must have the same ratio.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines with
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> coordinates of the expanded/shrunk
    polygon. Because these coordinates will be used to draw a new
    cookie cutter, your new polygon should lie in the north-east
    quadrant (<span class="tex2jax_process">$x, y \ge 0$</span>)
    and it should touch the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>- and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-axes in at least one point. More
    precisely, you must move the resized polygon horizontally
    and/or vertically so that <span class="tex2jax_process">$\min
    x_ i = \min y_ j = 0$</span>. You may not, however, rotate or
    skew the polygon in any way.</p>
<p>Provide your answers as floating point numbers. Your answer
    will be considered correct if none of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x, y$</span> coordinates have an absolute or
    relative error larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span>.</p>
