<p>Mirko and his faithful friend Slavko got really bored one
    day. The result of their boredom is the creation of a new game!
    In the beginning of the game, they draw <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> points in a coordinate system. The
    players take turns and Mirko plays first. He draws a straight
    line which is parallel to one of the axes of the coordinate
    system and passes through one of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> points. In the following moves,
    the player draws a straight line which is parallel to one of
    the axes of the coordinate system and passes through one of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> points located on the
    line drawn in the previous move of the opponent. No single line
    must be drawn twice. The loser is the player who cannot play
    his move. Determine who has the winning strategy.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains the positive
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10\, 000$</span>). Each of the
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, the coordinates
    of the points drawn (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq X,\,
    Y \leq 500$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the name of
    the winner, either “Mirko” or “Slavko”.</p>
