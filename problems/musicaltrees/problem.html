<p>It’s Christmas time and JW’s <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-dimensional shop is selling
    Christmas trees. However, the demand for trees is much higher
    than the number of trees available. Hence, JW has come up with
    a special strategy to help decide who gets what tree: a game of
    Musical Trees!</p>
<p>Musical Trees is much like the game Musical Chairs. There’s
    a set of trees lined up in a straight (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-dimensional) line. At first,
    everyone starts by wandering around the store while the music
    is playing. When the music stops, everyone runs to the nearest
    tree (the tree the smallest distance away) and whoever reaches
    a tree first gets to the claim that tree. Since people are
    lazy, they will only ever try to run to the closest tree to
    them, and hence multiple people may try to get the same tree.
    Note this means some trees may be unclaimed if they are closest
    to no one. Also, like in Musical Chairs, no tree can be claimed
    by more than one person.</p>
<p>The music has just stopped in Musical Trees and as everyone
    is running to the closest tree, you want to figure out the
    number of people who won’t get any tree.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line consists the number of people <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le n\le 100$</span>) and the number of
    trees <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le 100$</span>). The next line
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1,p_2,\ldots ,p_ n$</span>,
    the positions of all the people when the music stops
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le p_ i \le 1\,
    000$</span>). The last line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1,t_2,\ldots ,t_ m$</span>, the positions
    of all the trees (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le t_ i \le
    1\, 000$</span>). No two people or two trees will have the same
    position. Some people may try to cheat though, and will already
    be at the same position as a tree when the music stops. Note
    that if a person has more than one closest tree to them, they
    will always go for the one with the smallest <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of people who won’t get a tree.</p>
