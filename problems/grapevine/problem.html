<p>According to Wikipedia, to hear something “through the
    grapevine” is to learn of something informally and unofficially
    by means of gossip or rumor. In this problem, you are tasked
    with determining how many people will hear about a particular
    rumor “through the grapevine” after a certain number of
    days.</p>
<p>Rumors are always started by a single person. On any given
    day, a person who knows the rumor can spread it by telling the
    people that they know. Upon hearing of the rumor, that person
    must wait until the following day before they can begin to
    spread it themselves. Furthermore, some people are skeptical
    and will only spread the rumor once they’ve heard it from a
    number of distinct sources. However once a person has heard the
    rumor from enough people, they will always try to spread the
    rumor to as many people as possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line will contain three integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; n \leq 100\, 000$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; m \leq 100\, 000$</span>,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq d \leq 10\,
    000$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is
    the number of people, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    is the number of connections, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is the number of days that
    elapse.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines will
    each consist of a unique string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq t \leq 1000$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is the name of a
    person and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> is their
    level of skepticism. In other words, person <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> must hear the rumor from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> distinct other people
    before <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> will begin
    spreading the rumor.</p>
<p>This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines each consisting of two strings <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> which indicates that person
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and person
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> know each other. Each
    of these lines represents a unique pair of persons.</p>
<p>The final line will contain a single string <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, the name of the person that the
    rumor originates from. Note that <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is the only person with skepticism
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t = 0$</span>. All strings are
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> characters long and
    consists only of English lowercase or uppercase letters and
    digits.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer: the number of people (not including
    person <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>) that have
    heard the rumor after <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>
    days.</p>
