<div class="problembody">
<p>Your friend is an organizer of the International Chess
    Playing Championship. He is worried that some of the
    contestants may be cheating, and he has asked you to help out.
    The chess players are allowed to report matches to the jury
    themselves, and this is not checked with the reported opponent.
    So, it is possible for competitors to make up matches and
    falsely report themselves as the winners.</p>
<p>Since chess is a game of skill, and not of chance, a player
    will <em>always</em> beat their opponent if their skill level
    is higher. A game will result in a draw if and only if the two
    players’ skills are exactly equal.</p>
<p>However, the skill level of the players is not known. He has
    therefore asked you to write a program that, given a list of
    reported matches, determines whether this list is consistent or
    not. The list is inconsistent if we can determine that at least
    one reported match is falsely reported, otherwise it is
    consistent.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 50\, 000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq M \leq 250\, 000$</span>), to describe a championship with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> players and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> reported matches.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines
    each consist of an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, a symbol which is either
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">=</tt>’ or ‘<tt class="ttfamily">&gt;</tt>’, and another integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>. The integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> each uniquely identify a player
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq K, L &lt; N$</span>). If
    the symbol is ‘<tt class="ttfamily">=</tt>’, then the game
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> was a draw. If the
    symbol is ‘<tt class="ttfamily">&gt;</tt>’, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> beat <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> in a match.</p>
<p>You may assume that there is at most one reported match
    between any given pair of players. Also, each player takes part
    in at least one reported match.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing a single word: “<tt class="ttfamily">consistent</tt>” if the list of recorded matches is
    consistent, and “<tt class="ttfamily">inconsistent</tt>” if it
    is not.</p>
