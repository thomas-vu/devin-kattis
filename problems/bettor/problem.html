<p>Recent recessions have not been kind to entertainment
    venues, including the gambling industry. Competition is fierce
    among casinos to attract players with lots of money, and some
    have begun to offer especially sweet deals. One casino is
    offering the following: you can gamble as much as you want at
    the casino. After you are finished, if you are down by any
    amount from when you started, the casino will refund
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x\% $</span> of your losses to
    you. Obviously, if you are ahead, you can keep all of your
    winnings. There is no time limit or money limit on this offer,
    but you can redeem it only once.</p>
<p>For simplicity, assume all bets cost 1 dollar and pay out 2
    dollars. Now suppose <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
    is 20. If you make 10 bets in total before quitting and only 3
    of them pay out, your total loss is 3.2 dollars. If 6 of them
    pay out, you have gained 2 dollars.</p>
<p>Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and the
    percentage probability <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>
    of winning any individual bet, write a program to determine the
    maximum expected profit you can make from betting at this
    casino, using any gambling strategy.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. A test case
    consists of the refund percentage <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le x &lt; 100$</span>) followed by the winning probability
    percentage <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le p &lt; 50$</span>). Both
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> have at most two digits after the
    decimal point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the maximum expected profit with an absolute error
    of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span>.</p>
