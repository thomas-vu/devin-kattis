<div class="problembody">
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    contestants in a reality TV show. Each contestant is assigned a
    point value by the judges and receives votes from the audience.
    The point value given by the judges and the audience’s votes
    are combined to form a <em>final</em> score for the contestant,
    in the following way:</p>
<p>Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> be the sum of
    the judge-assigned point values of all contestants. Now suppose
    a contestant got <span class="tex2jax_process">$J$</span>
    points from the judges, and that she received a fraction
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> (between 0 and 1,
    inclusive) of the audience’s votes (<span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> might be, for example, 0.3). Then
    that contestant’s final score is <span class="tex2jax_process">$J+XY$</span>. Note that the sum of all
    contestants’ audience vote fractions must be 1.</p>
<p>The contestant with the lowest score is eliminated.</p>
<p>Given the points contestants got from judges, your job is to
    find out, for each contestant, the minimum percentage of
    audience votes he/she must receive in order for him/her to be
    guaranteed not to be eliminated, no matter how the rest of the
    audience’s votes are distributed.</p>
<p>If the lowest score is shared by multiple contestants, no
    contestants will be eliminated.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases follow, one per line.
    Each line starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of contestants,
    followed by a space, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_0, s_1, \ldots , s_{N-1}$</span>,
    separated by single spaces. The integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> is the point value assigned to
    contestant <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> by the
    judges.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing <tt>Case
    #x:</tt> followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    real numbers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_ i$</span>s. The
    value <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is the case
    number (starting from 1). The value <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_ i$</span> is the smallest percentage of
    audience votes required for contestant <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to definitely avoid
    elimination.</p>
<p>Answers within an absolute or relative error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span> of the correct answer will
    be accepted.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq s_ i \leq 100$</span>.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i &gt; 0$</span> for some
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. This means at least
    one contestant will have a point value greater than 0.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 50$</span>.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 200$</span>.</p>
