</div>Purple rain falls in the magic kingdom of Linearland
    which is a straight, thin peninsula.

    <p>On close observation however, Prof. Nelson Rogers finds that
    actually it is a mix of Red and Blue drops.</p>
<p>In his zeal, he records the location and color of the
    raindrops in different locations along the peninsula. Looking
    at the data, Professor Rogers wants to know which part of
    Linearland had the “least” purple rain.</p>
<p>After some thought, he decides to model this problem as
    follows. Divide the peninsula into <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> sections and number them West to
    East from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Then, describe the
    raindrops as a sequence of <tt class="tt">R</tt> and <tt class="tt">B</tt>, depending on whether the rainfall in each section
    is primarily red or blue. Finally, find a subsequence of where
    the difference between the number of <tt class="tt">R</tt> and
    the number of <tt class="tt">B</tt> is maximized.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing a string of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> characters
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 10^5$</span>),
    describing the color of the raindrops in sections <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that the string consists of uppercase ASCII
    letters ‘<tt class="tt">R</tt>’ and ‘<tt class="tt">B</tt>’
    only.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print, on a single line, two space-separated integers that
    describe the starting and ending positions of the part of
    Linearland that had the least purple rain.</p>
<p>If there are multiple possible answers, print the one that
    has the Westernmost (smallest-numbered) starting section. If
    there are multiple answers with the same Westernmost starting
    section, print the one with the Westernmost ending section.</p>
