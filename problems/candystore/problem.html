<div class="problembody">
<p>Candy runs, well, a candy store! It is very popular, she has
    a hard time keeping up with all the orders being placed. She
    implements a simple system. Each customer who enters the store
    will fill their order on a form and sign it with their
    initials.</p>
<p>Maybe she should have asked for their full name instead,
    since this can sometimes lead to ambiguities about who placed
    the order. Actually, maybe she should not have let the
    customers write their own initials because sometimes she might
    misread them.</p>
<p>At times, Candy needs to consult with the customers about
    their order. She calls the initials written on the order form.
    Each time Candy calls out some initials, help her by informing
    her who the initials corresponds to, or if there are multiple
    names the initials correspond to, or if nobody has those
    initials.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input will contain two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le N\le 100$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le Q\le 100$</span>), denoting the number
    of customers in the store who have submitted an order and
    number of initials to query, respectively. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each contain one
    name, which is two words separated by a single space. Each of
    the two words starts with an uppercase letter and is followed
    by lowercase letters. The length of each word is between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> characters. No two of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> customers will have
    the exact same name, though some customers may share the same
    first name or the same last name.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines each
    contains exactly two uppercase letters describing the initials
    of a customer Candy wants to talk to.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>
    queries, output one of the following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If there is exactly one name that matches the initials,
        output the name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is no name that matches, output <tt class="ttfamily">nobody</tt></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If there is more than one name that matches, output
        <tt class="ttfamily">ambiguous</tt></p>
</li>
