<div class="problembody">
<p>Virtually every single book, play, movie, novel, and game
    has at least one character. Most have more, and some even have
    thousands! As every good writer knows, the difficulty of
    creating a character increases with each new major character
    added. This is because fictional characters are truly developed
    through their relationships with others.</p>
<p>If there are no characters or only one character, no
    relationships need to be explored. With two characters, there
    is one relationship. If there are three characters, however,
    there are four relationships: the ones between each pair of
    characters, and finally the relationship when all three are
    together. In general, the relationship between all subsets of
    at least two characters must be explored.</p>
<p>Given a literary work with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> characters, how many relationships
    need to be explored?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq N \leq 30$</span>), the number of characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line with the number of relationships that
    need to be explored.</p>
