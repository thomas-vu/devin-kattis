<div class="problembody">
<p>What are your chances of hitting a fly with a tennis
    racquet?</p>
<p>To start with, ignore the racquet’s handle. Assume the
    racquet is a perfect ring, of outer radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and thickness <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (so the inner radius of the ring
    is <span class="tex2jax_process">$R-t$</span>).</p>
<p>The ring is covered with horizontal and vertical strings.
    Each string is a cylinder of radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>. Each string is a chord of the
    ring (a straight line connecting two points of the circle).
    There is a gap of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> between neighbouring strings. The
    strings are symmetric with respect to the center of the racquet
    i.e. there is a pair of strings whose centers meet at the
    center of the ring.</p>
<p>The fly is a sphere of radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>. Assume that the racquet is moving
    in a straight line perpendicular to the plane of the ring.
    Assume also that the fly’s center is inside the outer radius of
    the racquet and is equally likely to be anywhere within that
    radius. Any overlap between the fly and the racquet (the ring
    or a string) counts as a hit.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>One line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of test cases in the
    input file. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines will each contain the numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> separated by exactly one space.
    Also the numbers will have at most 6 digits after the decimal
    point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, each of the
    form “<tt class="tt">Case #</tt><span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span><tt class="tt">:</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>”, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is the number of the test case and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is the probability of
    hitting the fly with a piece of the racquet. Answers with a
    relative or absolute error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> will be considered
    correct.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<p>Numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> will be positive and smaller or
    equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>. You
    can assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> &lt;
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> &lt; <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> &lt; <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>. Furthermore, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 25$</span> and the total
    number of strings will be at most 2000 (so at most 1000 in each
    direction).</p>
