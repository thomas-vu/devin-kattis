<p>Among the many detrimental consequences of alcohol are the
    unpleasant physiological effects known as a <em>hangover</em>.
    Typical symptoms of a hangover may include headache,
    drowsiness, concentration problems, dry mouth, dizziness,
    fatigue, gastrointestinal distress (<em>e.g.</em>, vomiting,
    diarrhoea), absence of hunger, light sensitivity, depression,
    sweating, nausea, hyper-excitability, irritability, and
    anxiety.</p>
<p>A hangover occurs the day after you were drinking.</p>
<p>According to some traditions, hangovers can be cured by
    alcohol itself. In English, this phenomenon is known as “hair
    of the dog that bit you,” in other languages as the Cure, a
    nail pulling another nail, a reparation beer, Konterbier,
    morning-after-pils, and many other names.</p>
<p>Drinking cancels the hangover that would have occurred from
    drinking the day before.</p>
