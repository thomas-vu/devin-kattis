<p>The mayor of RMRCity wants to create a secure landline
    telephone network for emergency use in case of serious
    disasters when the city is cut off from the outside world. Some
    pairs of buildings in the city can be directly connected with a
    wire telephone line and the municipality engineers have
    prepared an estimate of the cost of connecting any such
    pair.</p>
<p>The mayor needs your help to find the cheapest network that
    connects all buildings in the city and satisfies a particular
    security measure that will be explained shortly. A call from a
    building <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> to another
    building <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> may be routed
    through any simple path in the network (i.e., a path that does
    not have any repeated building). There are also some insecure
    buildings that one or more persons with serious criminal
    records live in. The mayor wants only communications intended
    for these insecure buildings to reach them. In other words, no
    communication from any building <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> to any building <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> should pass through any insecure
    building <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> in the
    network (where <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> is
    different from <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line
    contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1\, 000$</span> is the number of
    buildings, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le m \le 100\,
    000$</span> is the number of possible direct connections
    between a pair of buildings, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le p \le n$</span> is the number of
    insecure buildings. The buildings are numbered from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. The second line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> distinct integers
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (inclusive), which are
    the numbers of insecure buildings. Each of the next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines contains three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell _ i$</span> describing one potential
    direct line, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le x_ i, y_ i \le n)$</span> are the
    distinct buildings the line connects, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell _ i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le \ell _ i \le 10\, 000)$</span> is the
    estimate of the cost of connecting these buildings. There is at
    most one direct link between any two buildings in these
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the cost of the cheapest network satisfying the
    security measure if it is possible. Otherwise, display
    <tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>.</p>
