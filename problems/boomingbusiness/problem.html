<p>You are an expert in bonsai, the Japanese art of cultivating
    small trees in small containers. Every year, you win the Bonsai
    Association’s Pruning Competition (BAPC). With all this talent,
    it would be a shame not to turn your hobby into your job.
    Recently, you have rented a small store where you will sell
    your creations. Now you need to make a window display to draw
    in customers. Of course, you would like to grow the most
    impressive tree that will fit the window, but the window is
    only so tall, and the floor of the display can only bear so
    much weight. Therefore, you want a tree that is exactly so tall
    and so heavy that it can fit in your window.</p>
<p>Being an expert, you know that by definition a bonsai tree
    consists of a single branch, with 0 or more smaller bonsai
    trees branching off from that branch.</p>

<p>The height and weight of a bonsai tree can be carefully
    determined. A tree’s weight is equal to the number of branches
    that appear in it. The weights of the trees in Figure 1 are 1,
    4, 6 and 6, respectively. A tree’s height is equal to the
    length of the longest chain of branches from the root to the
    top of the tree. The heights of the trees in Figure 1 are 1, 2,
    3 and 3, respectively.</p>
<p>To make the most use of your window, you want to produce a
    bonsai tree of the precise height and weight that it can
    support. To get an idea of the number of options available to
    you, you would like to know how many different trees you could
    possibly grow for your store. Given a height and a weight, can
    you determine the number of trees with exactly that height and
    weight? Because the number may be very large, you may give your
    answer modulo 1,000,000,007.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>A single line containing two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq h, w \leq 300$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing a single integer, the number
    of bonsai trees of height <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> and weight <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9+7$</span>.</p>
