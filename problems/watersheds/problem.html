<p>Geologists sometimes divide an area of land into different
    regions based on where rainfall flows down to. These regions
    are called drainage basins.</p>
<p>Given an elevation map (a 2-dimensional array of altitudes),
    label the map such that locations in the same drainage basin
    have the same label, subject to the following rules.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>From each cell, water flows down to at most one of its 4
        neighboring cells.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each cell, if none of its 4 neighboring cells has a
        lower altitude than the current cell’s, then the water does
        not flow, and the current cell is called a sink.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, water flows from the current cell to the
        neighbor with the lowest altitude.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In case of a tie, water will choose the first direction
        with the lowest altitude from this list: North, West, East,
        South.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Every cell that drains directly or indirectly to the same
    sink is part of the same drainage basin. Each basin is labeled
    by a unique lower-case letter, in such a way that, when the
    rows of the map are concatenated from top to bottom, the
    resulting string is lexicographically smallest. (In particular,
    the basin of the most North-Western cell is always labeled
    ‘a’.)</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input file will contain the number of
    maps <span class="tex2jax_process">$T, 1 \le T \le 100$</span>.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> maps will follow, each
    starting with two integers on a line – <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> – the height and width of the map,
    in cells. You can assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le H, W \le 100$</span>. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> lines will each contain a row of
    the map, from north to south, each containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> integers, from west to east,
    specifying the altitudes of the cells. All altitudes are at
    least 0 and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\,
    000$</span>. You can assume that there will be at most 26
    basins.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$1+H$</span> lines. The first line must be of
    the form “Case #<span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>:”,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is the test case
    number, starting from 1. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> lines must list the basin labels
    for each of the cells, in the same order as they appear in the
    input.</p>
