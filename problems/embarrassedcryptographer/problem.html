</div>The young and very promising cryptographer Odd Even has
    implemented the security module of a large system with
    thousands of users, which is now in use in his company. The
    cryptographic keys are created from the product of two primes,
    and are believed to be secure because there is no known method
    for factoring such a product effectively.
    <p>What Odd Even did not think of, was that <em>both</em>
    factors in a key should be large, not just their product. It is
    now possible that some of the users of the system have weak
    keys. In a desperate attempt not to be fired, Odd Even secretly
    goes through all the users keys, to check if they are strong
    enough. He uses his very poweful Atari, and is especially
    careful when checking his boss’ key.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> test cases. Each test case is a
    line with the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$4 \leq K
    \leq 10^{100}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq
    L \leq 10^6$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    is the key itself, a product of two primes. <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> is the wanted minimum size of the
    factors in the key. The input set is terminated by a case where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K = 0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L = 0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each number <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, if
    one of its factors are strictly less than the required
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>, your program should
    output “<tt class="ttfamily">BAD <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span></tt>”, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is the smallest factor in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>. Otherwise, it should
    output “<tt class="ttfamily">GOOD</tt>”. Cases should be
    separated by a line-break.</p>
