<p>Cyanide rivers flowing out from Martian south polar ice cap
    are quite dangerous due to their toxic contents and any
    activity in their close proximity is often extremely time
    consuming.</p>
<p>A row of communication towers has been built in the area,
    before the rivers even appeared after Martian global warming
    events.</p>
<p>Some of the towers are now standing directly in a river,
    some remain standing outside, on the river shores or on islands
    in the rivers. The first and the last tower in the row stand on
    river shores.</p>
<p>All towers are to be officially certified for the next
    operation period in the present difficult conditions.</p>
<p>The towers which are standing on the shore or on an island
    can be certified immediately. The access to the towers in
    rivers is hazardous and requires a lot of caution. The
    certification process of a tower standing in a river takes one
    whole day. Moreover, a tower standing in a river can be
    certified only if at least one of its immediate neighbour
    towers has been certified at least one day earlier.
    Fortunately, the certification process can be performed
    independently on each tower, thus it is possible to certify
    more than one tower in a day.</p>
<p>The certification process has to be completed as soon as
    possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one line containing an odd binary
    number with up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$300\,
    000$</span> digits and with no leading zeros. Each digit
    represents one tower. Towers standing in a river are
    represented by <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>’s, and
    the remaining towers are represented by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>’s. The order of the digits is the
    same as the order of towers in the row.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the minimum number of whole days in which all towers
    can be certified.</p>
