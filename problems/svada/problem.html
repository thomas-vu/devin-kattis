<p>The local zoo has acquired a large open garden in which
    animals may freely move as in their natural habitats and
    entertain visitors with their usual shenanigans.</p>
<p>The most popular animals are monkeys. With their climbing
    and jumping and other skills, they delight old and young
    visitors alike.</p>
<p>One species of monkey has specialized in climbing tall trees
    and picking off coconuts. Another species has specialized in
    breaking them open.</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> monkeys
    of the first type (numbered 1 through <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> monkeys of the second type
    (numbered 1 through <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>).</p>
<p>Monkey <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> of the first
    type takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ k$</span> seconds
    to find a good spot on the tree, after which it picks off its
    first coconut. After that the monkey produces a new coconut
    every <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ k$</span> seconds.</p>
<p>Monkey <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> of the
    second type takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ k$</span>
    seconds to find a good tool for opening the coconuts, after
    which it opens its first coconut. After that the monkey opens
    another coconut every <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_
    k$</span> seconds.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the second type of monkey is extremely
    aggressive so the two types may not be in the garden at the
    same time. Therefore, zoo keepers will chase away the first
    type of monkeys as soon as they have picked off all the
    coconuts. Similarly, if monkeys of the same type stay too long
    after opening all the coconuts, fights will ensue. Because of
    that, zoo keepers will send them away as soon as they have
    opened all the coconuts.</p>
<p>The zoo keepers first arrive immediately after all coconuts
    have been picked, and again immediately after the monkeys open
    them all. The time needed for monkeys to enter or leave the
    garden is also negligibly small.</p>
<p>Tomislav especially likes the second type of monkey, but can
    never guess when to arrive in order to see them. Help him
    calculate the time when the second type arrives if he knows the
    total time that monkeys spent in the garden, but does not know
    the number of coconuts in the garden.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq T \leq 1\, 000\, 000\, 000)$</span>, the total time that
    monkeys spent in the garden, in seconds.</p>
<p>The next line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq N \leq 100)$</span>, the number of monkeys of the first
    type. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ k$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ k$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq A_ k, B_ k \leq 1\, 000\, 000\,
    000)$</span>, how fast monkey <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> of the first type is.</p>
<p>The next line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq M \leq 100)$</span>, the number of monkeys of the second
    type. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ k$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ k$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq C_ k, D_ k \leq 1\, 000\, 000\,
    000)$</span>, how fast monkey <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> of the second type is.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of seconds between the arrival of the
    first type of monkeys and the arrival of the second type.</p>
