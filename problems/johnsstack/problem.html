<div class="problembody">
<p>John has a big stack of books of various sizes. Such a stack
    is stable if the books have non-decreasing sizes (viewed from
    top to bottom); otherwise, it is unstable, and likely to fall
    over.</p>
<p>To prevent this, John wants to sort the books in the stack
    by size. He does so by pulling out a book from somewhere in the
    middle (or bottom) of the stack and then putting it back on
    top. However, he can only pull out a book safely if the books
    on top of it already form a stable stack.</p>
<p>For example, if John has a stack of four books with sizes 3,
    4, 1 and 2 (from top to bottom) then he can sort them as
    follows:</p>

</center>
</div>
<p>Your task is to determine how many steps are required to
    sort a given stack of books. In the example above, which
    corresponds to the first sample case, the answer is 3.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 50$</span>): the number of
        books.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space-separated integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le s_ i \le 1\, 000$</span> for
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i \le n$</span>): the
        sizes of the books, as they appear in the initial stack
        from top to bottom.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with an integer: the minimum number of steps
        required to sort the stack using the algorithm described
        above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
