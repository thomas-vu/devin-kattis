<p>You are attending the International Construction by
    Preschoolers Contest. Unfortunately, you are too old to
    participate, but you still enjoy watching the competition.</p>
<p>In between rounds, you are walking around the contest area
    when you see a toddler, one of the contestants, playing with
    her blocks. Annoyed that she is having all the fun, you decide
    to challenge her to a game.</p>
<p>You set up two stacks of blocks of a certain height. Then,
    you and the toddler take turns removing some number of blocks
    from the stack which contains the largest number of blocks (if
    both stacks have the same number of blocks, the current player
    can choose either stack to remove blocks from). The number of
    blocks removed must be a <em>positive multiple</em> of the
    number of blocks in the smaller stack. For instance, if there
    is a stack with <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>
    blocks, and one with <span class="tex2jax_process">$23$</span>
    blocks, then the current player can remove <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> blocks from the stack of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$23$</span> blocks. The player
    who empties one of the stacks wins the game.</p>
<p>You have graciously decided to take the first move, but then
    a worry strikes you – might this devious preschooler still be
    able to beat you?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>One line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N, M\leq 10^{18}$</span>, the initial
    sizes of the two stacks of blocks.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing a single word: the word
    “<tt class="ttfamily">win</tt>” if you are guaranteed to win if
    you play correctly, and the word “<tt class="ttfamily">lose</tt>” if your opponent can force you to
    lose.</p>
