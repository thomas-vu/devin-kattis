<div class="problembody">
<p>Sam is starting a new company, and has just chosen its name.
    The name is a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s =
    s_1s_2\dots s_ n$</span> of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. The name is so long that
    customers won’t remember the full name. Rather, each customer
    is going to remember only a substring <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> of the full name, and different
    customers may remember different substrings.</p>
<p>Sam is curious how memorable the substring <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> will be to a customer. Sam
    believes that the more palindromes <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> contains, the more memorable it
    is. Recall that a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> is a palindrome if <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> reads the same forwards and
    backwards (for example, the strings <tt class="ttfamily">radar</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">level</tt> are
    palindromes, while the string <tt class="ttfamily">ever</tt> is
    not). After all, customers are sensitive to symmetries in the
    substring <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> that he or
    she remembers, and palindromes are full of symmetries. As such,
    Sam wants to find out the number of substrings <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> of <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> is a palindrome.</p>
<p>The challenge is that Sam’s company will have tons of
    customers. It is difficult for Sam to know how memorable his
    company name is to all these customers. Can you help Sam?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s = s_1s_2 \dots s_ n$</span> consisting of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lowercase letters
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100\,
    000$</span>). The second line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq m \leq 100\, 000$</span>), denoting the number of
    customers. Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
    follow, each containing a pair of integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq \ell \leq r \leq n$</span>), indicating that a customer
    remembers precisely the substring <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_\ell s_{\ell +1} \dots s_ r$</span>
    between the <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span>th and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>th characters
    inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each customer, output a line containing an integer that
    indicates how memorable the company name is to the customer.
    More specifically, if this customer remembers the substring
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_\ell s_{\ell +1} \dots s_
    r$</span>, output the number of pairs of indices <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i,j)$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell \leq i \leq j \leq r$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i s_{i+1} \dots s_ j$</span>
    is a palindrome.</p>
