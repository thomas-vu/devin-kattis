<div class="problembody">
<p>Walter was once a promising chemist. Now he teaches high
    school students chemistry, and was recently diagnosed with lung
    cancer. In both desperation and excitement he decides to use
    his chemistry skills to produce illegal drugs and make quick
    money for his family. He forms a partnership with one of his
    old students, Jesse, who has some experience with the drug
    scene.</p>
<p>Now Walter and Jesse are preparing for their first “cook”
    (the process of making the drugs). They have a list of items
    they need for the cook, but they realized they have to be very
    careful when going to the store. The reason is that it may be
    suspicious to buy certain pairs of items, like cold medicine
    and battery acid, in the same trip.</p>
<p>They decide to divide the items among themselves, so that
    each of them can go one trip to the store and buy their share
    of items without the risk of anyone becoming suspicious. Help
    them find such a division, or tell them that it is not
    possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N &lt; 100\, 000$</span>, the number of items they want to
    buy. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines contain the names of these items, all of which are
    different. A name consists of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> lowercase letters from the
    English alphabet or underscores, and is non-empty. The next
    line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq M &lt; 100\, 000$</span>, the number of pairs of items
    that are considered suspicious when bought together. Then
    follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines, each
    containing the names of two different items that form a
    suspicious pair. Each suspicious pair will be listed exactly
    once.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is possible for Walter and Jesse to divide the items
    among themselves, then output two lines. In the first line
    output the names of the items that Walter should buy. In the
    second line output the names of the items that Jesse should
    buy. If there are multiple solutions, output any of them. If
    this is not possible, output <tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>.</p>
