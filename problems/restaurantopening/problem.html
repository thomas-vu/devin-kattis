<p>It is said that the three most important factors for
    determining whether or not a business will be successful are
    location, location, and location. The Incredible Cooks
    Preparing Cuisine are opening a new restaurant in the
    International City Promoting Cooking, and they have hired you
    to find the optimal location for their restaurant.</p>
<p>You decide to model the city as a grid, with each grid
    square having a specified number of people living in it. The
    distance between two grid squares <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r_1,c_1)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r_2,c_2)$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$|r_1-r_2|+|c_1-c_2|.$</span> In order to
    visit the restaurant, each potential customer would incur a
    cost equal to the minimum distance from the grid square in
    which they live to the grid square containing the proposed
    location of the restaurant. The total cost for a given
    restaurant location is defined as the sum of the costs of
    everyone living in the city to visit the restaurant.</p>
<p>Given the current city layout, compute the minimum total
    cost if the Incredible Cooks Preparing Cuisine select their
    next restaurant location optimally.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    &lt; n,m \le 50$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of rows in the city
    grid and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number
    of columns.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$g_{ij}$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le g_{ij}\le 50$</span>),
    which specifies the number of people living in the grid square
    at row <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, column
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the total cost if the
    restaurant is selected optimally.</p>
