</div>It’s Bill the beekeeper again. In this problem, we learn
    that didn’t choose his career for the best reason. Bill chose
    to be a beekeeper because he really, really likes the look of
    the double e’s in the word “beekeeper”. Your task is to help
    identify other words Bill will really like.

    <p>Bill’s affinity for a word is determined by how many pairs
    of double vowels it has, where vowels are the letters
    {a,e,i,o,u,y}. Given a list of words, find the word that has
    the most pairs of double vowels, as it will be Bill’s favorite
    word.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>It is guaranteed that there will be a unique correct
        answer. That is, one word in the list will have strictly
        more pairs of vowels than all other words in the list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No word in the input will have three or more of the same
        vowel consecutively, because that would just be too much
        for poor Bill.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will contain multiple test cases, up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. The first line of
    each case contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>,
    the number of words in that case (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; N \le 1000$</span>). The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines will contain the
    words that make up that case. Each word will contain only
    lowercase English letters <tt class="ttfamily">[a-z]</tt>, and
    no word will be longer than <span class="tex2jax_process">$80$</span> characters. Words will not
    necessarily be actual English words, but they will contain at
    least one letter. The input will be terminated by a line
    containing a single zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, print Bill’s favorite word. Each output
    should be printed on its own line.</p>
