<p>To determine the efficacy of a vaccine against a disease, a
    clinical trial is needed. Some participants are given the real
    vaccine, while others are given a placebo as the control group.
    The participants are tracked to determine if they are infected
    by three different strains (A, B, and C) of a virus. The
    efficacy of the vaccine against infection by a particular
    strain is simply the percentage reduction of the infection rate
    of the vaccinated group compared to the control group.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span> people in the vaccinated group,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> of which are infected
    by strain B. Then the infection rate is <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>%. Further suppose that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> people are in the
    control group, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span>
    people are infected by strain B. Then the infection rate for
    the control group is <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span>%. Thus the vaccine efficacy
    against infection is approximately <span class="tex2jax_process">$66.67$</span>% (since <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>% is a <span class="tex2jax_process">$66.67$</span>% percentage reduction of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span>%). If the infection
    rate for a particular strain in the vaccinated group is not
    lower than that of the control group, the vaccine is not
    effective against infection by that strain.</p>
<p>What is the vaccine efficacy against infection by the three
    strains?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 10\, 000$</span>) containing the number of
    participants in the clinical trial.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    describe the participants. Each of these lines contains a
    string of length four. Each letter is either ‘Y’ or ‘N’. The
    first letter indicates whether the participant is vaccinated
    with the real vaccine, and the remaining three letters indicate
    whether the participant is infected by strain A, B, and C,
    respectively.</p>
<p>There is at least one participant in the vaccinated group
    and the control group. There is at least one participant in the
    control group infected by each strain (but they may be
    different participants).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the vaccine efficacy against infection by strain A,
    B, and C in that order. If the vaccine is not effective against
    infection by a particular strain, display <tt class="ttfamily">Not Effective</tt> for that strain instead. Answers
    with an absolute error or relative error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-2}$</span> will be
    accepted.</p>
