</div>Penelope is part of the admin team of the newly built
    supercomputer. Her job is to assign workstations to the
    researchers who come here to run their computations at the
    supercomputer.

    <p>Penelope is very lazy and hates unlocking machines for the
    arriving researchers. She can unlock the machines remotely from
    her desk, but does not feel that this menial task matches her
    qualifications. Should she decide to ignore the security
    guidelines she could simply ask the researchers not to lock
    their workstations when they leave, and then assign new
    researchers to workstations that are not used any more but that
    are still unlocked. That way, she only needs to unlock each
    workstation for the first researcher using it, which would be a
    huge improvement for Penelope.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, unused workstations lock themselves
    automatically if they are unused for more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> minutes. After a workstation has
    locked itself, Penelope has to unlock it again for the next
    researcher using it. Given the exact schedule of arriving and
    leaving researchers, can you tell Penelope how many unlockings
    she may save by asking the researchers not to lock their
    workstations when they leave and assigning arriving researchers
    to workstations in an optimal way? You may assume that there
    are always enough workstations available.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 300\, 000$</span>), the
        number of researchers, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 10^8$</span>), the number
        of minutes of inactivity after which a workstation locks
        itself;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each with
        two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a, s \leq 10^8$</span>),
        representing a researcher that arrives after <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> minutes and stays for exactly
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> minutes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum number of unlockings Penelope may save
    herself.</p>
