<div class="problembody">
<p>You just got your new passport, fresh with pages ready to be
    stamped by immigration officers. Sadly, because your passport
    has so many pages, immigration officers are too lazy to try to
    use your pages efficiently, so you may need to get a new
    passport sooner than you think...</p>
<p>You have some trips prepared. For each trip, when you go
    through passport control, the immigration officer will look for
    some contiguous pages, none of which are stamped, and then
    stamp all of them. Because the officer is lazy, there is no
    guarantee which contiguous pages get stamped.</p>
<p>You will start making these trips in order until your
    passport no longer has enough contiguous empty pages to satisfy
    the next trip, at which point you will apply for a new
    passport. Your plans are fixed - you will not skip a trip in
    the middle even if it means you could make more future
    trips.</p>
<p>If the immigration officers conspire against you, find the
    first trip where it is possible you cannot travel because your
    passport does not have enough consecutive blank pages (or if
    you can always make all trips without running out of blank
    pages).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 10^5$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le p \le 10^{18}$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of trips you have
    planned, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is the
    number of pages in your new passport.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le c \le 10^{18}$</span>), which is the number of contiguous
    pages which will need to be stamped for that trip.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the minimum number of
    trips you could possibly take before you would need a new
    passport because there arenâ€™t enough consecutive blank pages
    for your next trip. Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> if you can take all trips, even in
    the worst case.</p>
