<div class="problembody">
<p>Itâ€™s time for a social distancing party! A group of friends
    are sitting around a circular table where some seats are filled
    and some seats are empty. In particular, to maintain social
    distancing protocols, no two people are sitting directly beside
    each other.</p>
<p>They want to expand the party and include more friends, but
    no one is willing to move out of their current seat. Given the
    current table seating, determine the maximum number of
    additional people that can be seated such that there is still
    at least one empty seat between all pairs of people seated.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \leq S \leq 1\, 000$</span>), which is the number of seats at
    the table, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq S/2$</span>),
    which is the number of people that are already seated at the
    table.</p>
<p>Note that the seats of the table are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \ldots , S$</span> in a circular
    fashion: for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i &lt;
    S$</span>, seats numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+1$</span> are directly beside each other.
    Seats <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> are also directly beside each
    other.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_ N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a_1 &lt; a_2 &lt; \cdots
    &lt; a_ N \leq S$</span>), which indicates that seat number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i}$</span> is currently
    occupied. No two occupied seats are directly beside each
    other.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the maximum number of additional friends that can be
    seated at the table such that there is still at least one empty
    seat between all pairs of people seated.</p>
