<p>As chief programmer at a cookie production plant you have
    many responsibilities, one of them being that the cookies
    produced and packaged at the plant adhere to the very demanding
    quality standards of the Nordic Cookie Packaging Consortium
    (NCPC).</p>
<p>At any given time, your production line is producing new
    cookies which are stored in a holding area, awaiting packaging.
    From time to time there are also requests from the packaging
    unit to send a cookie from the holding area to be packaged.
    Naturally, you have programmed the system so that there are
    never any packaging requests sent if the holding area is empty.
    What complicates the matter is the fact that representatives of
    the NCPC might make a surprise inspection to check that your
    cookies are up to standard. Such an inspection consists of the
    NCPC representatives demanding that the next few cookies sent
    to the packaging unit instead be handed over to them; if they
    are convinced that these cookies look (and taste) the same, you
    pass the inspection, otherwise you fail.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the production plant has invested in a new
    measurement thingamajig capable of measuring cookie diameters
    with a precision of 1 nanometre (nm). Since you do not have the
    time to always be on the lookout for cookie craving NCPC
    inspectors, you have decided that a sensible strategy to cope
    with the inspections is to <em>always</em> send a cookie having
    the median diameter among all cookies currently in the holding
    area to the packaging unit on a request. If there is no cookie
    exhibiting the median diameter in the holding area, you instead
    send the smallest cookie larger than the median to the
    packaging unit, hoping it will please the NCPC inspectors. This
    means that, if the cookies were sorted in order of ascending
    diameter, and if there were an odd number <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> of cookies in the holding area,
    you would send the cookie at position <span class="tex2jax_process">$(c+1)/2$</span> in the sorted sequence,
    while if there were an even number <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> of cookies in the holding area,
    you would send the cookie at position <span class="tex2jax_process">$(c/2)+1$</span> in the sorted sequence to
    the packaging unit on a request.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each line of the input contains either a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, indicating that a
    freshly baked cookie with diameter <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> nm has arrived at the holding
    area, or the symbol ’#’, indicating a request from the
    packaging unit to send a cookie for packaging. There are at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$600\, 000$</span> lines of
    input, and you may assume that the holding area is empty when
    the first cookie in the input arrives to the holding area.
    Furthermore, you have read somewhere that the cookie oven at
    the plant cannot produce cookies that have a diameter larger
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> centimetres (cm)
    (or <span class="tex2jax_process">$300\, 000\, 000$</span>
    nm).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A sequence of lines, each indicating the diameter in nm of a
    cookie sent for packaging, in the same order as they are
    sent.</p>
