<p>Rhyming slang involves replacing a common word with a phrase
    of two or three words, the last of which rhymes with the
    original word. For example,</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>replacing the word “stairs” with the rhyming phrase
        “apples and pears”,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>or replacing “rotten” with the phrase “bales of
        cotton”.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>English has such a wide variety of spellings and
    pronunciations that for any non-native speaker telling what
    rhymes isn’t always easy. Perhaps you can help?</p>
<p>Typically, two words rhyme (or can be forced to rhyme) if
    both of their endings can be found on the same list of word
    endings that sound the same.</p>
<p>Given a common word, a number of lists, each containing word
    endings that sound the same, and a number of phrases, determine
    if those phrases could be rhyming slang.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing the single common word <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le |S| \le 20$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le E \le 10$</span>), the number of
        lists of word endings that sound the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> lines, each no
        more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>
        characters long. Each a list of space-separated word
        endings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 10$</span>), the number of
        phrases to test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> lines, each no
        more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>
        characters long, containing a phrase <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> of two or three words that
        might rhyme with the common word.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All words and letters will be in lower case. The common
    word’s ending will appear in at least one ending list.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> lines, each
        consisting of either:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>’<tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt>’: The phrase
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> rhymes with
            the common word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>’<tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt>’: The phrase
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> does not
            rhyme with the common word.</p>
</li>
</ul>
