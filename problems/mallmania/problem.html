<div class="problembody">
<p>Waterloo has two giant shopping malls, each enclosing
    several city blocks. Kim and Pat like to shop and to walk
    within the malls but they don’t like walking between the malls
    because such walking does not contribute directly to the task
    at hand: shopping. They would therefore like to know the
    minimum crossing distance between the malls.</p>
<p>Each city block is a unit square delimited by streets and
    avenues. Streets run east-west and avenues run north-south.
    Both are identified by consecutive integers between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000$</span>. (Lower numbered avenues are
    west of higher numbered avenues and lower numbered streets are
    south of higher numbered streets.) Streets and avenues are
    narrow so their thickness may be assumed to be <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<p>Each mall is a contiguous set of complete city blocks. By
    contiguous we mean that any two blocks are connected by some
    sequence of blocks such that consecutive pairs of blocks in the
    sequence share a side. The malls do not intersect and do not
    surround any empty blocks; that is, the blocks not in any mall
    are themselves contiguous.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Standard input contains several test cases. Each test case
    contains the description of the two malls. Each mall’s
    description consists of an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$p\geq 4$</span>, the perimeter of the mall,
    followed by one or more lines containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> pairs <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a, s)$</span> giving the coordinates of the
    avenue-street intersections contained in the perimeter, in
    clockwise order. A line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> follows the last test case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, output a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> – the minimum walking distance
    between the malls, assuming that Kim and Pat always walk along
    streets and avenues.</p>
