<div class="problembody">
<p>You are running a programming contest that features
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> problems of distinct
    difficulties. You wish to announce ahead of time that the
    problems are ordered in such a way that, if the problems are
    divided into <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> sections
    numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, each with exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{n}{k}$</span> problems,
    and problem <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is
    assigned to section <span class="tex2jax_process">$\left\lceil
    \frac{kp}{n} \right\rceil $</span>, then for every pair of
    sections <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$i &lt; j$</span>, every problem in section
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is easier than every
    problem in section <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.
    Note that <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> must be
    greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and be a
    factor of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>However, you have just sent your problems to the printer so
    the order cannot be changed. For what values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> would this claim be true?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le n \le 50$</span>), which is the number
    of problems.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le d \le n$</span>). These are the difficulties for the
    problems in the order that they appear in the problem set. The
    difficulties are distinct. The problem with difficulty
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is the easiest problem
    and the problem with difficulty <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the hardest problem.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a list of integers, one per line. The integers are
    all valid values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> in
    increasing order. If no such values exist, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
