<p>George has <span class="tex2jax_process">$K \le 20$</span>
    steel wires shaped in the form of half-circles, with radii
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{1}, a_{2}, ...,
    a_{K}$</span>. They can be soldered (connected) at the ends, in
    any angle. Is it possible for George to make a closed shape out
    of these wires? He does not have to use all the wires. The
    wires can be combined at any angle, but may not intersect.
    Beware of floating point errors.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each data set consists of a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; K \le 20$</span> on a line by itself,
    followed by a line of <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    space-separated numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
    i$</span>. Each number is in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; a_ i &lt; 10^7$</span>, and has at
    most 3 digits after the decimal point.</p>
<p>The input will be terminated by a zero on a line by
    itself.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, there should be one word on a line by
    itself; <tt class="ttfamily">"YES"</tt> if it is possible to
    make a simple connected figure out of the given arcs, and
    <tt class="ttfamily">"NO"</tt> if it isnâ€™t.</p>
