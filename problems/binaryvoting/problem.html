<div class="problembody">
<p>Binary Town is holding its biennial elections. All
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> positions on its
    council are open, and as usual Notnomde and Yraglac are the
    only ones running for each position.</p>
<p>Having long since abandoned quaint majority voting, Binary
    Town uses binary voting instead. In binary voting, all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> voters can cast any
    number of ballots, or not vote at all. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$k^\mathrm {th}$</span> least significant
    bits of the total number of ballots are then used to determine
    which candidate wins each position. That is, Notnomde wins
    position <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> if the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^\mathrm {th}$</span> least
    significant bit of the total number of ballots is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, otherwise Yraglac wins.</p>
<p>You know your neighbours well, and know exactly how many
    ballots <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> each one
    will cast if they choose to vote. For some reason, not everyone
    is happy with the electoral system so not everyone votes.
    Thankfully, you also know the probability <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> of each citizen voting.</p>
<p>Since you like Yraglac more than Notnomde, you want to cast
    the number of ballots which maximizes the expected number of
    positions held by Yraglac.</p>
<p>Suppose there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$k =
    2$</span> positions and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v =
    2$</span> voters, and you know with <span class="tex2jax_process">$50\% $</span> probability that the voter
    other than yourself will cast one ballot. If you cast one
    ballot, the total number of ballots could be <span class="tex2jax_process">$01_2$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$10_2$</span> with equal probability, so the
    expected number of positions for Yraglac is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. If you cast two ballots, the
    total number of ballots could be <span class="tex2jax_process">$10_2$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$11_2$</span> with equal probability, making
    Yraglac’s expected number of positions <span class="tex2jax_process">$1.5$</span>. In this case, you then decide
    to cast two ballots since that maximizes Yraglac’s expected
    number of positions.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq 16$</span>, the
    number of positions, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq
    v \leq 100$</span>, the number of voters (including yourself).
    It is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$v - 1$</span>
    lines, each containing two space-separated numbers: a decimal
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq p_ i \leq 1$</span>, the
    probability of voter <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    casting ballots, and an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq b_ i \leq 2^ k - 1$</span>, the
    number of ballots voter <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> would cast should they vote.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output on a single line the number of ballots <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq b_ v \leq 2^ k - 1$</span> you should
    cast to maximize the expected number of positions held by
    Yraglac. The answer is guaranteed to be unique.</p>
