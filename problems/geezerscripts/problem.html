<div class="problembody">
<p>The other day Unnar was playing the video game <em>Geezer
    Scripts</em>, <em>Geezer Scripts V</em> to be precise. He
    opened a door (in the game) and before he knew he was in a
    large and complicated cave-system, full of enemies who will
    attack as soon as Unnar gets to close to them. What’s worse is
    that the game doesn’t remember which enemies the player has
    already defeated so if the player leaves and comes back again
    the enemy will have respawned. Since Unnar is quite prone to
    getting lost he needs your help to find a way through the cave
    which incurs minimal damage to him.</p>
<p>Unnar’s character has some <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> attack points and <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> health points. The same is true
    for his enemies. When Unnar fights an enemy Unnar goes first.
    He subtracts his attack points from the enemies health points
    and the enemy then does the same. This process is repeated
    until either Unnar or the enemy has fewer than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> health points. The loser is the
    one who ran out of health points. If Unnar loses it’s <em>Game
    Over</em>, but if Unnar wins he can continue traversing the
    cave-system but his lost health points do not regenerate.</p>
<p>The cave-system is not evenly elevated so its passages are
    one-way. The cave-system can be modelled using <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> areas connected with <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> one-way passages. Unnar starts in
    area <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and wants to get
    to area <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Every passage
    contains an enemy but the areas are safe.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq A, H \leq 10^9$</span>
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> denotes Unnar’s
    attack points and <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> his
    health points. The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n, m \leq 10^5$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of ares
    in the cave and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> the
    number of passages. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines contain four integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq e_ i, b_ i \leq n$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a_ i, h_ i \leq
    10^9$</span>, indicating a passage from area <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_ i$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> whose enemy has <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> attack points and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_ i$</span> health points.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If Unnar can’t get through the cave-system output ‘Oh no’,
    without the quotes. Otherwise output the maximum health Unnar
    can have after getting through the cave-system.</p>
