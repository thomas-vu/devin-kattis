<div class="problembody">
<p>You are a busy little bee, and you have a problem. After
    collecting nectar all day long, you are returning to the
    beehive with a large supply of honey. You would really like to
    take a nap now, but sadly, you have to store all the honey in
    your beehive first. Opening up a cell in the hive to funnel
    honey into takes a lot of time, so you want to avoid doing this
    as much as possible.</p>
<p>Some of the cells in the beehive are already filled with
    old, hardened honey. The other cells are still empty. If you
    pour honey into an empty cell, it automatically starts flowing
    into adjacent empty cells. From these cells, the honey again
    flows to other neighbouring empty cells, and so on. This saves
    you from having to funnel honey into them directly. You decide
    to use this to your advantage, by pouring into cells with lots
    of (indirect) adjacent open cells.</p>

<p>You have some units of honey, and know the layout of your
    beehive. By cleverly choosing which cells to funnel honey into,
    what is the minimal amount of work you have to do?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The input starts with three integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq h \leq 10^6$</span>, the amount
        of honey you have, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
        \leq n, m \leq 10^3$</span>, the dimensions of the
        grid.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        lines, one for each row of the grid. Each row has
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> symbols, either
        <tt>.</tt>, representing an empty cell, or <tt>#</tt>,
        representing a filled cell. These symbols are separated by
        spaces. Furthermore, every second row starts with a space,
        as these are slightly offset to the right.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The grid always has enough open cells to store all your
    honey.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the number of cells you have to
    funnel honey into directly to store all your honey in the
    hive.</p>
