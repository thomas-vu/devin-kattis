<p>The Impressively Calculable Pyrotechnics Company has been
    contracted to provide certain stage effects for a rock
    festival. In particular, fire is requested (because fire makes
    the crowd go wild). In order to pull this off, the main stage
    is outfitted with a series of tubes, each specially calibrated
    to deliver a flame burst of a particular luminosity. In all,
    there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$18$</span> numbered
    tubes arranged on the stage as follows:</p>

<div class="caption">

        </div>
</center>
</div>
<p>Tube <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, when
    fired, produces a luminosity of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. More generally, the luminosity
    produced by Tube <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (when <span class="tex2jax_process">$N &gt; 1$</span>) is
    double the luminosity produced by Tube <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span>.</p>
<p>To achieve a specific luminosity, multiple tubes can be
    activated to fire simultaneously. The luminosity achieved is
    the sum of the individual luminosities of the activated tubes
    when fired. The total luminosity is represented by a single
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>. The software
    used to control the system accepts the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> as an input argument, and
    determines which tubes need to be activated to achieve that
    luminosity (and which remain deactivated).</p>

<p>The design of the system ensures that a given <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>-value</span> can be achieved by
    firing a unique set of activated tubes. While the system under
    normal conditions can precisely generate the expected
    luminosity, it will occasionally encounter technical problems
    (sticky valves, clogged tubes, etc.) that temporarily prevent
    it from firing a particular requested set of tubes, so it can
    activate and deactivate tubes to fire a different set.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows two groups of tubes that have two
    differences: Tube <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>
    is activated on the left and deactivated on the right, while
    Tube <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> is
    deactivated on the left and activated on the right.</p>

    Tube <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> is
    activated in the group on the right to produce an <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>-value</span> of <span class="tex2jax_process">$45\, 905$</span>:</p>

</div>
<p>During the course of designing the stage effects, the
    producers of the rock festival have been made aware of possible
    technical issues that require the state of the tubes to be
    changed, resulting in an <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>-value</span>
    that is different than what was originally planned. This will
    be OK, as long as the tube states can be quickly adjusted, and
    is brighter than the original <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>-value</span>.
    Because they are obsessed with micromanagement, the producers
    will provide a list of <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>-value</span>s
    they have scheduled for the show, and they request a report be
    generated that provides, for each original value given, the
    count of all alternative <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>-value</span>s
    that meet the following 3 requirements:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>The alternate <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>-value</span> must be greater
        than the original <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>-value</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The alternate <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>-value</span> must be another
        value in the given list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The alternate <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>-value</span> must be achieved
        by changing no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> tube states from the
        original.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The requested <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>-values will be indicated, one per
    line in increasing order, such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq L \leq 250\, 000$</span> for each
    <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>-value</span>. A single
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> will appear on the
    last line to signify the end of input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each original <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>-value</span>,
    in the order given, output a line of the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>:<span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> where integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> is the original requested
    luminosity value, and integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> is the quantity of alternative
    values meeting the 3 requirements given above.</p>
<p>Note: some strategies may produce correct results, but will
    not finish in the allotted time; a time-efficient solution is
    critical.</p>
