<div class="problembody">
<p>Bobby has just joined a new company, and human resources has
    asked him to note his birthday on the office calendar. Bobby
    the Birthday Boy wants to feel special! Also, Bobby the
    Birthday Boy does not mind lying for attention.</p>
<p>He notices that the longer people have not celebrated a
    birthday or eaten cake, the more they like it when a new one
    comes around. So he wants to pick his birthday in such a way
    that the longest period of time without a birthday possible has
    just passed. Of course he does not want to share his birthday
    with any colleague, either.</p>
<p>Can you help him make up a fake birthday to make him feel as
    special as possible? Bobby does not care about leap years: you
    can assume every year is not a leap year, and that no one has a
    birthday on the 29th of February. In case of a tie, Bobby
    decides to fill in the date that is soonest (<em>strictly</em>)
    after the current date, the 27th of October, because that means
    he will get to celebrate his birthday as soon as possible.</p>
