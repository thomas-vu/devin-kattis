<div class="problembody">
<p>In a rainforest there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> treehouses high in the forest
    canopy on different trees (numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>). The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th treeâ€™s location is at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i, y_ i)$</span>. The first
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> of them in the list
    are close enough to neighboring open land around the rainforest
    so that transportation between all of them is easy by foot.
    Some treehouses may already be connected by direct straight
    cables through the air that can allow transport between
    them.</p>
<p>Residents want easy transportation between all the
    treehouses and the open land, by some combination of walking
    (between those near the open land), and using one or more
    cables between treehouses. This may require the addition of
    more cables. Since the cables are expensive, they would like to
    add the smallest possible length of cable.</p>
<p>The height of a cable up two trees can be set so cables can
    criss-cross other cables, and not allow any snags or crashes.
    It is not safe to try to switch between two criss-crossed
    cables in mid-air!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will start with the three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le e \le n$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le p \le 1\, 000$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is the number of cables in place
    already.</p>
<p>Next come <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines,
    each with two real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$|x|, |y| \le 10\, 000$</span>) giving the
    location of a treehouse. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th coordinate pair is for the
    treehouse with ID <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. All
    coordinate pairs are unique. Real numbers are stated as
    integers or include one digit after a decimal point.</p>
<p>Next come <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> lines,
    each with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a &lt; b \le n$</span>, giving the two
    treehouse ids of an existing cable between their trees. No ID
    pair will be repeated.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output is the minimum total length of new cable that
    achieves the connection goal, expressed with absolute or
    relative error less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.001$</span>.</p>
