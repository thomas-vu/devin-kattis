<div class="problembody">
<p>Scott wants to ride his bike along a straight road. But the
    road has some barricades! Scott will ride his bike up to the
    first barricade and stop.</p>
<p>Model Scott’s straight road as the positive <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> axis, with Scott starting at the
    origin. The barricades are line segments, specified by their
    endpoints. Determine how far Scott can ride, or if his path is
    completely unobstructed.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1,000$</span>), which is the
    number of barricades.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-100 \le x1,y1,x2,y2 \le 100$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x1 \ne 0$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x2 \ne 0$</span>), representing a barricade
    that runs from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x1,y1)$</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x2,y2)$</span>. It is
    guaranteed that no barricade will run through the origin.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single real number, which is how far Scott can ride
    before he hits the closest barricade, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1.0$</span> if no barricades get in Scott’s
    way. This output will be considered correct if it is within an
    absolute or relative error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-2}$</span>.</p>
