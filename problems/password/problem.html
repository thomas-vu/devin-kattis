</div>We all know that passwords are not very secure unless
    users are disciplined enough to use passwords that are
    difficult to guess. But most users are not so careful, and
    happily use passwords such as “123456”. In fact, there are
    lists of commonly used passwords that hackers can use for
    breaking into systems, and these passwords often work.

    <p>You have done a lot of hacking using such lists, and you
    have a good idea of how likely each password in the list is the
    correct one (you are very surprised by the number of people
    using “123456” as their passwords). You have a new account to
    hack, and you have decided to try each of the passwords in the
    list one at a time, until the correct one is found. You are
    absolutely sure that the account you want to hack uses a
    password in the given list.</p>
<p>What is the expected number of attempts to find the correct
    passwords, assuming that you try these passwords in the optimal
    order?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of
    passwords in the list. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines gives the password, followed
    by a space, followed by the probability that the password is
    the correct one. Each password consists only of alphanumeric
    characters and is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> characters long. Each
    probability is a real number with <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> decimal places. You may assume
    that there are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span> passwords in the list, and that
    the sum of all probabilities equals <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. No two passwords in the list are
    the same.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output on a single line the expected number of attempts to
    find the correct passwords using the optimal order. Answers
    within <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span> of the
    correct answer will be accepted.</p>
