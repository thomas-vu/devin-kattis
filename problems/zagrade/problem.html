<p>Mirko was bored at his chemistry class, so he played Bomb
    Switcher on his cell phone. Unfortunately, he was spotted and
    was given a ridiculously heavy assignment for homework. For a
    given valid math expression with brackets, he must find all
    different expressions that can be obtained by removing valid
    pairs of brackets from the original expression. Two expressions
    are different if there is a character at which they differ.</p>
<p>For example, given <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2+(2*2)+2)$</span>, one can get
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2+2*2+2)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2+(2*2)+2$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2+2*2+2$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2+2*2)+2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2+(2*2+2)$</span> can’t be reached, since we
    would have to remove pairs of brackets that are not valid. More
    than one pairs of brackets can surround the same part of the
    expression.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains one valid
    mathematical expression composed of nonnegative integers, basic
    arithmetic operations denoted with characters ‘+’, ‘*’, ‘-’ and
    ‘/’, and brackets ‘(’ and ‘)’.</p>
<p>Given expression doesn’t have more than 200 characters, and
    will have at least one, and no more than 10 pairs of brackets.
    Each expression is guaranteed to have at least one pair of
    brackets.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output all different expressions that can be obtained by
    removing valid pairs of brackets, sorted lexicographically.</p>
