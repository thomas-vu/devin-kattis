<p>Against her wishes, Rainbow Dash was put in charge of coach
    the buckball halftime cheerleading squad. While she doesn’t
    have the slightest care for cheerleading (she’d much rather
    coach the team), she’s determined to give it her all to show
    everypony in the squad how much she cares about them.</p>

<p>One of the most important things in cheerleading is
    regulating the crowd’s <i class="itshape">level of
    enthusiasm</i>. By instructing the squad to execute different
    cheers, she can raise or lower this level; for example, less
    lively cheers temper the level of enthusiasm, while other, more
    exciting cheers raise it.</p>
<p>At the beginning, the crowd’s level of enthusiasm is zero.
    To prime the crowd for the second half of the game, she wants
    the level of enthusiasm after all the cheers to be <i class="itshape">exactly</i> <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>.
    Note that it is possible for the crowd’s level of enthusiasm to
    dip below zero or exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> in between the cheers.</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N+1$</span> cheers
    at Rainbow Dash’s disposal. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span> of these cheers changes
    the level of enthusiasm by <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_
    i$</span>, and has a level of difficulty <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ i$</span>—a higher difficulty requires
    more practice and is harder to execute correctly. The first of
    these cheers is always a standard cheer with <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_1 = 1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_1 = 1$</span>; the other <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> non-standard cheers are possibly
    more complicated.</p>
<p>Help Rainbow Dash plan out a sequence of cheers such that
    the crowd’s level of enthusiasm after all the cheers is exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>. Note that the same
    cheer can be executed multiple times, and the order of the
    cheers can be rearranged as necessary; moreover, the existence
    of the standard cheer ensures that this goal is always
    attainable.</p>
<p>Among all such sequences, she wants the total level of
    difficulty to be minimized in order to reduce the amount of
    practice the squad will need—time is of the essence and we need
    to make the most use of it. If a cheer appears multiple times
    in the sequence, its level of difficulty must be included in
    the total that many times.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq N \leq 500$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq T \leq 200\, 000$</span>), the number of non-standard
    cheers at Rainbow Dash’s disposal and the required level of
    enthusiasm, respectively.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines of
    input contain the descriptions of the non-standard cheers. In
    particular, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text
    {th}$</span> of these lines contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_{i+1}$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-T \leq S_{i+1} \leq T$</span>) and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_{i+1}$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq D_{i+1} \leq 10^9$</span>), denoting
    that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i+1)^\text
    {th}$</span> cheer changes the level of enthusiasm by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_{i+1}$</span> and has a level
    of difficulty of <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_{i+1}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>On the first line, output a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, the number of cheers in the
    sequence.</p>
<p>On the second line, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_1, d_2, \dots , d_ c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d_ i \leq N+1$</span>), denoting the
    cheers the squad should execute. In particular, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span> cheer the
    squad should execute is the <span class="tex2jax_process">${d_
    i}^\text {th}$</span> one. This sequence of cheers should
    satisfy the stipulated requirements, and, among all such
    sequences of cheers, have the minimum total level of
    difficulty.</p>
<p>If there are multiple correct answers, you can output any of
    them.</p>
<p>The input will be such that a solution exists with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c \leq 200\, 000$</span>.</p>
