<p>In his memoir “So, Anyway”, comedian John Cleese writes of
    the class difference between his father (who was
    “middle-middle-middle-lower-middle class” and his mother (who
    was “upper-upper-lower-middle class”). These fine distinctions
    between classes tend to confuse North American readers, so you
    are to write a program to sort a group of people by their
    classes to show their true place in the social class
    hierarchy.</p>
<p>For this problem, there are three main classes: upper,
    middle, and lower. Obviously, the highest is upper and the
    lowest is lower. But there can be distinctions within a class,
    so upper-upper is a higher class than middle-upper, which is
    higher than lower-upper. However, all of the upper classes
    (upper-upper, middle-upper, and lower-upper) are higher than
    any of the middle classes.</p>
<p>Within a class like middle-upper, there can be further
    distinctions as well, leading to classes like
    lower-middle-upper-middle-upper. When comparing classes, once
    you have reached the lowest level of detail, you should assume
    that all further classes are the same as the middle level of
    the previous level of detail. So upper class and middle-upper
    class are equivalent, as are middle-middle-lower-middle and
    lower-middle.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(T \leq 500)$</span> indicating the number
    of cases to follow. Each case starts with a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(n \leq 100)$</span> on a line indicating
    the number of people to consider. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contains the name of a
    person followed by a colon and a space, followed by the class
    of the person. The name contains up to 30 lowercase characters.
    The class is a string consisting of a nonempty sequence of up
    to 10 of the words <tt>upper</tt>, <tt>middle</tt>,
    <tt>lower</tt> separated by hyphens (<tt>-</tt>), followed by a
    space, followed by the word <tt>class</tt>. No two people will
    have the same name in a single case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print the list of names from highest to
    lowest class. If two people have the same or equivalent
    classes, they should be listed in alphabetical order by name.
    Output a line of 30 equal signs (<tt>=</tt>) after each
    case.</p>
