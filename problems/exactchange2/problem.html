<li>
<p>Seller: That will be fourteen dollars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Buyer: Here’s a twenty.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>When travelling to remote locations, it is often helpful to
    bring cash, in case you want to buy something from someone who
    does not accept credit or debit cards. It is also helpful to
    bring a variety of denominations in case the seller does not
    have change. Even so, you may not have the exact amount, and
    will have to pay a little bit more than full price. The same
    problem can arise even in urban locations, for example with
    vending machines that do not return change.</p>
<p>Of course, you would like to minimize the amount you pay
    (though you must pay at least as much as the value of the
    item). Moreover, while paying the minimum amount, you would
    like to minimize the number of coins or bills that you pay
    out.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer specifying the
    number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a
    line containing an integer, the price in cents of the item you
    would like to buy. The price will not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span> cents (i.e., $100). The
    following line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of bills and coins
    that you have. The number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is at most 100.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    each contain one integer, the value in cents of each bill or
    coin that you have. Note that the denominations can be any
    number of cents; they are not limited to the values of coins
    and bills that we usually use in Canada. However, no bill or
    coin will have a value greater Than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span> cents ($100). The total
    value of your bills and coins will always be equal to or
    greater than the price of the item.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing two
    integers: the total amount paid (in cents), and the total
    number of coins and bills used.</p>
