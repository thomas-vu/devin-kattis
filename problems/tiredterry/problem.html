<div class="problembody">
<p>Terry is feeling tired and he suspects it is because of a
    lack of sleep. He created a device that records his sleeping
    pattern over a period of time measured in seconds.</p>
<p>Assuming that the recorded sleeping pattern keeps repeating,
    help Terry by letting him know how often he is tired during
    each of the repeating time periods.</p>
<p>More precisely, for integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, we say that Terry is tired at
    second <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> if from second
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i-p+1$</span> to second
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (inclusive) he has
    slept for less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>
    seconds.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 86\, 400$</span>), the length of Terryâ€™s sleep
    pattern, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p \leq n$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq d \leq p$</span>) as described above.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains a single string of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> which describes the
    period of time that is recorded. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> such character is a
    <tt class="ttfamily">W</tt> if Terry is awake at the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> second,
    or is a <tt class="ttfamily">Z</tt> if Terry is asleep at the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span>
    second.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display a single integer which represents the number of
    seconds that Terry is tired during each of the repeating time
    periods.</p>
