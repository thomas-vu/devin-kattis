<div class="problembody">
<p>Goran has five wooden pieces arranged in a sequence. There
    is a number between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> inscribed on every
    piece, so that every number appears on exactly one of the five
    pieces. Goran wants to order the pieces to form the sequence
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, 3, 4, 5$</span> and does
    it like this:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>If the number on the first piece is greater than the
        number on the second piece, swap them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the number on the second piece is greater than the
        number on the third piece, swap them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the number on the third piece is greater than the
        number on the fourth piece, swap them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the number on the fourth piece is greater than the
        number on the fifth piece, swap them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the pieces don’t form the sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, 3, 4, 5$</span>, go to
        step 1.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Write a program that, given the initial ordering of the
    pieces, outputs the ordering after each swap.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains five integers separated by single
    spaces, the ordering of the pieces. The numbers will be between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> (inclusive) and there will be no
    duplicates. The initial ordering will not be <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, 3, 4, 5$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>After any two pieces are swapped, output the ordering of the
    pieces, on a single line separated by spaces.</p>
