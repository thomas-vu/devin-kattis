<div class="problembody">
<p>When doing competitive programming, one can sometimes fall
    into an almost trance-like state. Minutes becomes hours, hours
    becomes days, and suddenly you don’t even know for how many
    days you have been programming! Of course, this just became
    another problem for you to solve by writing programs. By
    looking at the current time with intervals of less than an
    entire day, you can always compute the current date, relative
    to some starting date.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Your task is to write a program in C++ that supports two
    operations:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">void lookAtClock(int hours, int
        minutes)</tt> – take a report on the current time in
        24-hour format (i.e. <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le
        hours &lt; 24$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
        \le minutes &lt; 60$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">int getDay()</tt> – return the
        number of days that you have been programming.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Before the first call to any function, it is 00:00 on day
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. When <tt class="ttfamily">getDay</tt> is called, assume that it is called
    immediately after the last invocation to <tt class="ttfamily">lookAtClock</tt>, so that the number of days is the
    same on the two calls.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that the function <tt class="ttfamily">lookAtClock</tt> is called at least once every
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$23$</span> hours and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$59$</span> minutes. Thus, the
    first call will always be a time on day <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. At least 1 minute will have
    elapsed between calls too. The two functions will together be
    called at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>
    times.</p>
<h2>Template</h2>
<p>You can use the template in <tt class="ttfamily">countingdays.cpp</tt> from the Attachments menu when
    implementing your program. When submitting your code, send in
    <em>only this file</em>.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>First, download the file <tt class="ttfamily">countingdays.h</tt> from the Attachments menu and
    save it in the same place as your solution. That file calls
    your program with a fixed test case and reports whether it was
    correct.</p>
