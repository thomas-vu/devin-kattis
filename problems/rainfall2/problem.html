<div class="problembody">
<p>Rainfall is measured in millimeters. The rain is collected
    in a vertical transparent tube with millimeter markings, and
    once the rain has stopped falling, one can check the height of
    the water in the tube.</p>
<p>In our problem, the tube unfortunately has a leak at height
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> millimeters (mm). If
    the water level is above the leak then water drains from the
    tube at a rate of <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    millimeters per hour (mm/h).</p>
<p>We want to figure out how much rain fell during a particular
    rainfall. <i class="itshape">We assume that the tube is high
    enough that it does not overflow. We also assume that rain
    falls at an (unknown) uniform rate during a rainfall, and that
    water does not evaporate from the tube. The height of the leak
    itself is also negligible.</i></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a line with five positive numbers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_1$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_2$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> where</p>
<dl class="description">
<dt><span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>is where the leak is (mm)</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>is the rate at which water leaks (mm/h)</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="tex2jax_process">$T_1$</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>is the duration of the rainfall (h)</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="tex2jax_process">$T_2$</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>is the time between the end of the rainfall and the
        observation of the water level (h)</p>
</dd>
<dt><span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>is the water level in the tube when we observe it
        (mm)</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Each number is at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.01$</span> and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000.00$</span>, and each is given with
    exactly two decimals.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>One line with two floating point numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_1$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_2$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_1$</span> is the smallest rainfall in
    millimeters that would result in the given observation, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_2$</span> is the largest
    rainfall in millimeters that would result in the given
    observation. Values with either absolute or relative error
    smaller than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> are
    acceptable.</p>
