<div class="problembody">
<p>In target practice you sometimes shoot at cardboard figures.
    In this problem a target is described by a simple polygon which
    is the outline of the target. For each target you will find out
    where a number of shots fired at the target struck. Some may
    have hit the target and some may have missed. Your job is to
    determine for each shot whether it hit or whether it missed. If
    the shot missed, you should determine how far away from the
    target the shot was. If the shot hit, you should determine how
    large a margin there was, i.e., how far away from the contour
    of the target the shot was.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each test case starts with a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le n \le 1000$</span> which is the number
    of vertices of the target polygon (in clockwise or counter
    clockwise order). Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines giving the coordinates
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> of each vertex. Then follows a
    line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$s \le
    100$</span> which is the number of shots fired at that target.
    Finally, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
    lines giving the coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> of each shot. Coordinates are
    integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\,
    000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>
    inclusive.</p>
<p>The final test case is followed by a line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=0$</span>. There are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> test cases.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output “<tt class="ttfamily">Case
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span></tt>” where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is the number of the
    test case. Then follows a line for every shot fired at the
    target. For each shot, if it missed, print “<tt class="ttfamily">Miss! <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span></tt>”
    and if it hit, print “<tt class="ttfamily">Hit! <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span></tt>” where <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is the distance mentioned above.
    If a shot hits the edge of the target, print “<tt class="ttfamily">Winged!</tt>”. The distance should be given with an
    absolute error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span>.</p>
