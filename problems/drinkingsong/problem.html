<p><em>Ninety-Nine Bottles of Beer</em> is an anonymous folk
    song dating to the mid-20th century. It is a traditional
    reverse counting song, sometimes used to sing on long trips, as
    it has a very repetitive format which is easy to memorize and
    can take a long time to sing. The lyrics describe a quantity of
    bottles that is reduced by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> in every verse, until no bottles
    are left, at which point the song ends somewhat abruptly.</p>
<p>Many variations and similar songs are known in other
    languages.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of exactly two lines. On the first line,
    the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> of bottles
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N\leq 99$</span>. On the
    second line, a single word of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> lower- or uppercase characters
    from the English alphabet, not using whitespace, describing a
    beverage.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The full lyrics of the song, starting with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, and counting down until the last
    bottle gets taken. The lyrics are given by example below. Note
    the grammatical changes in the last two verses.</p>
