<p>Ms. Greene is trying to design a game for her third-grade
    class to practice their addition, subtraction, multiplication,
    and division. She would like for every student in her class to
    be able to “think mathematically” and determine if any two
    given numbers can be added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided
    in any way to produce a third given number. However, she would
    like to be able to check her students’ work quickly without
    having to think about it herself.</p>
<p>Help Ms. Greene by writing a program that inputs two given
    numbers and determines whether or not it is possible to add,
    subtract, multiply, or divide those two numbers in any order to
    produce the third number. Only one operation may be used to
    produce the third number.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input file will start with a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 10\, 000$</span>) denoting the
    number of test cases. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines will contain sets of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a, b, c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a, b, c \le 10\, 000$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, determine whether or not it is possible
    to produce the third number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, using the first two numbers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, using addition, subtraction,
    multiplication, or division.</p>
