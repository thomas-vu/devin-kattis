<p>The level of corruption in some countries is really high. It
    is hard to imagine that these unethical manners have already
    hit the academic field. Some rumors are spreading that some
    students tried to bribe their lecturers to get better grades.
    Would you believe it?</p>
<p>But the real situation may be even much worse. ACM has a
    very strong suspicion that somebody has bribed mathematicians
    in the Academy of Sciences in order to forge some of their
    results. In particular, it is suspected that a very influential
    person wants to prefer some prime numbers over others.</p>
<p>It is said that many mathematicians have already completely
    stopped using some primes and they create only those numbers
    that can be “assembled” without those primes. Your task is to
    verify this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Given a set of prime numbers, your program should output all
    integer numbers that can be created solely by multiplying these
    primes, without using any other primes.</p>
<h2>Input Specification</h2>
<p>The input will consist of several test scenarios. Each
    scenario starts by a line with a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N\leq 10$</span>) – the number of
    primes in the set.</p>
<p>On the second line of a scenario, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integer numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq P_1 &lt; P_2 &lt; P_3 &lt; \dots &lt;
    P_ N &lt; 10000$</span>, separated by a space. You are
    guaranteed that all these numbers are prime.</p>
<p>On the third line of each scenario, there are 2 integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq X\leq Y &lt;2^{31}$</span>), separated
    by a space.</p>
<p>The last scenario is followed by a line containing a single
    zero.</p>
<h2>Output Specification</h2>
<p>Your task is to print all positive integer numbers in the
    closed interval <span class="tex2jax_process">$[X,Y]$</span>
    that have no other prime factors than those given in the input
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span>). Print all such
    numbers in the increasing order, with no duplicates and
    separated by a single comma character (“<tt>,</tt>”). If there
    are no such numbers, print the word “<tt>none</tt>”
    instead.</p>
<p>Note that the number 1 does not need any primes to be
    constructed and is therefore always allowed.</p>
