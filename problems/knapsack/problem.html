<div class="problembody">
<p>Implement a solution to the classic knapsack problem. You
    are given a knapsack that can hold up to a certain weight (its
    capacity), and several items you may choose to put in the
    knapsack. Each item has a weight and a value. Choose a subset
    of the items (which could be all of them, or none of them)
    having the greatest value that fit into the knapsack (i.e. the
    sum of the weights of the items you choose must be less than or
    equal to the knapsack capacity).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> test cases. Each test case begins
    with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le C \le 2\,
    000$</span>, giving the capacity of the knapsack, and an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 2\,
    000$</span>, giving the number of objects. Then follow
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each giving the
    value and weight of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> objects. Both values and weights
    are integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing the number of
    items chosen, followed by a line containing the indices of the
    chosen items (the first item has index <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, the second index <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and so on). The indices can be
    given in any order.</p>
