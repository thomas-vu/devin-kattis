<div class="problembody">
<p>After Borko’s second plan of taking over the village fell
    through (because Mirko’s brother Stanko drank all the water),
    young Zvonko decided to relax with sports. For this purpose he
    stocked up on carrot juice and peanuts, and dived onto the
    couch, ready to watch the next tennis match on television.</p>
<p>While the two players are warming up, their statistics pop
    up on the screen. Zvonko noticed that the match history of the
    players contained invalid results. He had a brilliant idea
    where you write him a program that checks the validity of
    results, which he will then sell to the record keepers and
    enjoy a leisurely life.</p>
<p>A tennis match consists of sets, each set consisting of
    games. The following rules apply:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>A player wins a set if he has <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> or more games and at least two
        games more than his opponent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Additionally, if the result is <span class="tex2jax_process">$6:6$</span> in the first or second set
        (but not the third set), a single final game is played to
        determine the winner of the set (the tie-break game).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The match ends when either player has won 2 sets. That
        player is the winner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A match result is valid if a match could have been played by
    the above rules and ended in the result. Additionally, if one
    of the players is Roger Federer (designated as “<tt class="tt">federer</tt>” in the input), then a result in which he has
    lost a set can’t be valid (Zvonko knows Federer is from outer
    space).</p>
<p>Write a program that checks the validity of all matches
    between two players.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the names of the two
    players separated by a single space. Both names will be strings
    of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> lowercase
    letters of the English alphabet. The names will be different.
    The second line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq N \leq 50)$</span>, how many matches the two players have
    played.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains the result of a
    single match, composed of the results of a number of sets
    separated by single spaces. Each match result will contain
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> sets. A set is given
    in the format “<span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>:<span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>”, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> are games won by each player.
    These numbers are integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$99$</span> (inclusive).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each match, in the order they’re given in the input,
    output “<tt class="tt">da</tt>” if the result is valid, or
    “<tt class="tt">ne</tt>” if it isn’t.</p>
