<div class="problembody">
<p>There are black and white knights on a 5 by 5 chessboard.
    There are twelve of each color, and there is one square that is
    empty. At any time, a knight can move into an empty square as
    long as it moves like a knight in normal chess (what else did
    you expect?).</p>
<p>Given an initial position of the board, the question is:
    “what is the minimum number of moves in which we can reach the
    final position”, which is:</p>

</center>
</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>First line of the input file contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$N&lt;14$</span>) that indicates how many
    sets of inputs are there. The description of each set is given
    below:</p>
<p>Each set consists of five lines; each line represents one
    row of a chessboard. The positions occupied by white knights
    are marked by <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and the
    positions occupied by black knights are marked by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. The space corresponds to the
    empty square on board.</p>
<p>There is no blank line between the two sets of input.</p>
<p>The first set of the sample input below corresponds to this
    configuration:</p>

<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth ]{knightsfen-2}" src="/problems/knightsfen/file/statement/en/img-0002.jpg" style="width:20.00%"/>
</center>
</div>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each set your task is to find the minimum number of
    moves leading from the starting input configuration to the
    final one. If that number is bigger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, then output one line stating</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">Unsolvable in less than 11
    move(s).</tt></p>
<p>otherwise output one line stating</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">Solvable in <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> move(s).</tt></p>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \leq 10$</span>.</p>
<p>The output for each set is produced in a single line as
    shown in the sample output.</p>
