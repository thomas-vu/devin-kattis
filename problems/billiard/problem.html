<div class="problembody">
<p>In a billiard table with horizontal side <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> inches and vertical side
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> inches, a ball is
    launched from the middle of the table. After <span class="tex2jax_process">$s &gt; 0$</span> seconds the ball returns to
    the point from which it was launched, after having made
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> bounces off the
    vertical sides and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    bounces off the horizontal sides of the table. Find the
    launching angle <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>
    (measured from the horizontal), which will be between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span> degrees inclusive, and the
    initial velocity of the ball.</p>
<p>Assume that the collisions with a side are elastic (no
    energy loss), and thus the velocity component of the ball
    parallel to each side remains unchanged. Also, assume the ball
    has a radius of zero. Remember that, unlike pool tables,
    billiard tables have no pockets.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a sequence of lines, each containing five
    nonnegative integers separated by whitespace. The five numbers
    are: <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, respectively. All numbers are
    positive integers not greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>.</p>
<p>Input is terminated by a line containing five zeroes.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input line except the last, output a line
    containing two real numbers (rounded to exactly two decimal
    places) separated by a single space. The first number is the
    measure of the angle <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>
    in degrees and the second is the velocity of the ball measured
    in inches per second, according to the description above.</p>
