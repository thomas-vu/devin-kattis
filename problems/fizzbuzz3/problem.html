<p>Everybody loves easy problems. And no problem is easier than
    the Fizz Buzz problem. Indeed, F in Finals stands for Fizz
    Buzz!</p>
<p>Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_0$</span> denote the
    following string:</p>
<pre>
F_in_Finals_stands_for_Fizz_Buzz!
</pre>
<p>We can recursively generate <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_ i$</span> (for <span class="tex2jax_process">$i \geq 1$</span>) with the following
    rule:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$F_ i$</span> is the
        string obtained by replacing all characters <tt class="ttfamily">F</tt> in <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_{i-1}$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_0$</span> <b class="bfseries">simultaneously</b>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_1$</span> is
    the following string (without the line breaks):</p>
<pre>
F_in_Finals_stands_for_Fizz_Buzz!_in_
F_in_Finals_stands_for_Fizz_Buzz!inals_stands_for_
F_in_Finals_stands_for_Fizz_Buzz!izz_Buzz!  
</pre>
<p>And <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_2$</span> is the
    following string (without the line breaks):</p>
<pre>
F_in_Finals_stands_for_Fizz_Buzz!_in_
F_in_Finals_stands_for_Fizz_Buzz!inals_stands_for_
F_in_Finals_stands_for_Fizz_Buzz!izz_Buzz!_in_

<p>You can keep generating <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_
    i$</span> for all non-negative integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. To test whether you understand
    this operation, you should answer <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> questions <span class="tex2jax_process">$(X_ j, Y_ j)$</span>: what is the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_ j$</span>-th character of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_{Y_ j}$</span>?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>, the number of questions you need
    to answer (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq Q \leq 300\,
    000$</span>).</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines of
    input each contain two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_ j$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y_ j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq X_ j \leq 10^{18}$</span>;
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq Y_ j \leq
    10^{18}$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a string of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th character of the string should
    be the <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_ j$</span>-th character
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_{Y_ j}$</span>. If there
    are less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_ j$</span>
    characters in <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_{Y_ j}$</span>,
    output the character <tt class="ttfamily">?</tt> instead.</p>
