      SoCCat the Drill Sergeant is a very strict cat. Currently,
      SoCCat is training cat recruits!
    </blockquote>
<p>Drill Sergeant SoCCat is known for their ability to turn raw
    cat recruits into disciplined cat soldiers.</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cat
    recruits, numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Cat recruit
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> has height
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> cat units.</p>
<p>Being cats, some of them dislike each other. In particular,
    there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> pairs of cat
    recruits <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i, y_ i)$</span>
    who dislike each other.</p>
<p>One day, SoCCat gathered the recruits and gave them
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> simple instructions.
    The instructions are either of the following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Cat recruit <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
        should move into the line!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cat recruit <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
        should move out of the line!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After each instruction, whichever cat is in the line should
    line themselves up such that they are sorted in increasing
    order of height. The frontmost cat in the line should be the
    cat with the smallest height, and the backmost cat in the line
    should be the cat with the largest height.</p>
<p>For example, if cat recruits <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1, 3, 5]$</span> are currently in the line,
    and Drill Sergeant SoCCat gives the instruction "Cat recruit
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> should move into the
    line!", then the cat recruits in the line will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1, 2, 3, 5]$</span>. After, if Drill
    Sergeant SoCCat gives the instruction "Cat recruit <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> should move out of the line!",
    then the cat recruits in the line will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1, 2, 5]$</span>.</p>
<p>SoCCat is very strict, and will not tolerate any cat
    disobeying their orders. Inevitably, some of the cat recruits
    will be forced to stand adjacent to some of the cats they
    dislike.</p>
<p>The discontentment of cat recruit <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is equal to:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$3233$</span>, if cat
        recruit <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> dislikes
        both cats directly in front and behind them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$323$</span>, if cat
        recruit <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> dislikes
        the cat directly in front of them (and not the cat directly
        behind them).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span>, if cat
        recruit <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> dislikes
        the cat directly behind them (and not the cat directly in
        front of them).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, if cat recruit
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> does not dislike
        both cats directly in front and behind them. After all, all
        cat recruits (at the very least) dislike Drill Sergeant
        SoCCat!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After each instruction is carried out, Drill Sergeant SoCCat
    wants to find the sum of discontentment of all the cat
    recruits. As SoCCat is busy making sure none of the cat
    recruits disobey their orders, they have asked you to help them
    in counting the sum of discontentment. Help SoCCat!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, denoting the number of cat
    recruits and the number of pairs of cat recruits who dislike
    each other (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq
    10^9$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq
    100\, 000$</span>).</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each
    contain two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span>,
    denoting that cat recruit <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_
    i$</span> and cat recruit <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_
    i$</span> dislike each other (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq x_ i &lt; y_ i \leq n$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i, y_ i) \neq (x_ j, y_ j)$</span> if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i \neq j$</span>).</p>
<p>The next line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>, denoting the number of
    instructions that Drill Sergeant SoCCat gave (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq q \leq 300\, 000$</span>).</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines each
    contain two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$z_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i \in \{ 1, 2\} $</span>;
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq z_ i \leq n$</span>),
    denoting that Drill Sergeant SoCCat gave the following
    instruction:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i = 1$</span>, then
        cat recruit <span class="tex2jax_process">$z_ i$</span>
        should move into the line. It is guaranteed that cat
        recruit <span class="tex2jax_process">$z_ i$</span> is not
        currently in the line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i = 2$</span>, then
        cat recruit <span class="tex2jax_process">$z_ i$</span>
        should move out of the line. It is guaranteed that cat
        recruit <span class="tex2jax_process">$z_ i$</span> is
        currently in the line.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line should contain
    the sum of discontentment of all the cat recruits after the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th instruction is
    carried out.</p>
