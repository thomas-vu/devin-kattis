<div class="problembody">
<p>Paperwork is beginning to pile up on your desk, and tensions
    at the workplace are starting to mount. Your boss has
    threatened to fire you if you don’t make any progress by the
    end of the day. You currently have <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> units of paperwork on your desk,
    and your boss demands that you have <em>exactly</em>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> units of paperwork
    left by the end of the day.</p>
<p>The only hope for you now is to hire help. There are various
    agencies which offer paperwork reduction plans:</p>
<p>For <span class="tex2jax_process">$\$ A$</span> they will
    reduce your paperwork by one unit. For <span class="tex2jax_process">$\$ B$</span> they will reduce your entire
    paperwork by half (the amount of work left is rounded down to
    an integer when necessary).</p>
<p>Note that work can never be reduced to less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<p>Your task now is to produce a sorted table of agency names
    and their respective minimum costs to solve your workload
    problem.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of a single positive
    integer representing the number of cases to follow, at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$250$</span>. Each case begins
    with three positive integers separated by spaces: <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> – your starting workload,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> – your target
    workload, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> – the
    number of work reduction agencies available to you,
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le M \le N \le 100\,
    000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le L \le
    100$</span>). The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>
    lines have the format “[<em>agency name</em>]:<span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>,<span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>”, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> are the integer rates as described
    above for the given agency (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le A,B \le 10000$</span>). The length of the agency name will
    be between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span>, and will consist
    only of capital letters <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>-<tt class="ttfamily">Z</tt>. Agency names will be unique.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print “<tt class="ttfamily">Case
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span></tt>”, with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> being the case number,
    on a single line, followed by the table of agency names and
    their respective minimum costs, sorted in non-decreasing order
    of minimum costs. Sort job agencies with identical minimum
    costs in alphabetical order by agency name. For each line of
    the table, print out the agency name, followed by a space,
    followed by the minimum required cost for that agency to solve
    your problem.</p>
