</div>Jonas is developing the JUxtaPhone and is tasked with
    animating the compass needle. The API is simple: the compass
    needle is currently in some direction
    (between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$359$</span> degrees,
    with north being <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>,
    east being <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span>), and
    is being animated by giving the degrees to spin it. If the
    needle is pointing north, and you give the compass an input
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span>, it will spin
    clockwise (positive numbers mean clockwise direction) to stop
    at east, whereas an input of <span class="tex2jax_process">$-45$</span> would spin it counterclockwise
    to stop at north west.

    <p>The compass gives the current direction the phone is
    pointing and Jonas’ task is to animate the needle taking the
    <em>shortest path</em> from the current needle direction to the
    correct direction. Many <tt class="ttfamily">if</tt>s, moduli,
    and even an arctan later, he is still not convinced his
    <tt class="ttfamily">minimumDistance</tt> function is correct;
    he calls you on the phone.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_1$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n_1 \le 359$</span>), the current
    direction of the needle. The second line of input contains an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_2$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n_2 \le 359$</span>), the
    correct direction of the needle.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the change in direction that would make the needle
    spin the shortest distance from <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_2$</span>. A positive change indicates
    spinning the needle clockwise, and a negative change indicates
    spinning the needle counter-clockwise. If the two input numbers
    are diametrically opposed, the needle should travel clockwise.
    I.e., in this case, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$180$</span> rather than <span class="tex2jax_process">$-180$</span>.</p>
