<div class="problembody">
<p>In a Nature Reserve and Wildlife Park, there are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> environmental
    monitoring stations to monitor temperature, atmospheric
    pressure, humidity, fire, water quality, etc. Each station,
    labeled from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, uses solar panels to
    supply energy for its operations. There is a communication
    network consisting of several two-way communication channels
    between pairs of stations. All stations are connected via this
    communication network.</p>
<p>To process data at each station, the Nature Reserve and
    Wildlife Park needs to install a Smart Data Analysis program
    (with the size of <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>
    bytes) to all environmental monitoring stations. The program is
    initially installed directly to <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> stations, then broadcast to and
    installed in all other stations via the communication
    network.</p>
<p>To save energy, all communication channels are initially in
    an idle state and need to be activated to send information. It
    takes <span class="tex2jax_process">${E}_{ij}$</span> energy
    units to activate the communication channel between station
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and station
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>. Once a channel is
    activated, it takes one energy unit to transmit one byte via
    this channel.</p>
<p>Your task is to determine the minimum energy units required
    to send the Smart Data Analysis program to all stations from
    the initial <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>
    stations.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several datasets. The first line of
    the input contains the number of datasets, which is a positive
    number and is not greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>. The following lines describe the
    datasets.</p>
<p>Each dataset is described by the following lines:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains four positive integers: the
        number of environmental monitoring stations <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of two-way
        communication channels <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, the size of the program
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> (in bytes), and
        the number of initial stations <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>. The constraints are
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq S \leq N \leq
        {10}^{4}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M
        \leq {10}^{6}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M
        \leq N(N-1)/2$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
        \leq L \leq {10}^{6}$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> positive integer representing
        the initial <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>
        stations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines contains three positive
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$i, j$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">${E}_{ij}$</span> to denote
        that there is a two-way communicataion channel between
        station <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and
        station <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, and it
        takes <span class="tex2jax_process">${E}_{ij}$</span>
        energy units to activate this channel <span class="tex2jax_process">$({E}_{ij} \leq {10}^{6})$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set, output the minimum energy units required
    to send the Smart Data Analysis program to all stations from
    the initial <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>
    stations.</p>
