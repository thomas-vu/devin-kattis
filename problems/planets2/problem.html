<p>The spaceport likes collecting data on its visitors. We know
    that there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> nearby
    planets that generate all traffic in and out of the spaceport.
    Each planet contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    species and every ship contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> passengers of a particular
    species. No two planets contain the same species.</p>
<p>Can you help identify how many visitors from each planet
    come across the spaceport?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\le p\le 15$</span>, the number of planets
    whose ships are known to frequent the spaceport. Then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> lines follow: each
    line contains a unique planet name <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (from one to six uppercase ASCII
    letters), the number of alien species on the planet
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le n\le 12$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> words indicating the
    names of those species. Each species name <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> is a string of one to six
    uppercase ASCII letters.</p>
<p>The next line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le v\le 15$</span>, indicating the number
    of visiting spacecraft. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> lines contain an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le m\le 12$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number of
    visitors, and a word <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
    which is the name of their species, which live on one of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> planets.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print, in alphabetical order, each planetâ€™s name followed by
    the number of incoming visitors from that planet.</p>
