<div class="problembody">
<p>In the Linear City, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> gates arranged in a straight line.
    The gates are labelled from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. Between adjacent gates, there is
    a bidirectional road. Each road takes one hour to travel and
    has a toll fee. Since the roads are narrow, you can only travel
    from gates to gates but cannot U-turn between gates.</p>
<p>Crazy driver Gary starts at Gate <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and he wants to drive through Gate
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> while minimizing the
    cost of travelling. However, Gate <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> only allows a car to pass through
    after a certain time <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_
    i$</span>. As Gary is crazy, his car will always be traveling
    on any one of the roads, i.e., it will not stop at a gate. What
    is the minimum cost for him to drive through Gate <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>?</p>
<p>As an example, consider the sample input below. An optimal
    solution is the following:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Gate <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to Gate
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> (cost <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gate <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> to Gate
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> (cost <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gate <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to Gate
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> to Gate
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> (cost <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go between Gate <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>
        and Gate <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> until
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>-th hour (cost
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to and pass through Gate <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> (cost <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 10^5$</span>), the number of gates. The second line
    has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_1, \dots , C_{N-1}$</span>.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C_ i \leq 10^6$</span>) represents
    the toll fee of the road between Gate <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and Gate <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+1$</span>. The third line has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_1, \dots , T_ N$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq T_ i \leq 10^6$</span>) represents
    the opening time (in hour) for each gate. <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_1$</span> will always be 0.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output an integer representing the minimum cost of
    traveling.</p>
