<p>In the 21st century, Hunters are expected to master
    programming languages, in order to effectively gather
    information on the Internet.</p>
<p>Gon is currently learning NenScript — the most popular
    programming language amongst Hunters.</p>
<p>Today, Gon is learning variables. In NenScript, a variable
    always stores a string of zero or more characters, each
    character is any of the following: lowercase and uppercase
    English letters, digits, space and special characters:
    <b class="bfseries">!@#$%^&amp;*()-_=+</b>. In this problem, we
    call these characters <i class="itshape">good characters</i>.
    The name of every variable only consists of lowercase English
    letters, and underscore (_). The length of a variable name is
    <b class="bfseries">between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span></b>, inclusive.</p>
<p>In order to use a variable, first we need to declare it. The
    syntax of the declaration is as below:</p>
<pre>
var &lt;name&gt; = &lt;value&gt;;
</pre>
<p>Here &lt;name&gt; is the name of the variable you want to
    declare, and &lt;value&gt; is an <b class="bfseries">expression</b> which denotes the string assigned to
    this variable. There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> types of expression in
    NenScript:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">Variable name</b>, which means that
        the value equals to some previously declared variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">String literal</b>, which explicitly
        states the value by putting its sequence of characters in
        quotes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">Template literal</b>, which allows
        you to create a string based on values of other variables
        by embedding expressions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In a template literal, embedded expressions are calculated,
    then concatented with other parts to create a string. Template
    literals are enclosed by back-tick (<tt>`</tt>) and contain
    several (possibly zero) string expressions. String expressions
    are put inside curly braces following a dollar sign
    (${expression}). In other words, a template literal is an
    expression of the form <tt>`</tt><span class="tex2jax_process">$S_1\$ \{ E_1\} S_2\$ \{ E_2\} \ldots S_ n\$
    \{ E_ n\} S_{n+1}$</span><tt>`</tt>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \ge 0$</span>. For every valid
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ i$</span> is a string consisting of zero
    or more <i class="itshape">good characters</i>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$E_ i$</span> is an <b class="bfseries">expression</b>.</p>
<p>Let’s take an example:</p>
<pre>
var a = "Gon";
var b = a;
var c = `My name is ${a}`;
</pre>
<p>Here, the values of a, b and c are “Gon”, “Gon” and “My name
    is Gon”, respectively. Note that quotes are for clarity only,
    no vairable’s value contains any quotes.</p>
<p>Template literals can be nested, in other words, there can
    be a template literal inside a template literal. For
    example:</p>
<pre>
var a = "Gon";
var b = `My name ${`is ${a}`}`;
</pre>
<p>In this example, “ ‘is ${a}‘ ”, whose value is “is Gon”,
    acts as an embedded expression of the template literal assigned
    to variable b. The value of b is “My name is Gon”.</p>
<p>Your task is to read a sequence of commands in NenScript,
    each of them is either a variable declaration, as explained
    above; or a print request, which is in the following form,
    where &lt;expr&gt; is an expression:</p>
<pre>
print &lt;expr&gt;;
</pre>
<p>For each print request, print the value of the given
    expression.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several lines, each is either a
    variable declaration or a print request, as explained above. It
    is guaranteed all variables are neither declared twice, nor
    used before being declared. The input is terminated by a line
    with exactly one word “end.”. The total length of all lines
    does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^4$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each print request, print on a separate line the value
    of the corresponding expression. It is guaranteed that you have
    to print at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^4$</span> characters.
    Please be aware that we use the <b class="bfseries">case
    sensitive</b> and <b class="bfseries">space change
    sensitive</b> checker.</p>
