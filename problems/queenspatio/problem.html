<div class="problembody">
<p>The queen wishes to build a patio paved with of a circular
    center stone surrounded by circular rings of circular stones.
    All the stones in a ring will be the same size with the same
    number of stones in each ring. The stones in the innermost ring
    will be placed touching (tangent to) the adjacent stones in the
    ring and the central stone. The stones in the other rings will
    touch the two adjacent stones in the next inner ring and their
    neighbors in the same ring. The figures below depict a patio
    with one ring of three stones and a patio with 5 rings of 11
    stones. The patio is to be surrounded by a fence that goes
    around the outermost stones and straight between them (the
    heavier line in the figures).</p>

<p>The queen does not yet know how many stones there will be in
    each circle nor how many circles of stones there will be. To be
    prepared for whatever she decides, write a program to calculate
    the sizes of the stones in each circle and the length of the
    surrounding fence. The radius of the central stone is to be one
    <em>queenly</em> foot.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 200$</span>) which is the number
    of data sets that follow. Each data set should be processed
    identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, the number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \le N \le 20$</span>), of stones in each circle and the number,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le M \le 15$</span>), of circles of
    stones around the central stone.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is a single line of output. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single space which
    is then followed by the radius (in queenly feet) of the stones
    in the outermost ring (to <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> decimal places) which is followed
    by a single space which is then followed by the length (in
    <em>queenly feet</em>) of the fence (to <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> decimal places).</p>
