<p>“A watched pot never boils”, as the saying goes. Chef Edward
    has been cooking for ages, and empirically the saying seems to
    be true in his kitchen – he has yet to see a pot actually start
    boiling. His wife Gunilla is a bit suspicious of Edward’s claim
    though. She knows how he often loses focus after a little
    while, and thinks that it is very likely Edward gets tired of
    watching after about the same period of time starting when he
    puts it on the stove.</p>
<p>Being scientifically minded, Gunilla quickly designed an
    experiment which could help Edward gain more insight into the
    boiling of pots. Every time during the last week when Edward
    boiled a pot of water, he wrote down the intervals of time when
    he was not watching the pot. Now, he has a large log of these
    intervals, and wonders whether Gunilla is right (i.e. it may be
    the case Edward just happened to watch away every time the pot
    started boiling), or if his hypothesis is correct.</p>
<p>Given this data, is it possible that the pot actually starts
    boiling after the same amount of time, every time?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 1\, 000$</span>, the number of
    times Edward boiled water in the last week. Then, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> descriptions of a boiling follow.
    Each description contains two numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le a \le b \le 1\, 000$</span>. This
    means that Edward looked away during seconds <span class="tex2jax_process">$[a, b]$</span> (i.e. from the start of
    second <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, to the end of
    second <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>), and that
    Edward first saw the pot boiling once he looked back.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is impossible that all the pots actually started
    boiling at the same point in time, output <tt class="ttfamily">edward is right</tt>. Otherwise, output <tt class="ttfamily">gunilla has a point</tt>.</p>
