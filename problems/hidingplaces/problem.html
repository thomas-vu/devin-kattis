<p>In chess, the knight is one of the more interesting pieces.
    As illustrated below, it moves by jumping two spaces up or down
    and one to the left or right. Alternatively, it can jump two
    spaces to the left or right and one space up or down. This lets
    the knight cover a lot of chess board in just a few moves. No
    matter where the knight starts out, it can eventually reach any
    other space.</p>

<p>Given a chess board with just one knight on it, you want to
    find the hiding places, the spaces that it would take the
    knight the most jumps to reach from its initial location. For
    example, it would take the knight at least two jumps to reach
    space a8 in the board above. However, it would take at least
    three jumps for it to reach c1. Since there are other spaces
    that it would take the knight even more jumps to reach, neither
    a8 nor c1 are among the hiding places for this initial position
    of the knight.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 64$</span> indicating the number
    of test cases. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain an initial
    location for the knight. Knight locations will be given using
    the common chess notation of a lowercase letter (a-h) for the
    file (column) followed by a number (1-8) for the rank (row).
    The layout of the board and rank and file labels are
    illustrated in the figures above.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, report the number of jumps to the hiding
    places for the given initial location of the knight. Also
    report the list of hiding places using the same chess file and
    rank notation used in the input. If there are multiple hiding
    places, sort them from top to bottom and sort those in the same
    rank from left to right.</p>
