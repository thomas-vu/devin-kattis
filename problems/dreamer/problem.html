<div class="problembody">
<p>Bash just woke up from his sweetest dream ever. In his
    dream, he became the best Pokenom trainer — like no one ever
    was. It was on the date …</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Bash forgot the exact date. He only
    remembered that the date was written in format ‘DD MM YYYY’
    with exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> digits.
    He also remembers these <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> digits (but he does not remember
    their order). Of course, the date must be a valid date.</p>
<p>Since Bash was born on Jan 1st, 2000, he knows that the date
    was on or after Jan 1st, 2000. (Note that the date can be Jan
    1st, 2000 — it means Bash is destined to be the best Pokenom
    trainer since he was born!).</p>
<p>Bash really wants to know the date when he become the best
    Pokenom trainer. How many possible valid dates could there be?
    What is the earliest valid date that Bash could become the best
    Pokenom trainer?</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>On a leap year, February has <span class="tex2jax_process">$29$</span> days. Following are the rules for
    determining leap years:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>A year divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$400$</span> is a leap year,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A year divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> but not by <span class="tex2jax_process">$400$</span> is NOT a leap year,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A year divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> but not by <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> is a leap year,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A year not divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> is NOT a leap year.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq t \leq 50)$</span> — the number
        of test cases.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> lines describes one test case,
        contains eight digits in the format ‘XX XX XXXX’ (eight
        digits, separated by two blank spaces). Note that the input
        might not represent a valid date.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the first month of the year is represented by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$01$</span>, and the first day of
    the month by <span class="tex2jax_process">$01$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the
    number of possible dates and the earliest date which Bash could
    become the best Pokenom trainer, in the format ‘DD MM YYYY’. If
    there are no valid dates, print a single line containing
    ‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>’ (zero) instead.</p>
