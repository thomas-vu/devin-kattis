<div class="problembody">
<p>Inspired by a Piet Mondrian painting, you want to make a
    four-pane window out of four colored rectangles of glass. You
    are given the sizes of the four panes of glass. Can you arrange
    them into a square? You may rotate the panes. The panes should
    cover the entire square without overlap.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of exactly four lines. Each of the four
    lines contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le w,h \le 1\, 000$</span>), representing the width and height
    of one of the four rectangular panes of glass.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> if the four panes can be arranged
    to form a square, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    otherwise.</p>
