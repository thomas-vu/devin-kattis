<p>As you know, a kayaking competition is going on as we speak.
    Unfortunately strong winds have damaged a few kayaks, and the
    race starts in 5 minutes!. Fortunately, some teams have brought
    reserve kayaks. Since kayaks are bulky and hard to carry, teams
    are willing to lend kayaks to opposing teams if and only if
    they are starting immediately next to them. For example, team
    with the starting number 4 will lend its reserve kayak only to
    teams 3 and 5. Of course if some team did bring a reserve and
    its kayak was damaged, they will use it themselves and not lend
    it to anyone.</p>
<p>You as the organizer now need to know, what is the minimal
    number of teams that cannot start the race, not even in
    borrowed kayaks.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2
    \le N \le 10)$</span>, total number of teams, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2
    \le S \le N)$</span>, number of teams with damaged kayaks and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le R \le N)$</span>, number of teams
    with reserve kayaks.</p>
<p>The second line contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> numbers, the starting numbers of
    teams with damaged kayaks. The second line will not contain
    duplicates.</p>
<p>The third line contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> numbers, the starting numbers of
    teams with reserve kayaks. The third line will not contain
    duplicates.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output should contain the
    smallest number of teams that cannot start the competition.</p>
