<p>Gustav is studying to become an interpreter. In this line of
    work, knowing several languages is a must, and Gustav is
    already fluent in French, Mandarin, Nahuatl and even Finnish.
    But there is one language that Gustav struggles with:
    Norwegian. Before Gustav can graduate, he must complete the
    infamous Norwegian Conclusive Proficiency Check.</p>
<p>This exam consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> yes/no questions. Answering
    correctly gives <span class="tex2jax_process">$+1$</span>
    point, answering incorrectly gives <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> point, and not answering gives
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> points. To pass the
    exam, at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> points
    are needed. For each question, Gustav has a guess that he knows
    is correct with probability <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_
    i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0.5 \leq p_ i \leq
    1$</span>). Note that <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i \geq
    0.5$</span>, because otherwise guessing the opposite would be
    better.</p>
<p>What is the maximum possible probability of passing the
    exam, assuming we carefully choose which questions to answer
    and which ones to leave unanswered? Note that unlike a
    programming contest, the exam does not have instant feedback.
    So Gustav will answer the questions, hand in his answers, and
    only later be told the results.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq k \leq n \leq 5000$</span>). The second line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> real numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0.5 \leq p_ i \leq 1.0$</span>). These
    numbers will have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> digits after the decimal
    point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the probability that we pass the exam. Your answer
    will be considered correct if it has an absolute or relative
    error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
