<p>Jaap is playing darts at the local pub with a group of
    friends. His darts throwing skills are not that great, so he
    just tries to aim at the center of the dartboard. His
    mathematical skills are better though, and he wonders what is
    his expected score for one dart.</p>
<p>After a while Jaap estimates that his darts hit the
    dartboard (or often miss it) with a probability distribution
    that depends only on the radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> from the center of the board, and
    has the Gaussian form<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000490"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a></p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    f(r) = \frac{1}{2\pi \sigma ^2} e^{-\frac{r^2}{2\sigma ^2}}.
    \]</span>
<p>That is, the probability of hitting a small surface area
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\Delta x\! \cdot \! \Delta
    y$</span> at a distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> from the center is given by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(r) \Delta x\! \cdot \! \Delta
    y$</span>. Here <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sigma $</span>
    denotes the standard deviation, and Jaap found out that this
    depends strongly on how many beers he has had.</p>
<p>For those not familiar with the game of darts, a dartboard
    is depicted below. The score for hitting each of the regions of
    the dartboard is as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>the inner <em>bull’s eye</em> is worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> points;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the <em>bull</em> annulus is <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> points;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>each pie has worth of the respective number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>, but</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the inner <em>triple ring</em> has triple the worth of
        the pie, while</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the outer <em>double ring</em> has double the worth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if the dart lands outside the double ring, the
    score is zero. Note that the pies of all numbers have equal
    area.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains 6 floating point numbers of strictly
    increasing size: the radii of the <em>bull’s eye</em>,
    <em>bull</em>, inner and outer <em>triple ring</em>, and inner
    and outer <em>double ring</em>, all in centimeters. The second
    line contains the standard deviation <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sigma $</span> in centimeters as a floating
    point number. All floating point numbers are in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[10^{-3}, 100]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the expected score of one dart for Jaap as a floating
    point number on a single line. The answer should be correct up
    to either a relative or absolute error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span>.</p>
