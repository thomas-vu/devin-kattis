<p>Pia is a famous bartender at the hip Stockholm night club
    Supernova. One of her most impressive feats is the mixing a
    series of drinks using each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> distinct drink ingredients in the
    bar exactly once. She does this in the following way.</p>
<p>First, Pia chooses a number of drinks to make. Each of the
    drink ingredients are then lined up in front of her in order
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \dots , N$</span>. For the
    first drink, she uses some positive number <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> of ingredients starting from the
    left, i.e. <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, ..., K$</span>.
    For the next drink, she uses some positive number <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> of ingredients starting from the
    first unused ingredient, i.e. <span class="tex2jax_process">$K
    + 1, K + 2, \dots , K + L$</span>. She continues this process
    until the final drink, which uses some set of ingredients
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N - M, N - M + 1, \dots ,
    N$</span>.</p>
<p>However, not every pair of ingredients work well in a drink.
    For example, milk and water would not go very well together.
    She may not include a bad pair of ingredients in any drink.</p>
<p>So far, she has managed to make a different set of drinks
    every night. For how many nights can she mix a new set of
    drinks? We call two sets of drinks different if they do not
    consist of the exact same drinks (though they are allowed to
    have drinks in common).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 100\, 000$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le P \le 100\,
    000$</span>, the number of ingredients and bad pairs of
    ingredients.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>
    lines contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le a \not= b \le N$</span>, two ingredients that do not work
    well together in a drink. The same pair of ingredients may
    appear multiple times in this list.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the number of nights Pia can
    construct a different set of drinks. Since this number may be
    large, output the remainder when divided by <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9 + 7$</span>.</p>
