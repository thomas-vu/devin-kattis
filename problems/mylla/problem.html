        Fullkomin mylla
      </div>
</div>
<p>Arnar and Hannes are very competitive friends and love
    competing with one another. They are always looking for new
    games to compete at and they both prefer games involving a lot
    of thinking.</p>
<p>Hannes found a new version of tic-tac-toe called
    <em>Fullkomin mylla</em> and found it likely he’d beat Arnar at
    this game. He thus went to Arnar and asked him whether he was
    up for it. Arnar said he’d be up for it but only if the loser
    paid for the food next time they went to American Style.</p>
<p>To be sure that the better player won, and that luck
    wouldn’t be involved, they decided to play a few rounds, and
    the first player to win <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> rounds would win the bet. Each
    round will consist of <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>
    games of Fullkomin Mylla and whoever wins more games out of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, wins that round.</p>
<p>Furthermore they aren’t going to spend time on unneccesary
    games. Thus they will stop a round as soon as its victor is
    clear. For example if Arnar wins the first three games of a
    round they won’t play more games in this round, since Arnar
    will win the round no matter what the results of the last two
    games are.</p>
<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>Fullkomin mylla is played by creating one large tic-tac-toe
    board and then in each cell of the large board there is a
    smaller tic-tac-toe board. Players take alternating turns and
    choose cells in the small boards to play in until a victor
    emerges. If a player wins one of the small boards, the
    corresponding cell in the large board is filled in with that
    players mark. If a player wins the large board, they win the
    game.</p>
<p>Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> starts and
    can choose any cell in the large board to play in and then
    chooses a cell in the smaller board contained in that cell.
    After that player <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> has
    to play in the smaller board that corresponds to the cell in
    the small board that player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> chose. If that board is already
    won then player <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> can
    choose any cell. This repeats until one player wins the game or
    there are no moves left to make and the game’s a tie.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> which is the number of rounds
    needed to win the bet. The next line contains a string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> describing who won
    each game, A if Arnar won and H if Hannes won. You may assime
    that no ties came up and that the string describes exactly the
    games that were played, in the order they were played.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print who lost the bet.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample Input</h2>
<p>In the first sample the winner is the first player to win
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> rounds. The games
    proceeded as follows:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>The first round begins. Arnar wins the first game of
        this round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hannes wins the second game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arnar wins the third game. The score is now 2-1 for
        Arnar, but Hannes could still win the round, so they
        continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hannes wins the fourth game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arnar wins the fifth game, so Arnar wins the first round
        3-2.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second round begins. Arnar wins the first game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arnar also wins the second game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hannes now comes in hot and wins the third game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hannes wins the fourth game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hannes is on a roll and wins the fifth game, so he wins
        the second round 3-2. Now both have won 1 round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third round begins. Hannes wins the first game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arnar wins the second game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hannes wins the third game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arnar wins the fourth game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arnar wins the fifth game and thus wins the round 3-2.
        Now Arnar has won two rounds and is thus victorious!</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In the second sample the winner is the first player to win
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> rounds. The games
    proceeded as follows:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>The first round begins. Hannes wins the first game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hannes wins the second game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hannes is on a wild roll and also wins the third games.
        Now Hannes has three wins, but there are only games left in
        the round. Thus Arnar has no chance of winning this round,
        so the round ends 3-0 for Hannes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second round starts. Arnar wins the first ggame and
        thus wins back some respect after being steamrolled by
        Hannes in the first round.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hannes doesn’t let this affect him and wins the second
        game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hannes then just keeps going and wins the third
        game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>He shoots and he scores! Hannes wins the fourth game. He
        has three wins this round and Arnar only one. There is only
        one game left and no matter how it goes Hannes will win it.
        Thus they stop this round and Hannes wins 3-1. Hannes has
        now won two rounds and thus wins the bet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>The solution will be tested on input data of varying
    difficulty and the data is divided into groups as shown in the
    table below. The solution will then be scored according to how
    many groups are solved.</p>
