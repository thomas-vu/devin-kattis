<p>The Burrows-Wheeler transform is a technique for
    transforming a text message so that it responds well to
    compression techniques. Under this transform, we consider all
    cyclic shifts of an input string. For example, if our text was
    the string “arbitrary string”, then the string “rbitrary
    stringa” would be the result of cyclicly shifting the string
    one character to the left. The first character is moved to the
    end of the string, and all of the other characters are moved
    one index earlier. If a string has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> characters, then there are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cyclic shifts of the
    string. The text on the left lists all cyclic shifts of the
    string “arbitrary string”, one per line.</p>

<p>Under the Burrows-Wheeler transform, we imagine that we
    lexicographically sorted all these lines. The figure on the
    right illustrates what this would yield for the text “arbitrary
    string”. The original message is encoded as the right-hand
    column of this sorted list of cyclicly shifted copies of the
    input string. For example, “arbitrary string” would be encoded
    as “ygrrnrbitata isr”.</p>
<p>For this problem, you are expected to compute the
    Burrows-Wheeler transform for an arbitrary line of text. Of
    course, the transform is invertible, but we’ll let some other
    programmer worry about recovering the original message from
    your encoding.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> messages, one per line. A
    message may use lowercase or uppercase letters (a–z), digits,
    punctuation, and spaces. Each message may be up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> characters in length.
    Messages continue up to the end of file. The total number of
    input characters is no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{20}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input message, output a single line that results
    from applying the Burrows-Wheeler transform. The validation for
    this problem is sensitive to both case and spacing changes.</p>
