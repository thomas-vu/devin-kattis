<p>A worm is at the bottom of a pole. It wants to reach the
    top, but it is too lazy to climb to the top without stopping.
    It can crawl up the pole a certain number of inches at a time,
    falling down a lesser number of inches right after while it
    rests. How many times does the worm need to crawl up in order
    to reach the top of the pole?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line that contains three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a, b$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq b &lt; a \leq
    100$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>,
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; h \leq 100\,
    000$</span>) indicating the amount <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> of inches the worm can climb at a
    time, the amount <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> of
    inches the worm falls during its resting period, and the height
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> of the pole,
    respectively. For the purposes of this problem, the worm is
    modeled as a point and thus has no length.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of times the worm must crawl up in order
    to reach the top of the pole.</p>
