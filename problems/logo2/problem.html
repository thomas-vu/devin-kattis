<p>Logo is a programming language built around a turtle.
    Commands in the language cause the turtle to move. The turtle
    has a pen attached to it. As the turtle moves, it draw lines on
    the page. The turtle can be programmed to draw interesting
    pictures.</p>
<p>We are interested in making the turtle draw a picture, then
    return to the point that it started from. For example, we could
    give the turtle the following program:</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">fd 100 lt 120 fd 100 lt 120 fd
    100</tt></p>
<p>The command <tt class="ttfamily">fd</tt> causes the turtle
    to move forward by the specified number of units. The command
    <tt class="ttfamily">lt</tt> causes the turtle to turn left by
    the specified number of degrees. Thus the above commands cause
    the turtle to draw an equilateral triangle with sides 100 units
    long. Notice that after executing the commands, the turtle ends
    up in the same place as it started. The turtle understands two
    additional commands. The command <tt class="ttfamily">bk</tt>
    causes the turtle to move backward by the specified number of
    units. The command <tt class="ttfamily">rt</tt> causes the
    turtle to turn right by the specified number of degrees. The
    distances and angles in all commands are always non-negative
    integers.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we have been messy in writing the program
    down, and cannot read our own writing. One of the numbers in
    the program is missing. Assuming the turtle ends up at the
    place that it started at the end of its journey, can you find
    the missing number?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer specifying the
    number of test cases to follow, at most 20. Each test case
    starts with a line containing one integer, the number of
    commands to follow. The commands follow, one on each line. Each
    test case will contain no more than 1000 commands. The argument
    of each command is either an integer or a question mark (?).
    There will be exactly one question mark in each test case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output line containing a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> such that when the
    question mark in the program is replaced by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the turtle ends up at the same
    point that it started from once the program completes. If the
    question mark is the argument of an <tt class="ttfamily">lt</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">rt</tt> command, the
    angle in the output must be between 0 and 359 degrees,
    inclusive. The correct answer will always be an integer, and we
    guarantee that for every test case, there will be only one
    correct answer.</p>
