<p>The trick to boiling vegetables is to make sure all pieces
    are about the same size. If they are not, the small ones get
    too soft or the large ones get undercooked (or both).
    Fortunately, you have heard of the kitchen knife, but your
    parents’ warnings of using sharp instruments still echoes in
    your head. Therefore you better use it as little as possible.
    You can take a piece of a vegetable of weight <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and cut it arbitrarily in two
    pieces of weight <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_\text
    {left}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_\text
    {right}$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_\text
    {left}+w_\text {right}=w$</span>. This operation constitutes a
    “cut”. Given a set of pieces of vegetables, determine the
    minimum number of cuts needed to make the ratio between the
    smallest and the largest resulting piece go above a given
    threshold.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a floating point number <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> with 2 decimal digits,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.5&lt;T&lt;1$</span>, and a
    positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N\le 1\,
    000$</span>. Next follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> positive integer weights
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_1,w_2,...,w_ N$</span>. All
    weights are less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum number of cuts needed to make the ratio
    between the resulting minimum weight piece and the resulting
    maximum weight piece be above <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>. You may assume that the number of
    cuts needed is less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span>.</p>
<p>To avoid issues with floating point numbers, you can assume
    that the optimal answer for ratio <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> is the same as for ratio
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T + 0.0001$</span>.</p>
