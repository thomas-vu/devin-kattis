<p><em>Mancala</em> is a family of board games played around
    the world, sometimes called <em>sowing</em> games, or
    <em>count-and-capture</em> games, which describes the game
    play. One simple variant is a solitaire game called
    <em>Tchoukaillon</em> which was described by Véronique
    Gautheron. <em>Tchoukaillon</em> is played on a board with an
    arbitrary number of bins numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \ldots $</span>, containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b[1], b[2], \ldots $</span>
    counters respectively and an extra empty bin called the Roumba
    on the left.</p>

<p>A single play consists on choosing a bin, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, for which <span class="tex2jax_process">$b[n] = n$</span> (indicated by the darker
    circles in the diagram) and distributing the counters one per
    bin to the bins to the left including the <em>Roumba</em>
    (getting the next diagram below in the figure above). If there
    is no bin where <span class="tex2jax_process">$b[n] =
    n$</span>, then the board is a losing board.</p>
<p>If there is a sequence of plays which takes the initial
    board distribution to one in which every counter is in the
    <em>Roumba</em>, the initial distribution is called a winnable
    board. In the example above, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0,1,3,\ldots $</span> is a winnable board
    (the “<span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span>” indicates
    all the bins to the right of bin <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>). For each total number of
    counters, there is a unique distribution of the counters to
    bins to make a winnable board for that total count (so
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0,1,3,\ldots $</span> is the
    only winnable board with <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> counters).</p>
<p>Write a program which finds the winnable board for a total
    count input.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 200$</span>), which is the
    number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be
    processed identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single space,
    followed by the total count <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 2000$</span>) of the winnable board to be found.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there will be multiple lines of output.
    The first line of output contains the data set number,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single
    space, followed by the index of the last bin, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, with a non-zero count. Input will
    be chosen so that <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> will
    be no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$80$</span>. The
    first line of output for each dataset is followed by the bin
    counts <span class="tex2jax_process">$b[1], b[2], \ldots ,
    b[B]$</span>, 10 per line separated by single spaces.</p>
