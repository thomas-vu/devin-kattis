<p>Playing games is the best way to improve flexibility,
    critical thinking and strategy.</p>
<p>To become the best Pokenom player, Bash is playing some
    games with his Pokenom Chikapu.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Bash writes down a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> containing only lowercase
        English letters. No <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> consecutive characters in
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> are equal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bash and Chikapu alternatively take turns to play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In each turn, a player must delete one character in
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>. There are
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> conditions:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first and last characters can not be
            deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the character is deleted, in the new string,
            no <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> consecutive
            characters are equal.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The player who cannot delete a character loses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Chikapu plays first.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After playing <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9 +
    7$</span> games, Chikapu won <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> games and lost all <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9 + 7$</span> times. Chikapu thinks that
    Bash is cheating, by selecting a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> such that Bash always wins.</p>
<p>Given some string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>,
    can you help determine who would win the game, if they both
    play optimally?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> â€” the number of test cases
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le T \le 20)$</span>.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines each
    contain exactly one string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3
    \le |S| \le 10^5)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print on one line the name of the
    winner, if they both play optimally. Please note that this
    problem uses case-sensitive checker.</p>
