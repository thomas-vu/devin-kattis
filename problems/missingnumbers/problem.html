<p>You enjoy your new job as a teacher of young children. It’s
    fun to see them learning to count, recognize letters, draw, and
    interact with the world.</p>
<p>One common problem you’ve noticed is that children often
    forget numbers when counting. For example, early on they might
    count “one, two, three, five, six.” You have to remind them
    about that “four” that they didn’t say. And as they get more
    proficient and clever, they may use the “quick” way of
    counting: “one, two, skip a few, ninety-nine, one hundred!”</p>
<p>Please write a program that can help you (and your students)
    identify the missing numbers when they are counting.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100$</span>. Each of the next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contains one
    number that the child recited. Each recited number is an
    integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> (inclusive). They
    are listed in increasing order, and there are no
    duplicates.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the child recited all the numbers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and the last number they recited,
    then print <tt class="ttfamily">good job</tt>.</p>
<p>If the child missed any numbers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and the last number they recited,
    then print those missing numbers in increasing numeric order,
    one per line.</p>
