<p>A fundamental operation in computational geometry is
    determining whether two objects touch. For example, in a game
    that involves shooting, we want to determine if a player’s shot
    hits a target. A shot is a two dimensional point, and a target
    is a two dimensional enclosed area. A shot hits a target if it
    is inside the target. The boundary of a target is inside the
    target. Since it is possible for targets to overlap, we want to
    identify how many targets a shot hits.</p>

<p>The figure above illustrates the targets (large unfilled
    rectangles and circles) and shots (filled circles) of the
    sample input. The origin <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,
    0)$</span> is indicated by a small unfilled circle near the
    center.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 30$</span> indicating the
    number of targets. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines begins with the word
    <tt class="tt">rectangle</tt> or <tt class="tt">circle</tt> and
    then a description of the target boundary. A rectangular
    target’s boundary is given as four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1~ y_1~ x_2~ y_2$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1&lt;x_2$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1&lt;y_2$</span>. The points
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1,y_1)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2,y_2)$</span> are the
    bottom-left and top-right corners of the rectangle,
    respectively. A circular target’s boundary is given as three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x~ y~ r$</span>. The
    center of the circle is at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$0&lt;r\leq 1\, 000$</span> is the radius of
    the circle.</p>
<p>After the target descriptions is an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100$</span> indicating the
    number of shots that follow. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x~ y$</span>, indicating the
    coordinates of a shot. All <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates for targets and shots
    are in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-1\, 000,1\,
    000]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    shots, print the total number of targets the shot hits.</p>
