</div>Two players, Stan and Ollie, play, starting with two
    natural numbers. Stan, the first player, subtracts any positive
    multiple of the lesser of the two numbers from the greater of
    the two numbers, provided that the resulting number must be
    nonnegative. Then Ollie, the second player, does the same with
    the two resulting numbers, then Stan, etc., alternately, until
    one player is able to subtract a multiple of the lesser number
    from the greater to reach 0, and thereby wins. For example, the
    players may start with <span class="tex2jax_process">$(25,7)$</span> and the game might progress
    as
    <pre>
         25 7
         11 7
          4 7
          4 3
          1 3
          1 0
</pre>
<p>and Stan wins.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a number of lines. Each line contains
    two positive integers less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{31}$</span> giving the starting two
    numbers of the game. Stan always starts. The last line of input
    contains two zeroes and should not be processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line of input, output one line saying either Stan
    wins or Ollie wins assuming that both of them play
    perfectly.</p>
