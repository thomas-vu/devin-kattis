<p>One of the world’s first civilisations was that of the
    ancient Uxuhul indians, in the jungles of Central America. The
    Uxuhul culture flourished for almost a thousand years, with its
    golden era around 3200 BC. Each year high priests, representing
    different parts of the realm, gathered in the capital to vote
    on important matters. There were always exactly three issues to
    vote on, and each issue was a simple yes/no question. The three
    issues were all decided in one single voting round, in the
    following manner:</p>
<p>All the priests would gather in a large room, with a table
    in the centre. On the table lie three flat stones, each with
    one white, and one black side. Each stone represented an issue,
    with the black side up symbolising the outcome “no” and the
    white side the outcome “yes”. Initially all stones had the
    black side up, representing negative outcome on all issues. In
    order of age, from youngest to oldest, each priest voted, by
    turning exactly one stone, thus (temporarily) changing the
    outcome of one issue. It was not allowed to skip the vote, each
    priest had to flip a stone. The colours of the side facing up
    on the stones after the oldest priest had flipped the stone of
    his choice, determined the final outcome of the voting on the
    three issues.</p>
<p>The Uxuhul political life was rather complex, with a lot of
    lobbying by different interest groups. Lobbying (and bribery),
    gave each priest preferences between the eight different
    outcomes of the three issues. Religious rules forced each
    priest to publicly state his preference order between the eight
    outcomes, before the voting process started. Based on knowledge
    of each other priest’s preferences, it was possible for the
    priests to choose a stone to flip in the way that it gained
    their interest best. As the Uxuhul were advanced logicians,
    with deep knowledge of game theory, each priest was actually
    able to vote in the optimal way!</p>
<p>Eventually, the complexity and rigidity of their political
    system brought the Uxuhul culture to collapse. Today only ruins
    remain of their cities and temples. Historians and
    archaeologists try to understand more about their history by
    studying the results from their yearly votes. However, only
    records of the priests’ preferences remain, not the actual
    outcomes of the votes. Now it is your task to find a way to
    recover the outcomes.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1&lt;n&lt;100$</span>, the number of voting
    rounds. Starting on the next line, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> problems follow, one by one. Each
    voting starts with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le m \le 100$</span>, stating the number of voting priests.
    Then there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines,
    defining the preference order for the outcomes of the three
    issues for each voter, in order, starting with the voter who
    will begin the voting procedure. The preferences for each
    outcome (NNN, NNY, NYN, NYY, YNN, YNY, YYN, and YYY
    respectively, where ‘N’ stands for no and ‘Y’ for yes), are
    given as an integer in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1 \ldots 8]$</span>. Lower numbers indicate
    higher preference. The preferences for the eight outcomes are
    given in the same order as the enumeration of the outcomes
    above.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    voting problems, output one line describing the outcome of the
    votes for the three issues, ‘Y’ for yes, and ‘N’ for no.</p>
