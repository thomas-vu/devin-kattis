<p>Having solved the match issue, Mirko faced another
    challenging problem. His mom ordered him to read an article
    about the newest couples on the Croatian show-biz scene in the
    “Moja Tajna” magazine. The article is written in a very small
    font size which Mirko cannot read. Luckily, Mirko has a scanner
    in the closet which will enlarge the article for him.</p>
<p>The article is a matrix of characters with <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rows and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> columns. The characters are
    letters of the English alphabet, digits and the character
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’ (period). Mirko’s scanner
    supports two parameters, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z_
    R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z_ C$</span>. It
    <b class="bfseries">substitutes each character</b> it scans
    with a <b class="bfseries">matrix of <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z_ R$</span> rows and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z_ C$</span> columns</b>, where all entries
    are equal to the scanned character.</p>
<p>Mirko realized his scanner’s software no longer works so he
    needs your help.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first row contains four integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z_
    R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z_ C$</span>.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>, while <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z_ R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z_ C$</span> are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rows contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> characters each, representing the
    article from “Moja Tajna”.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should be a matrix of characters with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R \cdot Z_ R$</span> rows and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C \cdot Z_ C$</span> columns,
    the enlarged article.</p>
