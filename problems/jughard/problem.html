<div class="problembody">
<p>You have two empty jugs and tap that may be used to fill a
    jug. When filling a jug from the tap, you can only fill it
    completely (i.e., you cannot partially fill it to a desired
    level, since there are no volume measurements on the jug).</p>
<p>You may empty either jug at any point.</p>
<p>You may transfer water between the jugs: if transferring
    water from a larger jug to a smaller jug, the smaller jug will
    be full and there will be water left behind in the larger
    jug.</p>
<p>Given the volumes of the two jugs, is it possible to have
    one jug with some specific volume of water?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the number of test cases
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 100\,
    000$</span>). Each test case is composed of three integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq a, b \leq 10\, 000\, 000$</span>) are the volumes of the
    two jugs, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is the
    desired volume of water to be generated. You can assume that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d \leq \max (a,b)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    test cases, output either <tt class="ttfamily">Yes</tt> or
    <tt class="ttfamily">No</tt>, depending on whether the specific
    volume of water can be placed in one of the two jugs.</p>
