<p>“Waif Until Dark” is a daycare center specializing in
    children of households where both parents work during the day.
    In order to keep the little monsters …that is, darlings
    …occupied, the center has a set of toys that the kiddies can
    play with. Some of these toys belong to one of several
    categories – sports toys, musical toys, dolls, etc. In order to
    save wear and tear on these types of toys, the teachers allow
    only certain numbers of toys of each category to be used during
    playtime. Of course, kids being kids, not all of the toys are
    liked by everyone, so sometimes it’s difficult to make sure
    every kid has a toy they like. Given all of these constraints,
    the CEO of Waif has come to you to write a little program to
    determine the maximum number of these monsters (let’s be honest
    here) who can be satisfied.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line containing three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> indicating the number of children,
    the number of toys and the number of toy categories
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n,m \leq 100, 0 \leq p
    \leq m$</span>). Both children and toys are numbered starting
    at <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. After this line
    are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines of the form
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$i_1$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$i_2$</span> …<span class="tex2jax_process">$i_ k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k, i_1, i_2, \ldots , i_ k \leq
    m$</span>); the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{th}$</span>
    of these lines indicates that child <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> is willing to play with toys
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i_1$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$i_ k$</span>. Next are <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> lines of the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_2$</span> …<span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ l$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq r \leq l \leq m, 1 \leq t_1, t_2, \ldots , t_ l \leq
    m$</span>); the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{th}$</span>
    of these lines indicates that toys <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ l$</span> are in category <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> and that at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> of these toys can be used. Toys
    can be in at most one category and any toy not listed in these
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> lines is not in any
    toy category and all of them can be used. No toy number appears
    more than once on any line.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the maximum number of children that can be satisfied
    with a toy that they like, provided that each toy can be used
    by at most one child.</p>
