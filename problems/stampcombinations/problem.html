<p>You’re on your way to pick up a package from the store, wrap
    it, and mail it. You want to bring a certain number of stamps
    to mail it, and you have a long roll of stamps that you can
    use. Now, over time, you’ve occasionally pulled off a stamp
    from somewhere in the middle of the roll, and now you’re left
    with a strip where stamps are clustered in groups, separated by
    empty spaces.</p>
<p>Being practical, you don’t want to tear individual stamps,
    and so you’ll only tear the roll in between the clusters of
    stamps. And, you don’t want to be left with multiple rolls of
    stamps, so you can only pull these groups off of the beginning
    or end of the roll. Is it possible to do this with the roll of
    stamps you have?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of two integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le m, n \le 10^6$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le
    m \cdot n \le 10^7$</span>, giving the number of clusters of
    stamps and the number of queries you will have.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i, 1 \le a_ i \le 100$</span>, separated
    by spaces. These give the number of stamps in each cluster, in
    order from the beginning to the end of the roll.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    contain one integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le q \le 10^8$</span>, giving
    a query, where a query is the number of stamps needed to mail a
    package.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query, output one line containing “<tt class="ttfamily">Yes</tt>” if it is possible to bring that number of
    stamps, or ‘<tt class="ttfamily">No</tt>” if it is not possible
    to bring that number of stamps.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample</h2>
<p>The roll contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>
    clusters of stamps.</p>
<p>A group of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> stamps
    can be taken by tearing just the first cluster of stamps off of
    the roll.</p>
<p>A group of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> stamps
    can be taken by tearing the first two clusters of stamps off of
    the roll.</p>
<p>A group of <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> stamps
    can be taken by tearing the first cluster (of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>) and the last cluster (of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>) off of the roll.</p>
<p>A group of <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span> stamps
    can be taken by taking the entire roll.</p>
<p>It is not possible to take just <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> stamp, since tearing the roll to
    take the single stamp in the middle of the roll would not leave
    you with a single roll of stamps, and it is not possible to
    tear in the middle of a cluster.</p>
