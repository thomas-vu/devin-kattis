<div class="problembody">
<p>The legendary starship of Flatland, Rectalateral, needs to
    escape from a star which is about to go supernova by
    teleporting away. Unfortunately, the possible teleport
    destinations are in the middle of an asteroid field. Luckily,
    you have a map of the asteroid field with the exact radius and
    location of the asteroids (asteroids in Flatland are circles,
    obviously). As the navigator on board, you must investigate
    each of the possible teleport destinations and determine if
    they are safe.</p>
<p>A teleportation destination is safe if and only if no
    asteroid would touch or overlap Rectalateral immediately after
    the teleportation completes. Rectalateral will be axis-aligned
    after the teleportation (the sides of Rectalateral are parallel
    to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis or the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-axis).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input is two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$ 1\leq w, h \leq 100$</span>, the width and
    height of the rectangular Rectalateral.</p>
<p>The second line of input is two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n, m$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100$</span> is the number of
    asteroids in the asteroid field, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 100$</span> is the number of
    potential teleportation destinations.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines are
    each three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ a , y_ a
    , r_ a$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1000 \leq
    x_ a , y_ a \leq 1000$</span> is the location of the center of
    the circular asteroid and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq
    r_ a \leq 100$</span> is the radius of the asteroid.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines are
    each two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ r,y_
    r$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1000 \leq x_
    r,y_ r \leq 1000$</span> is the location of the bottom-left
    corner of Rectalateral after the teleport. (This means that the
    top-right corner will be at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_
    r + w, y_ r + h)$</span>.)</p>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis increases
    rightwards, and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-axis increases upwards.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each potential teleportation destination, in the order
    the teleportation destinations were given, output a single line
    “<tt>DOOMSLUG GO!</tt>” if the teleport destination is safe,
    otherwise output a single line “<tt>DOOMSLUG STOP!</tt>”.</p>
