<div class="problembody">
<p>You and a friend have been playing a card game for a while.
    In the game, a player has a list of cards, each containing an
    integer. The goal is to guess exactly what cards the opponent
    has. To accomplish this, they take turns asking the opponent
    how many of the integers on their cards are in a given
    range.</p>
<p>Normally, answering this question is simple – just count the
    cards. To make the game a bit harder, your friend proposed
    instead playing a massive variant of the game, where each
    player can have up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\,
    000$</span> cards! Answering the opponent’s questions by
    counting cards one at a time is now quite slow... Perhaps you
    could write a computer program to answer these questions a bit
    faster?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 100\, 000$</span>), the number of cards one of the
    players has. The next line contains the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers written on the player’s
    cards, each between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>.</p>
<p>The next line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le Q \le 100\, 000$</span>), the number of ranges to count
    cards in. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>
    lines each contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le l \le r \le 10^9$</span>), the integer range given in a
    question.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[l,
    r]$</span>, output the number of cards with an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$l \le x \le r$</span>.</p>
