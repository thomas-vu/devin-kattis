<p>The lunch break just started! Your mother gave you one litre
    of pink lemonade. You do not like pink lemonade and want blue
    lemonade instead. Fortunately for you the other children in
    class are willing to trade with you.</p>
<p>Each of them is willing to offer you any quantity of the
    virtually infinite amount of lemonade they got from their
    mother, in exchange for their favourite lemonade, according to
    some <em>exchange rate</em>. The other children are sitting in
    a long row in the class room and you will walk along the row,
    passing each child only once. You are not allowed to walk back!
    Of course, you want to maximise the amount of blue lemonade you
    end up with. In case you can obtain more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> litres of blue lemonade, this is
    more than you will need, and you will throw away any excess
    (and keep the <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    litres).</p>
<p>Fortunately, you know in advance what everybody is offering
    for trade. Your task is to write a program to find the maximum
    amount of blue lemonade that you can obtain.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of the following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq N \leq 10^5$</span>, the number of
        children in the class room, excluding yourself;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, each
        containing two strings <span class="tex2jax_process">$O,
        W$</span> and a floating point number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.5 &lt; R &lt; 2$</span>, the name of
        the lemonade that is offered, the name of the lemonade that
        is wanted, and the exchange rate: for every litre of
        lemonade <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> that you
        trade you get <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>
        litres of lemonade <span class="tex2jax_process">$O$</span>
        in return. Exchange rates are given with at most
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> digits after the
        decimal point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All strings are guaranteed to have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> alphanumeric characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing a single floating point
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, the maximum
    amount (in litres) of blue lemonade that you can obtain. In
    case you could obtain more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> litres, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> is considered to be <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. You are required to output
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> with absolute
    precision <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
