<p>As we all know, Brexit negotiations are on their way—but we
    still do not know whether they will actually finish in
    time.</p>
<p>The negotiations will take place topic-by-topic. To organise
    the negotiations in the most effective way, the topics will all
    be discussed and finalised in separate meetings, one meeting at
    a time.</p>
<p>This system exists partly because there are (non-cyclic)
    dependencies between some topics: for example, one cannot have
    a meaningful talk about tariffs before deciding upon the
    customs union. The EU can decide on any order in which to
    negotiate the topics, as long as the mentioned dependencies are
    respected and all topics are covered.</p>
<p>Each of the topics will be discussed at length using every
    available piece of data, including key results from past
    meetings. At the start of each meeting, the delegates will take
    one extra minute for each of the meetings that has already
    happened by that point, even unrelated ones, to recap the
    discussions and understand how their conclusions were reached.
    See Figure 1 for an example.</p>
<p>Nobody likes long meetings. The EU would like you to help
    order the meetings in a way such that the longest meeting takes
    as little time as possible.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 4 \cdot 10^5$</span>), the
        number of topics to be discussed. The topics are numbered
        from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines,
        describing the negotiation topics.</p>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th such line
        starts with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_
        i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq e_ i \leq
        10^6$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq d_ i
        &lt; n$</span>), the number of minutes needed to reach a
        conclusion on topic <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and the number of other
        specific topics that must be dealt with before topic
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> can be
        discussed.</p>
<p>The remainder of the line has <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span> distinct integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_{i,1}, \ldots ,
        b_{i,d_{i}}$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le
        b_{i,j} \le n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_{i,j} \ne i$</span> for each
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>), the list of
        topics that need to be completed before topic <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is guaranteed that there are no cycles in the topic
    dependencies, and that the sum of <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span> over all topics is at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4 \cdot 10^5$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum possible length of the longest of all
    meetings, if meetings are arranged optimally according to the
    above rules.</p>
