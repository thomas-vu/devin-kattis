<div class="problembody">
<p>You want to design a level for a computer game. The level
    can be described as a connected undirected graph with vertices
    numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. In the game, the
    player’s character is dropped at one of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> vertices uniformly at random and
    their goal is to reach the exit located at vertex <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> as quickly as possible. Traversing
    an edge takes exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    second.</p>

<div class="caption">
<b>Figure 1</b>: Illustration of Sample Output 3, a level
          where the average optimal time to reach vertex
          <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{7}{4}$</span>.
        </div>
</center>
</div>
<p>The difficulty of the level is determined by the average
    optimal time to reach the exit. Given a target value for this
    average optimal time, construct a level so that this target
    value is reached. See Figure 1 for an example.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with two coprime integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a,b \le 1000$</span>) separated by
        a ‘<tt class="ttfamily">/</tt>’, giving the desired average
        optimal time to reach the exit as the fraction <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{a}{b}$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If no connected graph with the average optimal time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{a}{b}$</span> to reach
    vertex <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> exists, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”. Otherwise, output one
    such graph in the following format:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n, m \le 10^6$</span>), the number
        of vertices and the number of edges.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> pairs of
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le u,v \le n$</span>), indicating an
        edge between vertices <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The graph may include self loops and parallel edges. You are
    given that if there exists a valid graph, then there also
    exists one with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n, m \le
    10^6$</span>.</p>
<p>If there are multiple valid solutions, you may output any
    one of them.</p>
