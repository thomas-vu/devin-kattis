<div class="problembody">
<p>Recently, Pero has been into robotics, so he decided to make
    a robot that checks whether a deck of poker cards is
    complete.</p>
<p>He’s already done a fair share of work—he wrote a programme
    that recognizes the suits of the cards. For simplicity’s sake,
    we can assume that all cards have a suit and a number.</p>
<p>The suit of the card is one of the characters P, K, H, T,
    and the number of the card is an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span>. The robot labels each card in
    the format <span class="tex2jax_process">$TXY$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> is the suit and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$XY$</span> is the number. If the
    card’s number consists of one digit, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$X = 0$</span>. For example, the card of suit
    P and number <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> is
    labelled <tt class="ttfamily">P09</tt>.</p>
<p>A complete deck has <span class="tex2jax_process">$52$</span> cards in total—for each of the
    four suits there is exactly one card with a number between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span>.</p>
<p>The robot has read the labels of all the cards in the deck
    and combined them into the string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>. Help Pero finish the robot by
    writing a programme that reads the string made out of card
    labels and outputs how many cards are missing for each suit. If
    there are two exact same cards in the deck, output <tt class="ttfamily">GRESKA</tt> (Croatian for ERROR).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains the string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq \left|S\right| \leq 1\ 000$</span>),
    containing all the card labels.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If there are two exact same cards in the deck, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">GRESKA</tt>”. Otherwise, the first and
    only line of output must consist of 4 space-separated numbers:
    how many cards of the suit P, K, H, T are missing,
    respectively.</p>
