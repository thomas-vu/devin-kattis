</div>Sean’s Swathers makes custom swathers (equipment used to
    harvest grain). All swathers go through the same basic stages
    in their construction: for example they all need to have a
    cutting bar, a grain belt, and a reel fitted. However, these
    components can be customized based on the buyer’s needs, so
    these various stages may take different amounts of time between
    different swathers.

    <p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> swathers have been
    ordered and there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    stages in the manufacturing process. The swathers will each go
    through the same sequence of stages.</p>
<p>In particular, the processing occurs as follows: For each
    swather <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and each stage
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, it takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_{i,j}$</span> units of time to complete
    stage <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> for swather
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. The workers at each
    stage may only work on one swather at a time. At the start of
    the day all swather orders are ready to be processed by the
    first stage. At any point in the process, if the workers at
    stage <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> are idle and
    there are swathers waiting to be processed at this stage then
    the workers will pick the swather that has the lowest label
    (they are labelled from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>). Note that the work on a stage
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> can only be started
    after the work on the stage <span class="tex2jax_process">$j-1$</span> is completed.</p>
<p>Determine the time each swather is completed.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There is only one test case in each file. It begins with a
    single line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N,M \leq 1000$</span>), the number of
    swathers and stages (respectively). Following this are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, each with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> integers. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>’th integer of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th line is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_{i,j}$</span>, giving the
    amount of time it will take for the workers at stage
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> to complete swather
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq P_{i,j} \leq 10^6$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_1~ T_2~ \ldots ~ T_ n$</span> with a
    single space between consecutive integers. These should be such
    that stage <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> for swather
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is completed at time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ i$</span>.</p>
