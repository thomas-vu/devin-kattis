<p>What happens when more teams want to go to an ICPC regional
    site than the site has capacity for? Who goes there?</p>
<p>One possible policy is the following: Every school is
    allowed to register as many teams as they wish. Accept every
    school’s first team, then accept every school’s second team
    (for schools with more than one team), then third, and so on,
    until all teams are accepted, or there isn’t enough capacity
    for the next wave. Then, if there are extra spots available,
    the spots are given to schools, one by one, in the order that
    the schools registered.</p>
<p>Given the capacity of a site, the number of teams registered
    by each school and the order that they registered, determine
    how many teams from each school are accepted.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 100$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le m \le 100$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the capacity of the site and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number of
    schools that wish to compete there.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le t \le 100$</span>), which is the number of teams that a
    school has registered. The schools are listed in the order that
    they registered.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, one
    for each school. Each line must contain a single integer
    indicating the number of teams accepted from that school.
    Output them in the same order as they appear in the input.</p>
