<div class="problembody">
<p>Working for the Texas Spy Agency, you are in charge of
    writing software for handling secure communications between
    your clients who wish to pass you messages without anyone else
    being able to read them. Therefore, you have been commissioned
    to write a program which takes messages and encrypts them
    according to a key that you have. The spy agency is not very
    technologically advanced, and everything has been done by hand
    until now, which is why you were hired. Thus, their codes are
    also fairly simple – they’re just character permutations.</p>
<p>A permutation of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, as you know, is a list of the
    numbers 1 through <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> but
    in some rearranged order. So “1 2 3” is a permutation of length
    3, and so is “2 1 3”, but “5 3 6 4 1 2” is a permutation of
    length 6. Notice that every number between 1 and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> appears in the permutation.</p>
<p>A key is a permutation which is used to change the message.
    For instance, the key “1 2 3 4 5” is a permutation of length 5
    which does absolutely nothing – an encrypted message and a
    decrypted message would be identical. The key “2 1” would
    reverse every two characters. So the phrase ‘I like ice cream’
    would be encrypted as ‘ Iileki ecc erma’. The key “5 1 4 2 3”
    would encrypt the word ‘howdy’ as ‘yhdow’.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, if the message is longer than the key,
    just keep applying the key to each set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> characters. One last example. If
    the key is “4 1 3 5 2 6”, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is 6, and we would encrypt the
    message “Four score and seven years ago” as (spaces, vertical
    bars, and single quotes are added for clarity):</p>

<small class="small">index:      1 2 3 4 5 6|1 2 3 4 5 6|1 2 3 4 5 6|1 2 3 4 5 6|1 2 3 4 5 6|1 2 3 4 5 6
message:   'F o u r   s|c o r e   a|n d   s e v|e n   y e a|r s   a g o|.          '
key:        4 1 3 5 2 6|4 1 3 5 2 6|4 1 3 5 2 6|4 1 3 5 2 6|4 1 3 5 2 6|4 1 3 5 2 6
encrypted: 'r F u   o s|e c r   o a|s n   e d v|y e   e n a|a r   g s o|  .        '
</small>
</pre>Note from this example that if the message length is not a
multiple of the key length, your program should pad the original
message with extra spaces at the end so that the message length is
a multiple of the key length.

    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input to your program is a list of up to 150 messages to
    encrypt. Each message has two lines (one for the key, one for
    the message content). The first line starts with an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 20$</span>, the
    length of the key, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers which form the
    permutation. The second line contains the message content. Your
    program should encrypt everything on the second line, spaces
    and all. Input ends when <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each message, pad the input with spaces as necessary,
    encrypt the message with the key, and output the encrypted
    message. Include single quotes around the encrypted
    message.</p>
