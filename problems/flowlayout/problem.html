<div class="problembody">
<p>A flow layout manager takes rectangular objects and places
    them in a rectangular window from left to right. If there isn’t
    enough room in one row for an object, it is placed completely
    below all the objects in the first row at the left edge, where
    the order continues from left to right again. Given a set of
    rectangular dimensions and a maximum window width, you are to
    write a program that computes the dimensions of the final
    window after all the rectangles have been placed in it.</p>
<p>For example, given a window that can be at most 35 units
    wide, and three rectangles with dimensions <span class="tex2jax_process">$10 \times 5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$20 \times 12$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$8 \times 13$</span>, the flow layout manager
    would create a window that looked like the figures below after
    each rectangle was added.</p>
<div class="figure">
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth ]{fig1a.png}" src="/problems/flowlayout/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:30.00%"/>   <img alt="\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth ]{fig1b.png}" src="/problems/flowlayout/file/statement/en/img-0002.png" style="width:30.00%"/>   <img alt="\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth ]{fig1c.png}" src="/problems/flowlayout/file/statement/en/img-0003.png" style="width:30.00%"/>
</center>
</div>
<p>The final dimensions of the resulting window are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$30 \times 25$</span>, since the
    width of the first row is <span class="tex2jax_process">$10+20
    = 30$</span> and the combined height of the first and second
    rows is <span class="tex2jax_process">$12+13 = 25$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one or more sets of data, followed by
    a final line containing only the value <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>. Each data set starts with a line containing
    an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le 80$</span>, which is
    the maximum width of the resulting window. This is followed by
    at least one and at most 15 lines, each containing the
    dimensions of one rectangle, width first, then height. The end
    of the list of rectangles is signaled by the pair <tt class="ttfamily">-1 -1</tt>, which is not counted as the dimensions
    of an actual rectangle. Each rectangle is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> units wide (inclusive) and between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> units high (inclusive).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input set print the width of the resulting window,
    followed by a space, then the lowercase letter “<tt class="ttfamily">x</tt>”, followed by a space, then the height of the
    resulting window.</p>
