<p>Christmas comes sooner every year. In fact, in one
    oft-forgotten corner of the world, gift-giving has already
    started in the form of a <em>Secret Santa</em> syndicate.</p>
<p>Everybody in the small town of Haircombe is going to put
    their name into a hat. This hat will be given a hearty shuffle,
    and then afterwards everybody will take turns once more in
    taking a name back from the hat.</p>
<p>The name each person receives is the name of the fellow
    citizen to whom they will send a gift.</p>
<p>Of course, one concern with this strategy is that some
    unfortunate citizens could wind up giving gifts to themselves.
    What are the chances that this will happen to any of the
    citizens of Haircombe?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 10^{12}$</span>), the number
        of citizens who will take part in Secret Santa.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing one real number; the probability
        that one or more people wind up giving gifts to
        themselves.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All output must be accurate to an absolute or relative error
    of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
