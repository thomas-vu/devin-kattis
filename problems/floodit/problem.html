<p>Flood-It is a popular one player game on many smart phones.
    The player is given an <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \times
    n$</span> board of tiles where each tile is given one of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> colours (numbered
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>â€“<span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>). Each tile is connected to up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> adjacent tiles in the
    North, South, East, and West directions. A tile is connected to
    the origin (the tile in the upper left corner) if it has the
    same colour as the origin and there is a path to the origin
    consisting only of tiles of this colour.</p>
<p>A player makes a move by choosing one of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> colours. After the choice is made,
    all tiles that are connected to the origin are changed to the
    chosen colour. The game proceeds until all tiles have the same
    colour. The goal of the game is to change all the tiles to the
    same colour, preferably with the fewest number of moves
    possible.</p>
<p>It has been proven that finding the optimal moves is a very
    hard problem. For this problem, you will simulate a very simple
    greedy strategy to see how well it works:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>for each move, choose the colour that will result in the
        largest number of tiles connected to the origin;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if there is a tie, break ties by choosing the lowest
        numbered colour.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To illustrate this, we look at the first test case in the
    sample input, the original board is:</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth ]{fig1.pdf}" src="/problems/floodit/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:20.00%"/>
</center>
<p>If we choose colour <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>
    for the first move, the result will be:</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth ]{fig2.pdf}" src="/problems/floodit/file/statement/en/img-0002.png" style="width:20.00%"/>
</center>
<p>where the tiles connected to the origin are shaded. In the
    next move, we choose colour <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> because we can increase the number
    of tiles connected to the origin by <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> tiles:</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.2\textwidth ]{fig3.pdf}" src="/problems/floodit/file/statement/en/img-0003.png" style="width:20.00%"/>
</center>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of
    input is a single integer, not more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>, indicating the number of test
    cases to follow. Each case starts with a line containing the
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 20$</span>). The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> characters, giving the
    initial colours of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \times
    n$</span> board of tiles. Each colour is specified by a digit
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, display two lines of output. The first line
    specifies the number of moves needed to change all the tiles to
    the same colour. The second line specifies <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> integers separated by a single
    space. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th integer
    gives the number of times colour <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is chosen as a move in the
    game.</p>
