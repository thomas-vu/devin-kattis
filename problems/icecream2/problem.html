<p>The Better Get Obese (BGO) ice cream factory is gearing up
    for the holiday season, and after several years with mediocre
    sales, they have decided to focus only on their most popular
    product, ice cream with flavour of chocolate and vanilla.</p>
<p>In order to make a perfect such ice cream, it is important
    that the mixing machine receives equal amounts of vanilla and
    chocolate ice cream.</p>
<p>There are two separate creaming machines in the factory
    which produce respectively chocolate and vanilla ice cream, and
    the resulting creamy goodness is stored in two separate tanks.
    From there, it can be transported to the mixing machine through
    pipes, however the dimension of a pipe gives an upper bound for
    how much ice cream can pass through it each minute. These pipes
    meet in welding points, where streams of ice cream go from one
    pipe to another. Streams can also merge or split into other
    streams at such points, if more than two pipes meet here. It is
    not important to keep the flavors separate during the
    transportation, since they will eventually be mixed
    anyways.</p>
<p>Given a map of the pipe system, can you decide how many
    liters of ice cream the factory can produce each minute?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \leq n \leq 200$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq m \leq 1\, 000$</span>), respectively the number of
    welding points, and the number of pipes. The second line
    contains three distinct integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq f, c, v \leq n$</span>), the welding points where
    respectively the mixing machine, the chocolate tank and the
    vanilla tank is connected to the pipe system.</p>
<p>Finally follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text
    {th}}$</span> of which contains three non-negative integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq u_ i, v_ i \leq n$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x_ i \leq 1\,
    000$</span>). These indicate that there is a pipe between
    welding points <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_ i$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> with a capacity for
    transporting <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> liters
    of ice cream per minute. Note that several pipes can go in
    parallel between the same welding points.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single integer, the maximum amount of ice cream the BGO
    factory can produce each minute (in liters).</p>
