<p>Sonja the scout is taking a test to see if she knows all the
    knots a scout is supposed to know. The Scoutâ€™s Big Book of
    Knots has descriptions of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\,
    000$</span> different knots, conveniently numbered from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>. For the test, Sonja needs
    to learn a specific set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> of these knots. After some intense
    studying, she has learned all except one of them, but she has
    forgotten which knot she does not yet know.</p>
<p>Given the list of knots Sonja needs to learn, and the ones
    she has learned so far, find the remaining knot to learn.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le n \le 50$</span>), the number of knots Sonja needs to
    learn. This is followed by a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> distinct integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, \ldots , x_ n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le x_ i \le 1\, 000$</span>), the knots
    that Sonja needs to learn. Finally, the last line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> distinct integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1, \ldots , y_{n-1}$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le y_ i \le 1\,
    000$</span>), the knots that Sonja has learned so far. You may
    assume that each knot Sonja has learned is one of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> knots she was supposed
    to learn.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of the remaining knot that Sonja needs to
    learn.</p>
