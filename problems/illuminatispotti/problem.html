<p>One of Xxayvierâ€™s favorite pastimes is spotting triangles
    due to his obsession with the Illuminati. Xxayvier has taken it
    to the extreme and has been trying to spot triangles on the
    larger scale.</p>
<p>He believes that the Illuminati has control of all cities
    which have <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> undirected
    flights connecting to each other in a triangle shape. To test
    this theory, Xxayvier has been making maps listing undirected
    flights that connect from city <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to city <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>. He then tries to find the
    triangles from the map afterwards.</p>
<p>Because of the large number of cities that Xxayvier has
    listed, it has been very difficult keeping track and finding
    them all. Can you help him find the number of triangles made
    without duplicates?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N+1$</span>
    lines. The first contains the number of cities that you are
    given <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 500$</span>). The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> input lines represent
    a city <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and the
    undirected flight that connects to another city <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>. Each line has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> numbers each number representing a
    city <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> in ascending
    order. Each number can be either a <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> in which a flight towards city
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> exists or a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> meaning the flight
    does not exist.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Given that the triangles are created only by <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> connecting cities, output the
    number of triangles the map can have without repeats.</p>
