<p>The Japanese game of Shiritori is the perfect 2-player game
    for a long car ride. The rules are simple: the first player
    picks any word to say, then the second player must choose a new
    word that begins with the last letter of the word that the
    first player just said. Then it is the first player’s turn
    again to say a word that begins with the last letter of the
    previous word the second player said, and so on. At each turn,
    the player whose turn it is must say a word that links to the
    previous one <em>and</em> which has not been called out before
    during the game. Your job is to determine if the game was
    played according to these rules, given a history of the words
    used in a particular game. In a game, player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> always starts first.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of one test case that begins with an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 100\, 000$</span>) on a single
    line. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> word. The words are presented in
    the order in which the players called them out, starting with
    player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. All words
    consist of between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$120$</span> lowercase English
    letters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the game was played according to the rules, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">Fair Game</tt>”. Otherwise, find out
    which player first violated the rules of the game. That player
    lost the game, so output “<tt class="ttfamily">Player &lt;i&gt;
    lost</tt>”. For example, if player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> violated the rules first, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">Player 1 lost</tt>”.</p>
