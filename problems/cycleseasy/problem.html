<div class="problembody">
<p><em>Note that this is an easier version of the problem
    cycleshard</em>.</p>
<p>You are given a complete undirected graph with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> nodes numbered from 1 to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. You are also given
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> <i class="it">forbidden</i> edges in this graph.</p>
<p>You are asked to find the number of Hamiltonian cycles in
    this graph that donâ€™t use any of the given <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> edges. A Hamiltonian cycle is a
    cycle that visits each vertex exactly once. A cycle that
    contains the same <i class="it">edges</i> is only counted once.
    For example, cycles 1 2 3 4 1 and 1 4 3 2 1 and 2 3 4 1 2 are
    all the same, but 1 3 2 4 1 is different.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input gives the number of cases,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases follow. The first line
    of each test case contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines contain two integers each,
    representing the vertices of a forbidden edge. There will be no
    self-edges and no repeated edges.</p>
<p>You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T
    \leq 10$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq k \leq
    15$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq n \leq
    10$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing "Case
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>: <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>", where <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is the case number (starting from
    1) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> is the number
    of Hamiltonian cycles that do not include any of those
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> edges. Print your
    answer modulo 9901.</p>
