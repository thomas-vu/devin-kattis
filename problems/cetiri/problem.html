<div class="problembody">
<p>Mirko has chosen four integers which form an arithmetic
    progression. In other words, when the four numbers are sorted,
    then the difference between each pair of <b class="bfseries">adjacent</b> elements is <b class="bfseries">constant</b>.</p>
<p>As has become usual, Mirko <b class="bfseries">lost</b> one
    of the numbers and also is not sure whether the remaining three
    are in the correct (sorted) order.</p>
<p>Write a program that, given the three remaining numbers,
    finds the fourth number.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains 3 integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$-100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> on a single line, separated by
    single spaces.</p>
<p><b class="bfseries">Note:</b> the input data will guarantee
    that a solution, although not necessarily unique, will always
    exist.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output any number which could have been the fourth number in
    the sequence.</p>
