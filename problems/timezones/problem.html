<p>Prior to the late nineteenth century, time keeping was a
    purely local phenomenon. Each town would set their clocks to
    noon when the sun reached its zenith each day. A clockmaker or
    town clock would be the “official” time and the citizens would
    set their pocket watches and clocks to the time of the town –
    enterprising citizens would offer their services as mobile
    clock setters, carrying a watch with the accurate time to
    adjust the clocks in customer’s homes on a weekly basis. Travel
    between cities meant having to change one’s pocket watch upon
    arrival.</p>
<p>However, once railroads began to operate and move people
    rapidly across great distances, time became much more critical.
    In the early years of the railroads, the schedules were very
    confusing because each stop was based on a different local
    time. The standardization of time was essential to efficient
    operation of railroads.</p>
<p>In 1878, Canadian Sir Sanford Fleming proposed the system of
    worldwide time zones that we use today. He recommended that the
    world be divided into twenty-four time zones, each spaced
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> degrees of longitude
    apart. Since the earth rotates once every <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span> hours and there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$360$</span> degrees of longitude, each hour
    the earth rotates one-twenty-fourth of a circle or <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> degrees of longitude. Sir
    Fleming’s time zones were heralded as a brilliant solution to a
    chaotic problem worldwide.</p>
<p>United States railroad companies began utilizing Fleming’s
    standard time zones on November 18, 1883. In 1884 an
    International Prime Meridian Conference was held in Washington
    D.C. to standardize time and select the Prime Meridian. The
    conference selected the longitude of Greenwich, England as zero
    degrees longitude and established the <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span> time zones based on the Prime
    Meridian. Although the time zones had been established, not all
    countries switched immediately. Though most U.S. states began
    to adhere to the Pacific, Mountain, Central, and Eastern time
    zones by 1895, Congress didn’t make the use of these time zones
    mandatory until the Standard Time Act of 1918.</p>
<p>Today, many countries operate on variations of the time
    zones proposed by Sir Fleming. All of China (which should span
    five time zones) uses a single time zone - eight hours ahead of
    Coordinated Universal Time (known by the abbreviation UTC –
    based on the time zone running through Greenwich at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> degrees longitude).
    Russia adheres to its designated time zones although the entire
    country is on permanent Daylight Saving Time and is an hour
    ahead of their actual zones. Australia uses three time zones –
    its central time zone is a half-hour ahead of its designated
    time zone. Several countries in the Middle East and South Asia
    also utilize half-hour time zones.</p>
<p>Since time zones are based on segments of longitude and
    lines of longitude narrow at the poles, scientists working at
    the North and South Poles simply use UTC time. Otherwise,
    Antarctica would be divided into <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span> very thin time zones!</p>

<p>Given the current time in one time zone, you are to compute
    what time it is in another time zone.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 250$</span>, the number of test
    cases. For each case a line is given with a time, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> time zone
    abbreviations. Time is given in standard a.m./p.m. format with
    midnight denoted “midnight” and noon denoted “noon” (12:00 a.m.
    and 12:00 p.m. are oxymorons).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, assuming the given time is the current
    time in the first time zone, give the current time in the
    second time zone.</p>
