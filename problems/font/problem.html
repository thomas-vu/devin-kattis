<p>Little Ivica got himself a summer job at a company that
    produces computer fonts. The branch of the company where Ivica
    works at specialises in testing computer fonts and Ivica’s team
    is responsible of testing only lowercase letters of the English
    alphabet.</p>
<p>The letters are tested so that various sentences using those
    letters are printed out and then manually (more accurately,
    visually) checked if everything is arranged properly. Only
    sentences which contain all 26 lowercase letter of the English
    alphabet (a–z) are used for testing purposes. These sentences
    are called test sentences.</p>
<p>You’ve probably already assumed that Ivica’s job is to find
    test sentences. He has a dictionary which consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> words and has to
    calculate how many different test sentences can be made out of
    those words. Every word from the dictionary can be used only
    once in the sentence and the order of the words in the sentence
    is irrelevant (i.e. “uvijek jedem sarmu” and “jedem sarmu
    uvijek” are equal sentences).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq N \leq 25)$</span>, the number of words in the dictionary.
    Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines contains a single word from the dictionary, its length
    not exceeding 100. All the words from the dictionary are going
    to be unique.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the required
    number from the task.</p>
