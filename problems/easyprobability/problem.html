<p>As a Hunter, you will undoubtedly face difficult obstacles
    during your journey. At such time, a Hunter is expected to
    model the situation using Mathematical models, and apply
    probability and statistics knowledge to overcome the
    situation.</p>
<p>Thus, the third round of the Hunter Exam is based on the
    following game with coins:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Before the game starts, Gon selects a string
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> and Killua selects
        a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>. The two
        strings must contain only characters ‘H’ and ‘T’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A game master will flip a coin an infinite number of
        times. After each flip, the result (either ‘H’ or
        ‘T’ — representing head or tail) is appended into a
        string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>. The string
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is empty at the
        beginning of the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After some coin flip:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If both <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> and
            <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> become a
            substring of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>,
            the game ends in a draw.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If only <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>
            becomes a substring of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, Gon wins, and the game
            ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If only <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
            becomes a substring of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, Killua wins, and the game
            ends.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gon and Killua only have finite amount of time. They
        will stop the game in a draw after <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{100}$</span> turns.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Please calculate the probability that Gon wins.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains exactly three lines:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains the string <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second line contains the string <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The third line contains a real number <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> with exactly one digit after
        the decimal point — the probability that a coin flip
        will result in head <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0 &lt;
        p &lt; 1)$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The length of <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> are at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> are non-empty, and contain only
    characters ‘H’ and ‘T’.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output must contain a single number — the
    probability that Gon wins.</p>
<p>Your answer will be considered correct if its relative or
    absolute error doesn’t exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
<p>Namely: let’s assume that your answer is <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, and the answer of the jury is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. The checker program
    will consider your answer correct, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{|a-b|}{max(1,b)} \leq
    10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
