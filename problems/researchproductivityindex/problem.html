</div>Angela is a new PhD student and she is nervous about the
    upcoming paper submission deadline of this year’s research
    conference. She has been working on multiple projects
    throughout the past year. Luckily most of the projects
    concluded successfully, and she came up with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> candidate papers. However not all
    of the papers were born equal—some have better results than
    others. Her advisor believes she should only submit the papers
    with “good enough” results so they have a high chance of
    getting accepted.
    <p>Angela’s research group has a unique way of evaluating the
    success of paper submissions. They use the <em>research
    productivity index</em>, defined as <span class="tex2jax_process">$a^{a/s}$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is the total number of papers
    submitted, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is the
    number of papers that are accepted by the conference. When
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a = 0$</span>, the index is
    defined to be zero. For example:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>if one paper is submitted and it gets accepted, the
        index is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1^{1/1} =
        1$</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> papers are
        submitted and all get accepted, the index is <span class="tex2jax_process">$4^{4/4} = 4$</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> papers are
        submitted and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> get
        accepted, the index is <span class="tex2jax_process">$3^{3/10} \approx 1.390389$</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> papers are
        submitted and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> get
        accepted, the index is <span class="tex2jax_process">$4^{4/5} \approx 3.031433$</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> papers are
        submitted and all get rejected (<span class="tex2jax_process">$a=0$</span>), the index is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Intuitively, to get a high research productivity index one
    wants to get as many papers accepted as possible while keeping
    the acceptance rate high.</p>
<p>For each of her <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    papers, Angela knows exactly how likely it is that the
    conference would accept the paper. If she chooses wisely which
    papers to submit, what is the maximum expected value of her
    research productivity index?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input has a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100$</span>), the number of
    Angela’s candidate papers. The next line has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space-separated integers giving
    the probability of each paper getting accepted. Each
    probability value is given as an integer percentage between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum expected value of Angela’s research
    productivity index. Your answer is considered correct if it has
    an absolute or relative error of no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
