<div class="problembody">
<p>Marek is a boss of a fruit company and he sometimes has
    crazy ideas. He wants to introduce a new product – fruit
    baskets. They will contain all possible combinations of fruits
    to satisfy different customer needs, but at most one piece of
    each fruit. He doesn’t want to have small fruit baskets, so all
    must contain at least 200 grams of fruit.</p>
<p>You have tolerated his crazy ideas before, but you can’t put
    up with this one. You realized that the company might end up
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^ N-1$</span> different
    baskets, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the
    number of fruits the company sells. You know that Keram will
    not understand this argument, so you are going to convince him
    in a different way. You want to tell him the total weight of
    fruit in the baskets and tell him that he will need a lot of
    trucks just to carry all baskets from the collection.</p>
<p>For simplicity, you may assume that all fruits of the same
    kind weigh the same. You also know that all fruits weigh at
    least 50 grams.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N, 1\leq N\leq 40$</span>. The second line
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers –
    weights of available fruits in grams. All weights are integers
    between 50 and 1000.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with one integer – the total weight of all
    fruit in the baskets that have at least 200 grams of fruit.</p>
