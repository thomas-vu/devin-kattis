<p>Your task is to implement a <em>binary max-heap</em>
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap</a>)
    in C++.</p>
<p>Your heap should have the time complexities <span class="tex2jax_process">$O(\log n)$</span> for the insert and remove
    operations, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$O(1)$</span> for
    the size and maximum operations.</p>
<h2>Template</h2>
<p>You can download the template <tt class="ttfamily">heap.cpp</tt> that you should implement from the
    Attachments menu.</p>
<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>To test your program, download the <tt class="ttfamily">heap.h</tt> file from the Attachments menu and put
    it in the same directory as your solution.</p>
