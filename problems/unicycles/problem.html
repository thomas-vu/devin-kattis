<p>Going to circus college is not as fun as you were led to
    believe. You are juggling so many classes. Trapeze class is
    sometimes up, sometimes down. There’s a lot of tension in your
    high-wire class. And you’ve seen that lion taming can be
    cat-astrophic.</p>
<p>The one pleasure you find is in riding unicycles with your
    fellow classmates. Many people have unicycles with different
    sized wheels. One day you notice that all their tires leave a
    small mark on the ground, once per rotation. You decide to
    amuse yourself and avoid your classwork by trying to determine
    how many unicycles have passed by on a given stretch of road.
    In fact, you want to know the minimum number of unique
    unicycles that could have left the marks you observe. You make
    the simplifying assumption that any unicycle riding on the road
    will ride completely from the beginning to the end.</p>
<p>The figures below illustrate the sample input. Each thick
    black vertical stripe represents a mark left by a tire.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each line of input represents the observations on a stretch
    of road. A line begins with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> represents the length of the road
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> represents the
    number of marks you observe on the road. These are followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> unique integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_ n$</span>,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a_ i &lt; m$</span>
    for all <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>. These
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers represent the
    positions where you observed a unicycle’s tire has left a mark.
    There will be at most 100 lines of input. Input ends at end of
    file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each set of observations, print the minimum number of
    unicycles that could have produced the observed marks.</p>
