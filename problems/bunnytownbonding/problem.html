<p>As long as anyone can remember, Bunny Town has been home to
    many happy and friendly bunnies living together peacefully.
    However, a recent misunderstanding has led to serious disputes
    and relationship issues. Now most of the bunnies have stopped
    talking to each other, and even try to avoid being near each
    other in public places. Deeply concerned by this unpleasant
    development, the King of Bunny Town has instituted several
    guidelines to restore community bonding. One of the guidelines
    states: <em>“Bunnies should not allow any vacant seat(s) among
    themselves when two or more bunnies sit in a row in an
    entertainment venue such as a theater.”</em> You are a Bunny
    Town volunteer who has been selected by the King to oversee the
    implementation of this guideline. Your job is to find bunnies
    sitting in a row of seats, and then move individual bunnies
    until there are no empty seats among them, while keeping
    overall movements to a minimum. That is, given a row of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> seats specified by a
    sequence of <b class="bfseries"><tt class="ttfamily">B</tt></b>’s and <b class="bfseries"><tt class="ttfamily">E</tt></b>’s, where <b class="bfseries"><tt class="ttfamily">B</tt></b> represents a seat that is occupied by a
    bunny and <b class="bfseries"><tt class="ttfamily">E</tt></b>
    represents an empty seat, find the minimum number of moves so
    that all the bunnies in the row are sitting together (i.e.,
    occupy a contiguous portion of the row). Note that moving a
    bunny one position to its immediate left or right is considered
    a single move, and also note that while moving a bunny, it can
    temporarily be located on top of another bunny, but must
    ultimately end up in a seat by itself.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a single line containing a string of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 2\, 000$</span>. The string
    consists exclusively of the characters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">E</tt>’ and ‘<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>’. The
    number of ‘<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>’ characters in the
    string is guaranteed to be at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the minimum number of moves
    required to arrange the bunnies in the row so that there are no
    empty seats among them.</p>
<h3>Explanation of Sample Input/Output 1</h3>
<p>If we move the rightmost bunny leftward <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> positions, i.e., into the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4^\mathrm {th}$</span> seat
    (counting from the left), all the bunnies are now sitting
    together, and this is the minimum number of moves possible to
    achieve this.</p>
<h3>Explanation of Sample Input/Output 2</h3>
<p>One solution is to move the bunny in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1^\mathrm {st}$</span> seat (counting from
    the left) <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> positions rightward into the
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$9^\mathrm {th}$</span> seat,
    move the bunny in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^\mathrm
    {nd}$</span> seat <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> positions rightward into the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^\mathrm {th}$</span> seat,
    and move the bunny in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3^\mathrm {rd}$</span> seat <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> positions rightward into the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$11^\mathrm {th}$</span> seat.
    Then the total number of moves is <span class="tex2jax_process">$8 + 8 + 8 = 24$</span>, and this is the
    minimum possible.</p>
