<p>You are a land surveyor, and you use the latest
    land-surveying technology: robotic surveyors. You have sent
    your robots to survey a remote field, since it is cheaper and
    easier to send them than to go yourself. You know that there
    are frequent sand storms that blow through the field, which can
    damage the robots. Fortunately, satellite imagery can detect
    these storms and give the robots a warning several seconds
    before a storm arrives.</p>
<p>Since the field is so exposed and remote, the only way a
    robot can protect itself is to run to a hole in the ground and
    hide. You have identified the locations of several of these
    holes, but each of them is large enough to fit only one robot.
    Any robot that doesnâ€™t make it into a hole before the storm
    arrives will be damaged.</p>
<p>Write a program that will figure out how many robots can
    escape a coming storm by running to and hiding in holes. Assume
    that each robot that can escape travels from its current
    position directly to a hole. All robots travel at a speed of 10
    meters per second.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will have multiple scenarios, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. Each scenario starts with an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; m \leq
    200$</span> indicating the number of robots in the field,
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
    indicating the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates of each
    robot. Next comes an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0&lt;n\leq 200$</span> indicating the number
    of holes, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines indicating the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates of
    each hole. All coordinates will be floating-point numbers,
    given in meters. No two holes will be at the same location, and
    no two robots will be at the same location. The end of input is
    signified by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m=0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each scenario, print the scenario number, and print how
    many robots could escape in 5 seconds, in 10 seconds, and in 20
    seconds. Follow the format demonstrated in the sample output
    below. Print a blank line after each scenario. You may assume
    that the answers will not change if the threshold times (5, 10,
    or 20 seconds) are perturbed by up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> seconds.</p>
