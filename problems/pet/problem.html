<p>In the popular show “Dinner for Five”, five contestants
    compete in preparing culinary delights. Every evening one of
    them makes dinner and each of other four then grades it on a
    scale from 1 to 5. The number of points a contestant gets is
    equal to the sum of grades they got. The winner of the show is
    of course the contestant that gets the most points.</p>
<p>Write a program that determines the winner and how many
    points they got.</p>
