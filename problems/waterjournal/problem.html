<div class="problembody">
<p>Every day, Eugene logs how many cups of water he drank. He
    forgot to log one entry in his journal though, but he remembers
    the minimum number and maximum number of cups of water he drank
    every day since he started logging his journal, and that there
    was at least one day where he drank the minimum and one day
    where he drank the maximum. Compute all possible amounts of
    cups of water he could have imbibed on the day he forgot to
    log.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le n \le 50$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a \le b \le 50$</span>), where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of days
    in Eugene’s log, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is
    the minimum number of cups of water he drank on any day, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> is the associated
    maximum.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>
    lines contains a single integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$a
    \le w \le b$</span>). These are the entries in Eugene’s log for
    every day except the day he forgot to log an entry.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output in increasing order, all of the possible values for
    the missing entry separated by whitespace, or simply output -1
    if Eugene’s memory is faulty and it isn’t possible.</p>
