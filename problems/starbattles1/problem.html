<p>A Star Battle (of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>-star variety), also known as “Two
    Not Touch” as published by <i class="itshape">The New York
    Times</i>, is a solitary star-placement puzzle played on a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\times 10$</span> grid. The
    grid is divided into exactly ten <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-connected regions, and the
    objective is to place exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> stars in the grid, each in its
    own cell, such that following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Every row, column, and region of the grid contains
        exactly two stars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No two stars are in adjacent cells, i.e. cells next to
        each other horizontally, vertically, <em>or
        diagonally</em>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an example of a Star Battle puzzle,<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> where regions are delimited by bold
    lines. The unique solution to this puzzle is shown on the
    right.</p>

<p>Given a description of a Star Battle puzzle and a candidate
    solution, your task for this problem is to write a program that
    will determine whether or not the candidate is indeed a valid
    solution to the puzzle. The input to your program is guaranteed
    to be a valid Star Battle puzzle with a unique solution.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> lines of
    input contain a description of the Star Battle puzzle. Every
    line contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    digits, where the digit names the region to which its cell
    belongs. There will be exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> contiguous, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-connected (i.e. left, right, top,
    bottom, but not diagonal) regions in the puzzle.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> lines of
    input contain a description of the candidate solution. Every
    line contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    characters, each a ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’ to indicate an
    empty cell or a ‘<tt class="ttfamily">*</tt>’ to indicate
    placement of a star.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the candidate solution is consistent with all the Star
    Battle rules for the provided puzzle, output the word “valid”
    on a single line. Otherwise, output “invalid”.</p>
