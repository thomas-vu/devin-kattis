<p>Each employee of a bureaucracy has a <em>job
    description</em> – a few paragraphs that describe the
    responsibilities of the job. The employee’s job description,
    combined with other factors, such as seniority, is used to
    determine his or her salary.</p>
<p>The <em>Hay Point</em> system frees the Human Resources
    department from having to make an intelligent judgement as to
    the value of the employee; the job description is merely
    scanned for words and phrases that indicate responsibility. In
    particular, job descriptions that indicate control over a large
    budget or management over a large number of people yield high
    Hay Point scores.</p>
<p>You are to implement a simplified Hay Point system. You will
    be given a Hay Point dictionary and a number of job
    descriptions. For each job description you are to compute the
    salary associated with the job, according to the system.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains 2 positive integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m\leq 10\, 000$</span>, the
    number of words in the Hay Point dictionary, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n\leq 100$</span>, the number of job
    descriptions. <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
    follow; each contains a word (a string of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span> lower-case letters) and a dollar
    value (an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span>). The <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> words in the dictionary are
    distinct. Following the dictionary are the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> job descriptions. Each job
    description consists of between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> lines of text; for your
    convenience the text has been converted to lower case and has
    no characters other than letters, numbers, and spaces. Each
    line is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span>
    characters long. Each job description is terminated by a line
    containing a period.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each job description, output the corresponding salary
    computed as the sum of the Hay Point values for all words that
    appear in the description. Words that do not appear in the
    dictionary have a value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<p>You may assume that every answer is less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000\, 000\, 000$</span>.</p>
