<p>You have most definitely heard the legend of King Arthur and
    the Knights of the Round Table. Almost all versions of this
    story proudly point out that the roundness of the Round Table
    is closely related to Arthur’s belief of equality among the
    Knights. That is a lie! In fact, Arthur’s choice of table is
    conditioned by his childhood traumas.</p>
<p>In fact, Arthur was forced to clean up quadratic tables from
    a young age after a tournament in pick-up sticks<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> had been played on them. After the
    tournament, typically there would be a bunch of sticks on the
    table that do not touch each other. In the spirit of the game,
    the organizers issued strict regulations for the table
    cleaners. More precisely, the sticks on the table need to be
    removed one by one in a way that the cleaners pull them in the
    shortest way towards the edge of the table closest to where
    they are currently sitting. They also mustn’t rotate or touch
    the other sticks while doing this (not even in the edge
    points).</p>
<p>In this task, we will represent the table in the coordinate
    system with a square that has opposite points in the
    coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(10\, 000, 10\, 000)$</span>,
    whereas the sticks will be represented with straight line
    segments that lie within that square. We will assume that
    Arthur is sitting at the edge of the table lying on the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis. Then the
    movement of the stick comes down to translating the line
    segment along the shortest path towards the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis until the stick falls off the
    table (as shown in the image). It is your task to help Arthur
    determine the order of stick movements that meets the
    requirements from the previous paragraph.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 5\, 000$</span>), the number of sticks on the
    table. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains four integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2 \leq 10\,
    000$</span>) that denote the edge points of a stick.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain
    space-separated stick labels in the order which they need to be
    taken off the table. A stick’s label corresponds to its
    position in the input sequence.</p>
<p>If there are multiple possible solutions, output any of
    them.</p>
