<p>Around regional contest time, the Canadian branch of a
    popular fast food restaurant usually runs a game to promote its
    business. Certain food items provide stickers, and certain
    collection of different stickers can be converted to cash
    prizes. If a prize requires sticker types <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_1, T_2, \ldots , T_ k$</span>, then you
    can claim the prize if you have 1 sticker of each type
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_1, T_2, \ldots , T_ k$</span>.
    Each sticker can only be used to claim one prize. However, you
    may claim a prize multiple times if you have multiple stickers
    of the same type. No two prizes will require the same type of
    stickers. There may be some stickers that cannot be used to
    claim a cash prize (e.g. a sticker for a free milkshake).</p>
<p>On your road trip to the regional contest, your coach forced
    you to eat at this restaurant and collected all the stickers
    together. How much cash can your coach claim?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of
    input is a single integer, not more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>, indicating the number of
    test cases to follow. Each case starts with a line containing
    two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10$</span>) and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 30$</span>), where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of
    different types of prizes, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number of different types
    of stickers (the types are labelled <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \ldots , m$</span>). The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines specify the
    prizes. Each of these lines starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq k \leq m$</span>) specifying the number of sticker types
    required to claim the prize. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> integers specifying the types of
    the stickers required. The final integer on each line is the
    (positive) cash value of the prize (at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span>). The last line of
    each case gives <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    nonnegative integers, with the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th integer giving the number of
    stickers of type <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> your
    coach has collected. There are no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> stickers of each type.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, display on a single line the total value of
    the cash prizes that can be claimed.</p>
