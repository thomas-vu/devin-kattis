        An array of julmust bottles with a glass of julmust in
        front.
      </div>
</div>Maj loves the traditional Swedish Christmas soft drink
    called <em>julmust</em>. She likes it so much that she has
    convinced her local store to start selling it already on the
    1st of October!
    <p>Maj is a creature of habit. She consumes exactly the same
    number of bottles of julmust every day from the 1st of October
    until Christmas Eve (the 24th of December). The number of
    bottles per day is a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; r \leq R$</span>.</p>
<p>You need to determine the total number of julmust bottles
    she has consumed so far. You need to be done at the end of
    Christmas Eve, <span class="tex2jax_process">$85$</span> days
    after she started drinking.</p>
<p>At the end of every day, you ask Maj how much julmust she
    had so far. You can only ask one question per day.</p>
<h2>Interaction</h2>
<p>The interaction starts by giving your program a single line
    of input with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, the maximum number of bottles Maj
    could possibly consume per day. Interaction proceeds in round,
    with one round per day. In each round, your program asks if Maj
    has consumed <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> bottles
    of julmust since the 1st of October up to and including the
    current day. The format of a question is “<span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>” where <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is a non-negative integer. Thus,
    your first question “<span class="tex2jax_process">$X_1$</span>” means “Have you consumed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_1$</span> bottles on the 1st
    of October,” your second question “<span class="tex2jax_process">$X_2$</span>” means “Have you consumed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_2$</span> bottles in total on
    the 1st and 2nd of October,” and so on.</p>
<p>Maj’s response to each question can be read from standard
    input. Her response is a single line with one of the following
    three words:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>“less” if Maj has consumed strictly fewer than
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> bottles so
        far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“exact” if Maj has consumed exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> bottles so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“more” if Maj has consumed strictly more than
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> bottles so
        far.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When your program receives “exact” it has successfully
    completed the task and should exit, not asking any more
    questions.</p>
<p>Your program is judged <em>wrong</em> if you have not
    received an “exact” response after <span class="tex2jax_process">$85$</span> rounds.</p>
<h2>Flushing</h2>
<p>In interactive problems your program will be judged by a
    judge program. If your program does not flush the output stream
    when printing output the judge program might not receive your
    output in time and your program might be judged as Time Limit
    Exceeded. To avoid this, make sure to always flush your output
    after each time you print.</p>
<p>In Python3:</p>
<pre>
print(x, flush=True)
</pre>
<p>In Java:</p>
<pre>
System.out.println(x);
System.out.flush();
</pre>
<p>In C++:</p>
<pre>
std::cout &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; "\n" &lt;&lt; std::flush;
</pre>

<h2>Sample Description</h2>
<p>In Sample Interaction 1, Maj consumes 5 bottles of julmust
    each day. On the first day you ask if she has consumed 8
    bottles, but she has only consumed 5 so far. On the second day
    you ask if she has consumed 10 bottles, which is true and the
    interaction ends.</p>
<p>In Sample Interaction 2, Maj consumes 6 bottles of julmust
    each day. On the first day you ask if she has consumed 10
    bottles, but she has only consumed 6 so far. On the second day
    you ask if she has consumed 10 bottles, but now she has
    consumed 12 bottles. On the third day you ask if she has
    consumed 18 bottles, which is true and the interaction
    ends.</p>
