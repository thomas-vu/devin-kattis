<p>You’re doing some construction work, and, to save money,
    you’re using some discount, “irregular” construction materials.
    In particular, you have some blocks that are mostly
    rectangular, but with one edge that’s curvy. As illustrated
    below, you’re going to use these irregular blocks between
    stacks of ordinary blocks, so they won’t shift sideways or
    rotate. You’ll put one irregular block on the bottom, with its
    curvy edge pointing up, and another above it, with it’s curvy
    edge pointing down. You just need to know how well these blocks
    fit together. You define the fit quality as the maximum
    vertical gap between the upper edge of the bottom block and the
    lower edge of the top block when the upper block is just
    touching the lower one.</p>

<p>All blocks are one unit wide. You’ve modeled the curvy edges
    as cubic polynomials, with the left edge of the block at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = 0$</span> and the right edge
    at <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = 1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each test case is given on two lines, with each line
    containing four real numbers. The numbers on the first line,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_0~ b_1~ b_2~ b_3$</span>,
    describe the shape of the upper edge of the bottom block. This
    edge is shaped just like the polynomial <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + b_3 x^3$</span> for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x \leq 1$</span>. The
    numbers on the next input line, <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_0~ t_1~ t_2~ t_3$</span>, describe the
    bottom edge of the block that’s going on top. This edge is
    shaped just like the polynomial <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_0 + t_1 x + t_2 x^2 + t_3 x^3$</span> for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x \leq 1$</span>. No
    input value will have magnitude greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$50 000$</span>. There are at most 500 test
    cases. Input ends at end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print out a single line giving the fit
    quality. An answer is considered correct if its absolute or
    relative error is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-7}$</span>.</p>
