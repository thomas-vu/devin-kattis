<div class="problembody">
<p>A school is having a vote in what their primary school
    colour should be. While counting the votes, the principal of
    the school accidentally lost count of how many students there
    were. He then asked <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    distinct students “How many other students voted for the same
    colour as you?” where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>th student’s response is an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> representing the
    number of students that voted for the same colour. Assuming
    that the principal may or may not have asked all of the
    students this question, and each student can only vote once,
    find the minimum number of students that attend the school. For
    example: The principal asks <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> students the question. The first
    student says “<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> other
    student person voted for the same colour as me.” The second
    student says “<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> other
    student voted for the same colour as me” and the third student
    says “<span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> other students
    voted for the same colour as me.” Assuming that the minimum
    number of students would mean that the first and second student
    voted for the same colour, then these <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> students plus the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> students referenced from the third
    student makes a minimum of <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> students that attend the
    school.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of only two lines. The first line
    contains the integer number of students the principal asked,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10\, 000$</span>). The second
    line consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    students’ responses where each contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq i \leq 10\, 000$</span>) and they are separated by
    whitespaces.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum number of students located at the school
    as a single integer.</p>
