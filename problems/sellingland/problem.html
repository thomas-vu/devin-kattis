<div class="problembody">
<p>As you may know, the country of Absurdistan is full of
    abnormalities. For example, the whole country can be divided
    into unit squares that are either grass or swamp. Also, the
    country is famous for its incapable bureaucrats. If you want to
    buy a piece of land (called a parcel), you can only buy a
    rectangular area, because they cannot handle other shapes. The
    price of the parcel is determined by them and is proportional
    to the perimeter of the parcel, since the bureaucrats are
    unable to multiply integers and thus cannot calculate the area
    of the parcel.</p>
<p>Per owns a parcel in Absurdistan surrounded by swamp and he
    wants to sell it, possibly in parts, to some buyers. When he
    sells a rectangular part of his land, he is obliged to announce
    this to the local bureaucrats. They will first tell him the
    price he is supposed to sell it for. Then they will write down
    the name of the new owner and the coordinates of the south-east
    corner of the parcel being sold. If somebody else already owns
    a parcel with a south-east corner at the same spot, the
    bureaucrats will deny the change of ownership.</p>
<p>Per realizes that he can easily trick the system. He can
    sell overlapping areas, because bureaucrats only check whether
    the south-east corners are identical. However, nobody wants to
    buy a parcel containing swamp.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: In this example, dark squares represent
        swamp. Per may, for example, sell three overlapping grey
        areas, with dimensions <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\times 1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\times 4$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4\times 1$</span> respectively. The
        total perimeter is <span class="tex2jax_process">$6 + 12 +
        10=28$</span>. Note that he can get more money by selling
        even more land. This figure corresponds to the case in the
        sample input.

<p>Now Per would like to know how many parcels of each
    perimeter he needs to sell in order to maximize his profit. Can
    you help him? You may assume that he can always find a buyer
    for each piece of land, as long as it doesn’t contain any
    swamps. Also, Per is sure that no square within his parcel is
    owned by somebody else.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line a positive integer: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n, m \leq 1\, 000$</span>): the
        dimensions of Per’s parcel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        with <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> characters.
        Each character is either ‘<tt>#</tt>’ or ‘<tt>.</tt>’. The
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th character on
        the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line is a
        ‘<tt>#</tt>’ if position <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i,
        j)$</span> is a swamp, and ‘<tt>.</tt>’ if it is grass. The
        north-west corner of Per’s parcel has coordinates
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 1)$</span>, and the
        south-east corner has coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(n,m)$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Zero or more lines containing a complete list of how
        many parcels of each perimeter Per needs to sell in order
        to maximize his profit. More specifically, if Per should
        sell <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> parcels of
        perimeter <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> in the
        optimal solution, output a single line “<span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> <tt>x</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>”. The lines should be sorted
        in increasing order of <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. No two lines should have the
        same value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, and
        you should not output lines with <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i=0$</span>.</p>
