<div class="problembody">
<p>It has been a long day at your new job. You have spent all
    day optimizing the most important Suffix-Array data structures
    your new employer, the GCPC ([G]lobal Suffix [C]ollecting and
    [P]rocessing [C]ollective), works with. The moment you were
    just about to shut down your workstation you stop and stare at
    the monitor. Your test run just has revealed that large
    portions of the important data must be corrupted. Sadly, the
    Company’s backup servers just crashed yesterday, and now you
    may have destroyed the valuable Suffix-Arrays.</p>
<p>On inspecting the data, you find that it could hardly be
    worse. A lot of the suffixes are missing and even the ones
    remaining might be broken. You have found examples wherein
    parts of the letters have been replaced by random letters, and
    in some parts you find a single ’<tt class="tt">*</tt>’, the
    placeholder character you used in the software. This
    placeholder has replaced an arbitrarily large substring.
    Furthermore, you found some inconsistent strings, for which it
    is not clear which version of the character is the right one.
    Your only chance now is to hope and pray that a recovery is
    possible.</p>
<p>The data is given as a list of suffixes, together with the
    start-position of the suffix. You also still have a list of the
    length of all the data-sets the company has in stock. Can you
    possibly reconstruct at least the base strings? If so, one
    could run one of those fancy new Suffix-Array algorithms to
    reconstruct the full data-set again.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The number of test cases <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; t \le 100$</span>) is given on a single line at the
    beginning of the input. Every test case is composed as follows.
    First, on a single line, the length <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> of the desired output string is
    given, together with the number of (partially broken) suffixes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq l \leq 10\, 000$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s \leq 10\, 000$</span>). Then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> lines follow, giving
    the position <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p \leq l$</span>) of the
    suffix in the string and the suffix. The suffix will contain
    only characters from the set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ \texttt{a},\ldots
    ,\texttt{z},\texttt{A},\ldots
    ,\texttt{Z},\texttt{.},\texttt{*}\} $</span> (the ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’ has no special meaning). Each suffix
    contains at most one ‘<tt class="ttfamily">*</tt>’. The total
    sum of characters given for the suffixes will not exceed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$500\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Whenever it is possible to reconstruct the lost input data
    print the reconstructed sentence, else print “<tt class="tt">IMPOSSIBLE</tt>” on a single line. For our case, the
    recovery is only possible if the set of possible characters for
    a position in the string contains exactly one character.</p>
