<p>It’s SoCCat’s birthday, and they have baked a delicious cake
    for the occasion. Unfortunately, there are too many students in
    SoC who is attending the party and interested in eating the
    cake. It is not feasible to cut the cake into sectors,
    otherwise the angle of each sector would be too small.</p>
<p>We model the cake on the Cartesian coordinate plane as a
    circle with radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$10000$</span>
    (in some unknown unit) with center <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 0)$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> SoC students are invited to cut
    the cake, and each of them will be making a single straight
    cut. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th student
    will make a cut on the straight line from point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i, y_ i)$</span> to point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x’_ i, y’_ i)$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i, y_ i)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x’_ i, y’_ i)$</span> are distinct points
    lying on the circumference of the circle.</p>
<p>Obviously, the cake will be divided into several pieces by
    the cuts. SoCCat wants to know the number of pieces that the
    cake will be divided into after all the cuts are made, in order
    to call the correct number of students to eat the cake.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 30$</span>), the number of cuts by the
    students.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each
    contain four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_
    i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x’_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y’_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10000 \leq x_ i, y_ i, x’_ i, y’_ i \leq
    10000$</span>), the coordinates of the two endpoints of the cut
    made by the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    student.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that the cuts are distinct, i.e. there are
    no two cuts which entirely overlap.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the number of pieces that the cake
    will be divided into after all the cuts are made.</p>
