</div>A new town is being planned, and the designers have some
    very specific ideas about how things should be laid out. First,
    they lay out the streets. Each street is perfectly straight and
    passes completely from one end of the town to the other. These
    streets divide the town into regions, and each region is to be
    designated either “residential” or “commercial.” The town
    planners require that any two regions directly across the
    street from one another must have different designations. On
    this one particular day, all of the streets have been planned,
    but none of the regions have been designated. One town planner
    wishes to purchase two properties, and it is important to him
    that the properties eventually have different designations. For
    this problem, the streets can be modeled by lines in the plane
    that extend forever in both directions and have no width, and
    properties may be modeled by points. Given the lines and two
    points, can you decide whether or not they must get different
    designations, “commercial” or “residential?”

    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> on a single line, giving the
    number of streets (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le S \le
    10\, 000$</span>). The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> lines of input each contain four
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_2$</span>, specifying the coordinates of
    two distinct points <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1,
    y_1)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2,
    y_2)$</span>. The unique line through these two points gives
    one of the streets. Each coordinate is in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0, 10\, 000]$</span>, and no
    two lines will be identical. That is, the town will have
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> distinct streets. The
    next line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the number of pairs of properties
    to test (<span class="tex2jax_process">$ 1 \le T \le 1\,
    000$</span>). This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines of input, each containing
    four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_3$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_4$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_4$</span>, representing two distinct
    points <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_3, y_3)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_4, y_4)$</span>, where each
    point lies within one of the two properties to test. None of
    these points will lie on any of the streets, nor will both
    points lie within the same property. Again, each coordinate is
    in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0, 10\,
    000]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    pairs of properties to be tested, output either “same” if the
    properties are guaranteed to receive the same designation or
    “different” if they are guaranteed to receive different
    designations.</p>
