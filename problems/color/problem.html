<p>Having discolored his white socks in a rather beige shade
    (as seen on the picture), Luktas Svettocek realised he can’t
    just throw all his laundry into one machine and expect it to
    retain its original colors. However, he is also too lazy to do
    his laundry in several rounds. He would much rather buy more
    laundry machines!</p>
<p>Each of Luktas’ socks have a color <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ i$</span> which has a number between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> assigned to it. After some
    experimentation, he found that he could wash any socks with a
    maximum absolute color difference of <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> in the same machine without any
    discoloring. The color difference of two socks <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$|D_ i - D_ j|$</span>.</p>
<p>Luktas now needs to know how many washing machines he needs
    to wash his <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> socks,
    given that each machine can take at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> socks a time.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line consists of three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le S, C \le 10^5$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le K \le 10^9$</span>, the number of
    socks, the capacity of a laundry machine and the maximum color
    difference, respectively. Then follow one line with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> integers; these are
    the color values <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ i$</span> of
    every sock.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer; the number of machines Luktas needs
    to wash all his socks.</p>
