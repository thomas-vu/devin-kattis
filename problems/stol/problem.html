<p>Mirko has bought an apartment and wants to invite to dinner
    as many people as possible to celebrate with him. For this he
    needs a large rectangular wooden table for which he will sit
    down with his guests. The number of people a table can
    accommodate is equal to its perimeter (the sum of the lengths
    of all four sides). Mirko wants to buy a table such that it
    fits in his apartment and that as many people as possible can
    sit down with him for dinner. The table must be placed so that
    its edges are parallel to the edges of the apartment.</p>
<p>Given the layout of the apartment, find the number of people
    Mirko can invite to dinner.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq R, C \leq 1\, 000$</span>), the dimensions of the
    apartment. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rows contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> characters (without spaces),
    whether a square is free (‘<tt>.</tt>’) or blocked
    (‘<tt>X</tt>’).</p>
<p>Mirko can put his table only in free squares.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of guests Mirko can invite to dinner after
    he buys his table on a single line.</p>
