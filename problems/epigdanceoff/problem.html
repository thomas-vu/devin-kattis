<p>Pubnite is an epic battle royale game featuring unique
    gameplay mechanics such as dancing! Every player enjoys dancing
    in the middle of fierce and brutal tactical firefights.</p>
<p>This unique feature has made Pubnite the second most popular
    game on the internet, next to none but BeeLizard’s first person
    shooter game OvalWatch! Epig Games, the developer of Pubnite,
    is thinking of pulling one last trick to outsell OvalWatch, and
    defeat its competitor, BeeLizard, once and for all.</p>
<p>Announcing Epig Games’ new limited-time global event: Epig
    Dance Off!</p>
<p>In Epig Dance Off, players can invent dance moves, videotape
    themselves dancing and submit their dance moves to Epig Games,
    where Epig Games will rate the moves. At the end of the event,
    Epig Games will announce the moves with the best ratings, and
    incorporate those dance moves into the game. The inventors of
    the moves will be crowned Supreme Winners of Epig Dance Off,
    and there is no greater glory than that.</p>
<p>Epig Games ran into an issue. Too many players are eager to
    join the Epig Dance Off and there are too many submissions to
    rate. The incredibly smart designers at Epig Games came up with
    yet another ingenious idea – they shall use software to
    determine the rating of a dance!</p>
<p>Having not enough engineering power at Epig Games, they have
    hired an intern – you – to write software that rates a
    dance!</p>
<p>The rating system is designed as follows: Each dance is
    composed of a sequence of moves. The rating of the dance is the
    number of moves performed in the sequence.</p>
<p>The dance is described by a grid with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> rows and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> columns. Each character in the
    grid is either a ‘$’, denoting the dancer is seen in this
    position, or a ‘_’, denoting the dancer is not seen in this
    position. When there is a single blank column, that denotes a
    frame is completed and the dancer has completed one move, where
    a blank column is defined to contain only ‘_’.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>. It is guaranteed that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N, M\leq 2\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> characters
    each. It is guaranteed that each character is either ‘_’or ‘$’.
    It is also guaranteed that both the first and last columns are
    non-blank, and no two consecutive columns are both blank.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the rating of the dance, i.e.
    number of dance moves in the recording.</p>
