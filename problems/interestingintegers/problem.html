<p>Undoubtedly you know of the Fibonacci numbers. Starting with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_1 = 1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_2 = 1$</span>, every next number is the
    sum of the two previous ones. This results in the sequence
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1,1,2,3,5,8,13,\ldots
    $</span>.</p>
<p>Now let us consider more generally sequences that obey the
    same recursion relation</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{equation*} G_ i = G_{i-1} + G_{i-2}
    \qquad \text {for } i&gt;2 \end{equation*}</span>
<p>but start with two numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$G_1 \leq G_2$</span> of our own choice. We
    shall call these Gabonacci sequences. For example, if one uses
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$G_1=1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$G_2=3$</span>, one gets what are known as
    the Lucas numbers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1,3,4,7,11,18,29,\ldots $</span>. These
    numbers are – apart from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> – different from the Fibonacci
    numbers.</p>
<p>By choosing the first two numbers appropriately, you can get
    any number you like to appear in the Gabonacci sequence. For
    example, the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    appears in the sequence that starts with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>, but that is a bit lame. It
    would be more fun to start with numbers that are as small as
    possible, would you not agree?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>.
    After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 10^9$</span>): the number
        to appear in the sequence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; a \leq b$</span>), such that, for
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$G_1=a$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$G_2=b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$G_ k = n$</span> for some <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>. These numbers should be the
        smallest possible, i.e., there should be no numbers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$a’$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b’$</span> with the same property, for
        which <span class="tex2jax_process">$b’&lt;b$</span>, or
        for which <span class="tex2jax_process">$b’=b$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$a’&lt;a$</span>.</p>
</li>
