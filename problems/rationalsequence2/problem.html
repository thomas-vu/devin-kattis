<p>A sequence of positive rational numbers is defined as
    follows:</p>
<p>An infinite full binary tree labeled by positive rational
    numbers is defined by:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The label of the root is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/1$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The left child of label <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/(p+q)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right child of label <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$(p+q)/q$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The top of the tree is shown in the following figure:</p>

</div>
<p>The sequence is defined by doing a level order (breadth
    first) traversal of the tree (indicated by the light dashed
    line). So that:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ F(1) = 1/1,
    F(2) = 1/2, F(3) = 2/1, F(4) = 1/3, F(5) = 3/2, F(6) = 2/3,
    \ldots \]</span>
<p>Write a program which finds the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> for which <span class="tex2jax_process">$F(n)$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span> for inputs <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le P \le 1000)$</span>, which is the
    number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be
    processed identically and independently. Each data set consists
    of a single line of input. It contains the data set number,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, a single space, the
    numerator, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, a forward
    slash (<tt class="ttfamily">/</tt>) and the denominator,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>, of the desired
    fraction.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is a single line of output. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single space which
    is then followed by the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> for which <span class="tex2jax_process">$F(n)$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span>. Inputs will be chosen so
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> will fit in a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span>-bit integer.</p>
