<p>Instructor Bob is building an automatic source code
    formatting grading website. The name of the website is
    “MrCodeFormatGrader”. When you run Bob’s program and submit
    your source code to it, the program will output <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, the number of lines of source
    code; <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of
    source code lines that have format errors; and a list of line
    numbers that are not properly formatted. The line numbers are
    separated by spaces and in increasing order.</p>
<p>So for a <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>-line
    program, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> errors
    occurring on lines <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$88$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$89$</span>, the original program might
    output this:</p>
<pre>
     100 10
     2 3 5 10 11 12 25 26 88 89
</pre>
<p>However, the people that used this program said that this
    output is not very readable. Your job is to read the output
    above and show two lists: a compressed list of errors and
    another compressed list of correct lines.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of two lines. The first line contains two
    integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, the number
    of lines of source code in the program being checked, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq C \leq 100\, 000$</span>;
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of
    source code lines containing format errors, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq \min (C-1, 1\, 000)$</span>.
    The second line of input will contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> values, identifying the line
    numbers of source code lines with format errors. These values
    are positive integers less than or equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> and are listed in strictly
    increasing order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output consists of two lines. The first line should start
    with the string: “<tt class="ttfamily">Errors:</tt>”, followed
    by a space, followed by a list of lines with errors. The second
    line of output should start with the string: “<tt class="ttfamily">Correct:</tt>”, followed by a space, followed by a
    list of lines without errors. For both lists, a contiguous set
    of line numbers should be represented by listing the first and
    last line, separated by a hyphen (‘-’). In lists with two or
    more items, items should be separated by a comma and space
    except for the last value (or last range of contiguous values)
    of each list, which should be separated with an “and” instead
    of a comma and space. See the sample output. Note: every
    program will have at least one error and at least 1 correct
    line.</p>
