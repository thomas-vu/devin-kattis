<p>In the heart of your home city, there is an old square,
    close to the train station, appropriately called <em>Station
    Square</em>. It used to look like a perfect square: four sides
    of equal length joined by right angles. However, it hasnâ€™t
    looked like this for decades, as one of the four corners was
    destroyed by bombings in the Second World War. After the war,
    the square was rebuilt as a quarter circle, and it has looked
    like that ever since. (In other words, it looks like an
    isosceles right triangle, except that the hypothenuse is not a
    straight line but a circular arc.) This is illustrated in the
    figure below, which corresponds with Sample Input 1.</p>

<p>Recently, the city council voted to completely remodel the
    train station and its surroundings, which includes restoring
    Station Square to its original state. Therefore they need to
    determine the exact location of the fourth corner. This task is
    too complicated for ordinary aldermen, so the city decided to
    hire a top scientist. That would be you! Please help the city
    complete the square, and you will be greatly rewarded!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There are three lines of input. Each line contains two
    integers denoting the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates of one
    of the corners of the current square (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^4 \leq x,y\leq 10^4$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with two space-separated integers denoting
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates of the long-lost
    fourth corner.</p>
