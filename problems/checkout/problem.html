<p>You recently started playing darts and want to learn the
    “<span class="tex2jax_process">$501$</span>” variant.</p>
<p>Players take turns throwing three darts; the aim is to
    reduce your score from <span class="tex2jax_process">$501$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. The darts board contains of
    slices numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>, with the obvious
    scoring rule: when your dart hits <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span> (called “single <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span>” in darts lingo), your score is
    reduced by <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span>. Each of
    the twenty slices contains smaller areas called “double” and
    “triple”; hitting “double <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>” reduces your score by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\cdot 6 = 12$</span>, hitting
    ”triple <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>” reduces it by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\cdot 4 = 12$</span>”. In the
    middle of the darts board, ”single bull” is worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> points, “bullseye” is worth
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>.</p>
<p>In the <span class="tex2jax_process">$501$</span> variant,
    your final throw—called the <em>checkout</em>—must reduce your
    score to <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> using a
    double or bullseye. (Not a triple, and not single bull.)</p>
<p>It is difficult to calculate the scores in the heat of the
    game—instead you write a problem to help you.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The only line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq T \leq 501$</span>, your current
    score.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is not possible to reduce your score to <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> with at most three throws, print
    “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”. Otherwise, output
    between one and three lines. Each line contains a dart throw,
    either of the form “<tt class="ttfamily">single bull</tt>” or
    “<tt class="ttfamily">bullseye</tt>”, or of the form
    “<tt class="ttfamily">single</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>”, “<tt class="ttfamily">double</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>”, or “<tt class="ttfamily">triple</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>”, for integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$s\in \{ 1,\ldots , 20\} $</span>. The total
    points of all throws must equal <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> and the last throw must be either
    “<tt class="ttfamily">bullseye</tt>” or a “<tt class="ttfamily">double</tt>”. If there are multiple valid answers,
    output any of them.</p>
