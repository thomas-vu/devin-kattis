<p>Puff the Magic Dinosaur is a renowned magician. Due to the
    pandemic, he can only perform for his princess using the latest
    video conferencing tools. As a result, many of his usual
    in-person routines cannot be performed, and he must come up
    with a new trick.</p>
<p>Puff has decided to perform the following mentalist trick
    for the princess. First, Puff lays out <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> cards on the table. Each of these
    cards have a unique label <span class="tex2jax_process">$1,
    \ldots , N$</span>. Before the start of the show, Puff wrote
    down a prediction which is the label of one of the cards, put
    it into a sealed envelope, and mailed it to the princess.</p>
<p>During the show, Puff asks the princess to choose some of
    the remaining cards. Puff is careful to remind the princess to
    choose at least one but not all of the remaining cards. After
    the princess tells Puff which cards she chose, Puff would then
    say either “you chose to keep those cards” or “you chose to
    remove those cards”. In the first case, the chosen cards are
    kept and all other cards are removed from the table. In the
    second case, the chosen cards are removed and the remaining
    cards are kept. This is repeated until there is only one card
    left. At this point Puff asks the princess to open the
    envelope, and magically the prediction matches the remaining
    card on the table.</p>
<p>Help Puff determine the appropriate response at each
    step.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 200$</span>), which is the number of cards,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq P \leq N$</span>), which is the
    secret prediction, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq S \leq N-1$</span>),
    which is the number of steps.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> lines
    describe the choices of the princess at each step. Each of
    these lines starts with the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq m \leq N-1$</span>), which is the number of cards chosen,
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> distinct
    integers indicating the labels of the cards chosen. It is
    guaranteed that if Puff has carried out the previous steps
    correctly, the princess will only choose cards still on the
    table. Furthermore, the princess will always choose at least
    one but not all of the remaining cards.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that there will be one card left after
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> steps if Puff has
    carried out all <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> steps
    correctly.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each step, display on a line either <tt class="ttfamily">KEEP</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">REMOVE</tt> if
    Puff should keep the chosen cards or remove the chosen cards,
    respectively.</p>
