<div class="problembody">
<p>Anthony and Cora are playing Dominion, their favorite card
    game. In Dominion, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> different card types, and each
    player has a set of cards (known as a deck). A deck
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> is said to have
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> combos if <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> is the largest integer such that
    for <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> different card
    types in the game, <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>
    contains at least two cards of that type. Anthony currently has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> cards and he wants to
    trade cards with Cora such that he’ll have a deck with exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> combos.</p>
<p>For each card type <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq i\leq T$</span>), Anthony
    can choose to perform at most one transaction. There are two
    types of transaction:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Buy up to two cards of <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> type from Cora at
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> coins each</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sell all his cards of <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> type for <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> coins each</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Anthony wants to maximize his profit while obtaining a
    complete deck. Anthony is willing to spend coins in order to
    obtain a complete deck if necessary, but of course he wants to
    minimize his spending in that case. Note that he doesn’t care
    about keeping the rest of his cards which don’t contribute to
    the complete deck.</p>
<p>Anthony has hired you to help him calculate how much money
    he can make if he chooses the optimal strategy for obtaining
    enough combos. If he has to spend money, output a negative
    number.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq K\leq T\leq 100\, 000$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N\leq 2T$</span>.</p>
<p>The next line is a list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers representing the cards in
    Anthony’s deck. Each integer on this line is between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> inclusive. It is guaranteed no
    integers appear more than twice.</p>
<p>Finally, each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines of the input contains two
    integers each. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\mathrm
    {th}$</span> line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq a_ i, b_ i\leq
    10^9$</span>, corresponding to the price of buying and selling
    a card of type <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer denoting Anthony’s profit assuming
    he trades optimally.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample Input</h2>
<p>In the first example, Anthony should sell two of card
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and buy one of card
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and one of card
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> for a net profit of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> coins. If he chooses
    to sell one of card <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>
    and buy one of card <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>,
    then he’ll end up spending <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> coins.</p>
