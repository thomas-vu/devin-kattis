<div class="problembody">
<p>Last night, Tom went on a date with a really nice girl.
    However, he forgot to take his credit card with him and he had
    no cash in his wallet, so he ended up working at the restaurant
    to pay for the bill. His task is to take plates from the waiter
    when he comes from the tables, and pass them along when the
    diswasher requests them. It is very important for the plates to
    be washed in the same order as they are brought from the
    tables, as otherwise it could take too long before a plate is
    washed, and leftover food might get stuck. Trying to hold all
    the plates in his hands is probably not a great idea, so Tom
    puts them on a table as soon as the waiter hands them over to
    him, and picks them up from the table again when the time comes
    to pass them along to the dishwasher. There is space for only
    two piles of plates on the table, which will be referred to as
    pile 1 and pile 2. There is only one table Tom can use.</p>
<p>Tom won last year’s SWERC, so he is certainly capable of
    optimizing for efficiency. You have to output a transcript of
    one possible way in which Tom might decide to organize the
    plates on the table during the process, given the sequence of
    plates and requests he receives.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input has several test cases, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>. Each case begins with a line
    containing a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 1\, 000$</span>),
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines,
    which contain either <tt class="ttfamily">DROP m</tt> or
    <tt class="ttfamily">TAKE m</tt>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$m &gt; 0$</span> is the number of plates to
    take or drop. <tt class="ttfamily">DROP m</tt> represents that
    the next event is the waiter bringing <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> plates to Tom, so he has to drop
    them on the table, while <tt class="ttfamily">TAKE m</tt>
    represents that the next event is Tom taking <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> plates from the table and passing
    them along in the right order. You can assume that he never
    receives a <tt class="ttfamily">TAKE m</tt> instruction when
    there are fewer than <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    plates on the table, and that the sum <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> of all values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> corresponding to <tt class="ttfamily">DROP</tt> operations does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>. Note that there might be
    plates left on Tom’s table when the last request is issued, as
    Tom might be relieved of his duty to stay until the restaurant
    closes.</p>
<p>The input ends with a line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N = 0$</span>, which must not be
    processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For every test case, the output will be a series of lines
    describing the operations to be performed with the plates. The
    content of each line will be one of the following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">DROP 1 m</tt> (<tt class="ttfamily">DROP 2 m</tt>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$m
        &gt; 0$</span>, if Tom needs to take a plate from the
        waiter, drop it on top of pile 1 (pile 2), and repeat this
        operation <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> times in
        total.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">TAKE 1 m</tt> (<tt class="ttfamily">TAKE 2 m</tt>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$m
        &gt; 0$</span>, if Tom needs to take a plate from the top
        of pile 1 (pile 2), pass it along to the dishwasher, and
        repeat <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> times in
        total.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">MOVE 1-&gt;2 m</tt> (<tt class="ttfamily">MOVE 2-&gt;1 m</tt>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$m &gt; 0$</span>, if Tom needs to take a
        plate from the top of pile 1 (pile 2), drop it on top of
        pile 2 (pile 1), and repeat <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> times in total.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You must output at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$6N$</span> lines, and the total number of
    movements of plates in your transcript (that is, the sum of the
    m’s printed in your output, for all three kinds of operations),
    must be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$6M$</span>, as
    otherwise Tom won’t be able to cope with all the work.</p>
<p>Note that Tom must obey the commands in the same order as
    they are issued. This means that, if he receives a <tt class="ttfamily">TAKE m</tt> command, he must perform a certain
    number of <tt class="ttfamily">MOVE</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">TAKE</tt> operations such that the sum of the
    numbers of plates <em>taken</em> adds up exactly to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> before performing the
    operations corresponding to the next command; and if he
    receives a <tt class="ttfamily">DROP m</tt> command, he must
    perform a number of <tt class="ttfamily">DROP</tt> or
    <tt class="ttfamily">MOVE</tt> operations for which the sum of
    the numbers of plates dropped adds up exactly to <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> before performing the operations
    corresponding to the next command.</p>
<p>Of course, it is also forbidden to take plates from the
    waiter or pass them along to the dishwasher in the absence of a
    corresponding order.</p>
<p>There <em>must</em> be an empty line between the outputs of
    different cases.</p>
<p>Any solution satisfying these conditions will be
    accepted.</p>
