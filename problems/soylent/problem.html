<div class="problembody">
<p>Yraglac recently decided to try out Soylent, a meal
    replacement drink designed to meet all nutritional requirements
    for an average adult. Soylent not only tastes great but is also
    low-cost, which is important for Yraglac as he is currently on
    a budget. Each bottle provides <span class="tex2jax_process">$400$</span> calories, so it is recommended
    that an individual should consume <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> bottles a day for <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000$</span> total calories. However,
    Yraglac is wondering how many bottles he should consume if his
    daily calorie requirement is not the same as an average adult.
    He can only consume an integer number of bottles, and needs to
    consume at least his daily calorie requirement.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 1\, 000$</span> giving the number of
    test cases. Each test case consists of a single line with an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq N \leq 10\, 000$</span>), the number
    of calories Yraglac needs in a day.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the
    number of bottles Yraglac needs to consume for the day.</p>
