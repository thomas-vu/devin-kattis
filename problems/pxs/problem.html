<div class="problembody">
<p>Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> be any positive
    integer. A <em>factor</em> of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is any number that divides evenly
    into <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, without leaving
    a remainder. For example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span> is a factor of <span class="tex2jax_process">$52$</span>, since <span class="tex2jax_process">$52/13 = 4$</span>. A <em>subsequence</em> of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is a number without a
    leading zero that can be obtained from <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> by discarding one or more of its
    digits. For example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$801$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$882$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1324$</span> are all subsequences of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8013824$</span>, but
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$214$</span> is not (you can’t
    rearrange digits), <span class="tex2jax_process">$8334$</span>
    is not (you can’t have more occurrences of a digit than appear
    in the original number), <span class="tex2jax_process">$8013824$</span> is not (you must discard at
    least one digit), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$01$</span>
    is not (you can’t have a leading zero). A <em>subfactor</em> of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is an integer greater
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> that is both a
    factor and a subsequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$8013824$</span> has subfactors <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>. Some numbers do not have a
    subfactor; for example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$6341$</span> is not divisible by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$63$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$64$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$61$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$34$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$41$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$634$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$631$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$641$</span>, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$341$</span>.</p>
<p>An x-subfactor series of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is a decreasing series of integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_1, \ldots , n_ k$</span>, in
    which (1) <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = n_1$</span>, (2)
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k \ge 1$</span>, (3) for all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i &lt; k$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_{i+1}$</span> is obtained from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ i$</span> by first discarding
    the digits of a subfactor of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_
    i$</span>, and then discarding leading zeros, if any, and (4)
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ k$</span> has no subfactor.
    The term “x-subfactor” is meant to suggest that a subfactor
    gets x’ed, or discarded, as you go from one number to the next.
    For example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2004$</span> has
    two distinct x-subfactor series, the second of which can be
    obtained in two distinct ways. The highlighted digits show the
    subfactor that was removed to produce the next number in the
    series.</p>
<p><b class="bfseries"><u><u>2</u></u></b>004 4<br/>
    200<b class="bfseries"><u><u>4</u></u></b> <b class="bfseries"><u><u>20</u></u></b>0 0<br/>
    200<b class="bfseries"><u><u>4</u></u></b> <b class="bfseries"><u><u>2</u></u></b>00 0<br/></p>
<p>The <em>primary</em> x-subfactor series has maximal length
    (the largest <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> possible,
    using the notation above). If there are two or more
    maximal-length series, then the one with the smallest second
    number is primary; if all maximal-length series have the same
    first and second numbers, then the one with the smallest third
    number is primary; and so on. Every positive integer has a
    unique primary x-subfactor series, although it may be possible
    to obtain it in more than one way, as is the case with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2004$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> positive integers, each less than
    one billion, without leading zeroes, and on a line by itself.
    Following is a line containing only “0” that signals the end of
    the input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each positive integer, output its primary x-subfactor
    series using the exact format shown in the examples below.</p>
