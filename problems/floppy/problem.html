<p>Your friend’s newest hobby is to play movie theme songs on
    her freshly acquired floppy drive organ. This organ is a
    collection of good old floppy drives, where each drive has been
    tampered with to produce sound of a unique frequency. The sound
    is produced by a step motor that moves the read/write head of
    the floppy drive along the radial axis of the drive’s spin
    disk. The radial axis starts in the center of the spin disk and
    ends at the outer edge of the spin disk.</p>
<p>The sound from one drive will play continuously as long as
    the read/write head keeps moving in one direction; when the
    head changes direction, there is a brief pause of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>fs—one floppysecond, or about
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> microseconds. The
    read/write head must change direction when it reaches either
    the inner or the outer end point of the radial axis, but it can
    also change direction at any other point along this axis, as
    determined by your friend. You can make the head stay still at
    any time and for as long as you wish. The starting position of
    the read-write head can be chosen freely.</p>
<p>Your friend is a nutcase perfectionist, and will not accept
    any pauses where there are not supposed to be any; nor will she
    accept sound when there is meant to be silence. To figure out
    whether a given piece of music can be played—perfectly—on her
    organ, she has asked for your help.</p>
<p>For each frequency, you are given a list of intervals, each
    describing when that particular frequency should play, and you
    must decide if all of the frequencies can be played as
    intended. You can assume your friend has enough drives to cover
    all the required frequencies.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$f, 1 \leq f \leq 10$</span>, denoting the
    number of frequencies used. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> blocks, on the format:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>A single line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i, 1\leq t_ i \leq 10\ 000$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ i, 1\leq n_ i \leq
        100$</span>; the number of floppyseconds it takes for the
        read/write head of frequency <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to move between the end points
        of its radial axis, and the number of intervals for which
        frequency <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
        should play.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ i$</span> lines, where
        the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th line
        has two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_{i,2j}, t_{i,2j+1}$</span>, where
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq t_{i,2j},t_{i,2j+1}
        \leq 1\ 000\ 000$</span>, indicating that
        the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
        frequency should start playing at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_{i,2j}$</span> and stop playing at
        time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_{i,2j+1}$</span>. You
        can assume that these numbers are in stricly ascending
        order, i.e. <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_{i,1} &lt;
        t_{i,2} &lt; \dots &lt; t_{i, 2n_ i}$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is possible to play all the <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> frequencies as intended, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">possible</tt>”. Otherwise output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”.</p>
