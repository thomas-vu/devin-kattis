<p><em>Note that this is an easier version of the problem
    crophard.</em></p>
<p>Some pranksters have watched too much Discovery Channel and
    now they want to build a crop triangle during the night. They
    want to build it inside a large crop that looks like an evenly
    spaced grid from above. There are some trees planted on the
    field. Each tree is situated on an intersection of two grid
    lines (a grid point). The pranksters want the vertices of their
    crop triangle to be located at these trees. Also, for their
    crop triangle to be more interesting they want the
    <em>center</em> of that triangle to be located at some grid
    point as well. We remind you that if a triangle has the
    vertices <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1), (x_2,
    y_2)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_3,
    y_3)$</span>, then the center for this triangle will have the
    coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$((x_1 + x_2 + x_3) /
    3, (y_1 + y_2 + y_3) / 3)$</span>.</p>
<p>You will be given a set of points with integer coordinates
    giving the location of all the trees on the grid. You are asked
    to compute how many triangles you can form with
    <em>distinct</em> vertices in this set of points so that their
    center is a grid point as well (i.e. the center has integer
    coordinates).</p>
<p>If a triangle has area 0 we will still consider it a valid
    triangle.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input gives the number of cases,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>.</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases follow.
    Each test case consists of one line containing the integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n, A, B, C, D, x_0, y_0$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> separated by
    exactly one space. <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    will be the number of trees in the input set.</p>
<p>Using the numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n, A, B, C,
    D, x_0, y_0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> the following pseudocode will
    print the coordinates of the trees in the input set.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\bmod $</span> indicates the
    remainder operation. The parameters will be chosen such that
    the input set of trees will not have duplicates.</p>
<pre>
X = x0, Y = y0
print X, Y
for i = 1 to n-1
    X = (A * X + B) mod M
    Y = (C * Y + D) mod M
    print X, Y
</pre>
<p>You can assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq
    T\leq 10; 0\leq A, B, C, D, x_0, y_0 \leq 10^9; 1\leq M\leq
    10^9$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\leq n\leq
    100$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing "Case
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>: " where <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is the test case number (starting
    from 1). This should be followed by an integer indicating the
    number of triangles which can be located at 3 distinct trees
    and has a center that is a grid point.</p>
