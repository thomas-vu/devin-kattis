<div class="problembody">
<p>From a pile of suggested tasks, authors of COCI must choose
    ones that will appear in the next round.</p>
<p>Difficulty of a task is described with an integer in range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. For some tasks, however, it is
    not easy to exactly determine their difficulty. The COCI
    authors decided that these tasks can be considered as having
    either one of two consecutive difficulties. For example, some
    task can be considered as having difficulty of either
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>.</p>
<p>The next round of COCI will contain exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> tasks. For each difficulty, there
    will be exactly one task with that difficulty. Of course, no
    task will appear twice.</p>
<p>Find the number of different ways authors can choose tasks
    for the next round. We say that two ways are different if for
    some difficulty, a different task is assigned to that
    difficulty.</p>
<p>Since the expected result can be very large, output the
    number of ways modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\,
    000\, 007$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 100\, 000$</span>).</p>
<p>The second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers not greater than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th number in this line is equal to
    the number of available tasks having difficulty exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
<p>The third line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> integers not greater than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th number in this line is equal to
    the number of available tasks having difficulty either
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the required
    number of ways modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\,
    000\, 007$</span>.</p>
