<p>Lukáš really likes orienteering, a sport that requires
    locating control points in rough terrain. To entertain the
    NWERC participants Lukáš wants to organize an orienteering
    race. However, it would be too harsh for the participants to be
    outdoors in this cold Swedish November weather, so he decided
    to jump on the new trend of indoor races, and set the race
    inside the B building of Linköping University.</p>
<p>Lukáš has already decided on the locations of the control
    points. He has also decided on the exact length of the race, so
    the only thing remaining is to decide in which order the
    control points should be visited such that the length of the
    total race is as he wishes. Because this is not always
    possible, he asks you to write a program to help him.</p>
<p><em>Note from the organizer: the NWERC indoorienteering race
    for this year has been cancelled since we neglected to apply
    for an orienteering permit in time from the university
    administration. (We still need you to solve the problem so that
    we can organize it for next year.)</em></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq n \leq 14$</span>) and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq L \leq 10^{15}$</span>), the
        number of control points and the desired length of the
        race, respectively;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines with
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers each. The
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>th integer on the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th line,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_{ij}$</span>, denotes the
        distance between control point <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq d_{ij} \leq L$</span> for
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i \not= j$</span>, and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_{ii} = 0$</span>). For all
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i,j,k \leq N$</span>
        it is the case that <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_{ij} =
        d_{ji}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_{ij}
        \leq d_{ik} + d_{kj}$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with “<tt class="ttfamily">possible</tt>” if
    it is possible to visit all control points once in some order
    and directly return to the first one such that the total
    distance is exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>, and “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>” otherwise.</p>
