<p>The following figure contains a lot of triangles,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$88$</span> in fact. Two of them
    are highlighted. The figure is made up of 15 line segments. You
    have a triangle if you can start at an intersection of line
    segments <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> until it intersects with some line
    segment <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> and then
    follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> until it
    intersects with <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>.</p>

<p>Counting triangles by hand can be a bit tedious, so you
    decide to write a simple program to help out.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$250$</span> test cases. Each test case
    starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n
    \le 50$</span>. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each containing four
    space-separated real values, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1~ y_1~ x_2~ y_2$</span> which defines a
    line segment from from point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1,y_1)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2,y_2)$</span>. Within a test case, line
    segments may be parallel, but two segments never intersect at
    more than a single point. Also, no more than two line segments
    intersect at a single point. All real values are in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0,100]$</span> and have at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> digits after the
    decimal point. The end of all test cases is marked with a value
    of zero for <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the number of triangles defined
    by the given line segments.</p>
