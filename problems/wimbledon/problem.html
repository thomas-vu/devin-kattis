<div class="problembody">
<p>A tennis match involves three people: two players and an
    umpire. Each of these has to come from a different country.
    There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> countries,
    and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th country has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> tennis players and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> umpires. (Nobody
    can be both a player and an umpire.) How many different tennis
    matches are possible? Two tennis matches are different if the
    sets of involved people are different.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq N \leq 10^5$</span>. The following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each contain two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a_ i, b_ i \leq 10^6$</span>. You can
    assume <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sum _{i=1}^ N a_ i \leq
    10^6$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sum _{i=1}^ N
    b_ i \leq 10^6$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single integer, the number of possible different tennis
    matches.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample 1</h2>
<p>Assume the players from the first country are called
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_2$</span>, the players from the second
    country are called <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_2$</span>, and the umpire
    from the third country is called <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>. Then there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> matches where <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> is the umpire: <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ A_1, B_1, C\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ A_1, B_2, C\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ A_2, B_1, C\} $</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ A_2, B_2, C\} $</span>. Similarly, there
    are <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> matches with the
    other umpires. In total, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> possible different matches.</p>
