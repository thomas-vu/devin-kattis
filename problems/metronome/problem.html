<p>A <em>Metronome</em> is a mechanical device used by
    musicians for keeping time. It is a very clever device, based
    on a spring, an inverted pendulum, and an escapement gear. Milo
    is learning to play the glockenspiel, and has purchased a
    metronome to help him keep time. Milo has noticed that for
    every complete turn (one revolution) of the key, the metronome
    will give four ticks. Milo wants the metronome to stop at the
    end of each song that he tries to play.</p>
<p>For a given song, how many revolutions must he wind the
    key?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The single line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 10^5$</span>), which is the
    length of the song in ticks.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single real number, which is the number of
    revolutions Milo must turn the metronomeâ€™s key so that it stops
    precisely at the end of the song. This number must be accurate
    to two decimal places.</p>
