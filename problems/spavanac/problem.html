<p>Every school morning Mirko is woken up by the sound of his
    alarm clock. Since he is a bit forgetful, quite often he leaves
    the alarm on on Saturday morning too. That’s not too bad
    though, since he feels good when he realizes he doesn’t have to
    get up from his warm and cozy bed.</p>
<p>He likes that so much that he would like to experience that
    on other days of the week too! His friend Slavko offered this
    simple solution: set his alarm clock <span class="tex2jax_process">$45$</span> minutes early, and he can enjoy
    the comfort of his bed, fully awake, for <span class="tex2jax_process">$45$</span> minutes each day.</p>
<p>Mirko decided to heed his advice, however his alarm clock
    uses <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>-hour notation
    and he has issues with adjusting the time. Help Mirko and write
    a program that will take one time stamp, in <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>-hour notation, and print out a
    new time stamp, <span class="tex2jax_process">$45$</span>
    minutes earlier, also in <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>-hour notation.</p>
<p>If you are unfamiliar with <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>-hour time notation yourself, you
    might be interested to know it starts with 0:00 (midnight) and
    ends with 23:59 (one minute before midnight).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input will contain exactly two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0 \leq H \leq 23, 0 \leq M \leq 59)$</span>
    separated by a single space, the input time in <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>-hour notation. <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> denotes hours and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> minutes.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output should contain exactly two
    integers, the time <span class="tex2jax_process">$45$</span>
    minutes before input time.</p>
