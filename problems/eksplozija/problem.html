<div class="problembody">
<p>Mirko likes to play with strings of characters, but this
    time he has taken it too far – he put an “explosion” in the
    string! An explosion is a series of characters which, if found
    in the vicinity of fire, explodes and starts a chain
    reaction.</p>
<p>Mirko, being as negligent as he usually is, forgot that his
    string contained an explosion and placed it near a candlelight.
    Thus the chain reaction began.</p>
<p>The chain reaction takes place in the following way:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>if a string contains explosions, they all explode and a
        new string is formed by concatenating the pieces without
        the exploding parts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>this concatenation could possibly create new
        explosions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the chain reaction repeats while there are explosions in
        the string</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now Mirko wants to know whether anything will be left after
    this series of chain reactions. If nothing remains, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">FRULA</tt>” (without quotes). If, by any
    chance, something is left, output the final string remaining
    after all the reactions.</p>
<p>Please note: The explosion will not contain two equal
    characters.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains Mirko’s string,
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq |\text {Mirko’s string}|
    \leq 1\ 000\ 000$</span>).</p>
<p>The second line of input contains the explosion string,
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq |\text {explosion}| \leq
    36$</span>).</p>
<p>Both Mirko’s string and the explosion string consist of
    uppercase and lowercase letters of the English alphabet and
    digits <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt>, …, <tt class="ttfamily">9</tt>. The
    characters in the explosion string are all different.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the final
    string remaining after all the reactions as stated in the
    task.</p>
<p>Clarification of the second example: Firstly, the bombs on
    positions <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> explode. Then we are
    left with <tt class="ttfamily">****1****2ab</tt> (where
    <tt class="ttfamily">*</tt> marks the character that exploded)
    and when that string is put together, we get <tt class="ttfamily">12ab</tt>. Sadly, that is an explosion all over
    again so it disappears.</p>
