<p>Bryan is a passenger on a voyage to a distant planet. Like
    the other passengers he awaits in cryosleep. However, due to a
    malfunction he awoke early and finds himself awake and alone.
    The ship’s sophisticated navigation AI, ChatHAL, is responsible
    for waking passengers.</p>
<p>It appears that ChatHAL wants to play a game with Bryan. The
    game is simple: ChatHAL has hidden the key to his cryopod
    beneath one of the other pods. It is Bryan’s job to guess and
    find that pod and retrieve the key to go back to cryosleep.</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cryopods
    on the ship, all lined up in a single file. ChatHAL tells Bryan
    he is able to make up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> guesses per turn. He can guess the
    same pod multiple times if he wants to. Bryan plays his first
    turn of the game, and guesses up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> pods. If the key is underneath one
    of the pods Bryan guessed, then he wins. Otherwise, ChatHAL
    will tell Bryan which two pods enclose the smallest region
    containing the key. The endpoints of this region must each be
    either a pod that Bryan guessed, or the first or last pod in
    the line. Bryan then proceeds on to his second turn, where he
    makes up to another <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>
    guesses once again. This process repeats until Bryan finds the
    key.</p>
<p>There is a slight problem however: <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> can be as large as <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{63}-1$</span>, so Bryan is looking to be
    efficient to avoid searching the entire ship. What is the most
    amount of turns, in the worst case, that Bryan would have to
    play if he played optimally?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of the space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n &lt; 2^{63}$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq b \leq 15$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Return the maximum amount of attempts Bryan would need if he
    guessed optimally.</p>
