<p>A group of scouts are preparing to go to a large meeting
    with other scouts. Their leader Hildeborg, in spirit of the
    scout motto “be prepared”, wants to distribute some useful
    items among the scouts that they most probably will need on
    their adventure. The items come in different sizes, so to make
    this as fair as possible, she wants to make sure that the total
    size of items carried by any scout is as small as possible.
    Furthermore, Hildeborg does not want to give more than two
    items to any scout as she is afraid that it otherwise will be
    too hard for them to remember to bring everything. Given the
    sizes of the items, what is the least maximum total size,
    computed as the sum of items, any scout will have to carry?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 2M$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M
    \leq 100$</span>). <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is
    the number of useful items, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> is the number of scouts. The
    second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a_ i\leq 10^7$</span>)
    giving the sizes of the items.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print one integer, the smallest total size that any scout
    has to carry.</p>
