<p>Boris works at a secret communication station for the
    government training new employees on how to encode messages.
    Messages at this station are encoded with a rotation (“Caesar”)
    cipher that replaces each letter with one at a set offset in
    the alphabet, e.g., for offset <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> an ‘<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>’
    is replaced by a ‘<tt class="ttfamily">c</tt>’ and ‘<tt class="ttfamily">y</tt>’ is replaced by ‘<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>’. In order to encode a message, this cipher
    may be applied more than once. Each such application counts as
    a step in the encoding process. Boris teaches the new employees
    to encode messages by demonstrating each step of the encoding
    individually. However, Boris does not does not like seeing
    messages that contain at least half as many vowels as
    consonants after applying an encoding step. (Boris considers
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>’, ‘<tt class="ttfamily">e</tt>’,
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">i</tt>’, ‘<tt class="ttfamily">o</tt>’,
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">u</tt>’, and ‘<tt class="ttfamily">y</tt>’ as vowels.) He grows annoyed and more and
    more unhappy with each step where this situation occurs.</p>
<p>Your job is to encode a given message and determine whether
    Boris will see fewer steps that annoy him than ones that don’t.
    Since Boris wants to be happy in his job he will give a message
    that annoys him too much to a colleague.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$O$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le O \le 25$</span>) that represent the
    offset used for the rotation cipher. The second line contains
    the message to encode, which consists entirely of lowercase
    English characters. The length of the message is between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$80$</span> characters. The third line
    contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 26$</span>), the
    number of times the cipher must be applied.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output ‘<tt class="ttfamily">Boris</tt>’ if strictly more
    steps sound good than bad, and ‘<tt class="ttfamily">Colleague</tt>’ otherwise.</p>
