<div class="problembody">
<p>Programming languages such as C++ and Java can prefix
    characters to denote the base of constant integer values. For
    example, hexadecimal (base <span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span>) constants are preceded by the
    string “<tt class="ttfamily">0x</tt>”. Octal (base <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>) values are preceded by the
    character “<tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>” (zero). Decimal (base
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>) values do not have a
    prefix. For example, all the following represent the same
    integer constant, albeit in different bases.</p>
<center>
<pre>
0x1234
011064
 4660
</pre>
</center>
<p>The prefix makes it clear to the compiler what base the
    value is in. Without the “<tt class="ttfamily">0x</tt>” prefix,
    for example, it would be impossible for the compiler to
    determine if 1234 was hexadecimal. It could be octal or
    decimal.</p>
<p>For this problem, you will write a program that interprets a
    string of decimal digits as if it were an octal value, a
    decimal value or a hexadecimal value.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single decimal integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 100$</span>), which is the
    number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be
    processed identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single space,
    followed by a string of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> decimal digits.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is one line of output. The single
    output line consists of the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a space followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> space separated
    decimal integers which are the value of the input as if it were
    interpreted to as octal, decimal and hexadecimal respectively.
    If the input value cannot be interpreted as an octal value, use
    the value <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
