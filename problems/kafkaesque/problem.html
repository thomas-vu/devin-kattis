<p>Getting a business permit in Kafkatown requires a trip to
    City Hall. There you are given a permit form that must be
    signed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> city clerks
    whose names are printed at the bottom of the form.</p>
<p>Entering the clerks’ room, you find a long line of people
    working their way down a narrow aisle along the clerks’ desks.
    Their desks are arranged in increasing numeric order. The aisle
    is so narrow that the line is forced to shuffle forward, single
    file, past each of the clerks’ desk in turn. Once in the line
    you cannot leave, back up, or change positions with other
    people.</p>
<p>As you present your permit for a signature, you are told
    that no clerk will sign unless all of the signatures above his
    or her name on the permit form have already been filled in. To
    your dismay, the clerks’ desks are not arranged in the same
    order as the names on your form.</p>
<p>How many times do you need to pass through the line until
    you can get your permit?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, the number of signatures you need
    to collect (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq K \leq
    100$</span>).</p>
<p>This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    lines of input, each containing an integer in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\ldots 100$</span>, indicating
    the desk numbers of each of the clerks whose signature you
    need, in the order that they appear on your form. (Clerks whose
    signatures are not needed on your form are omitted from this
    list.)</p>
<p>For example, the input</p>
<pre>
    5
    1
    23
    18
    13
    99
</pre>
<p>means that you need <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>
    signatures. The first must come from the clerk in desk
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, the next from the
    clerk in desk #<span class="tex2jax_process">$23$</span>, and
    so on, with the final signature coming from the clerk in desk
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$99$</span>.</p>
<p>No desk number appears more than once in the input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single line containing an integer denoting the
    number of passes you need to make through the line until you
    can collect the signatures that you need.</p>
