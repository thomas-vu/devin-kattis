<p>After rescuing Prince Mario, Peach finds herself trapped in
    a polygonal world consisting of many castles. She knows that
    even though she defeated Bowser, Bowser’s unknown cousin Powder
    is coming after her. Peach runs from castle <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to castle <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> as fast as she can, and as she
    reaches castle <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, Powder
    realizes the captives are gone and comes out of castle
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to look for them. Each
    hour, they (Peach and Powder) travel from one castle to an
    adjacent castle through either a dirt path on the edge of the
    world or a bridge directly across the world (the bridges don’t
    intersect with each other though). Unfortunately, Peach can
    only move randomly because she does not know Powder’s location.
    Powder, on the other hand, controls the local satellite network
    and knows Peach’s location at all times. If Powder manages to
    arrive at the same castle as Peach at the same time, he can
    catch Peach. However, since Powder always sleeps in his car, he
    cannot catch Peach when they cross each other en route.</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> castles
    in this polygonal world, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is even. Determine whether Peach
    will be guaranteed to be safe forever.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$4 \leq N \leq 10\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is even) representing
    the number of castles in the world.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print “Yes” if Peach will be guaranteed to be safe forever
    and “No” otherwise.</p>
