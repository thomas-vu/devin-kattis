<p>Born in Warsaw, Benoît Mandelbrot (1924–2010) is considered
    the father of fractal geometry. He studied mathematical
    processes that described self-similar and natural shapes known
    as fractals. Perhaps his most well-known contribution is the
    Mandelbrot set, which is pictured below (the set contains the
    black points):</p>

<p>The Mandelbrot set is typically drawn on the complex plane,
    a 2-dimensional plane representing all complex numbers. The
    horizontal axis represents the real portion of the number, and
    the vertical axis represents the imaginary portion. A complex
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$c = x + yi$</span> (at
    position <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> on the
    complex plane) is <em>not</em> in the Mandelbrot set if the
    following sequence diverges:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ z_{n+1} \leftarrow z_ n^2 + c \]</span>
<p>beginning with <span class="tex2jax_process">$z_0=0$</span>.
    That is, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lim _{n\rightarrow
    \infty } |z_ n| = \infty $</span>. If the sequence does not
    diverge, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is in
    the set.</p>
<p>Recall the following facts about imaginary numbers and their
    arithmetic:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ i = \sqrt {-1},
    \quad i^2 = -1, \quad (x + yi)^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 2xyi, \quad
    |x+yi| = \sqrt {x^2 + y^2} \]</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> are real numbers, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$|\cdot |$</span> is known as the
    <em>modulus</em> of a complex number (in the complex plane, the
    modulus of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x+yi$</span> is equal
    to the straight-line distance from the origin to the the point
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span>).</p>
<p>Write a program which determines if the sequence
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$z_ n$</span> diverges for a
    given value <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> within a
    fixed number of iterations. That is, is <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> in the Mandelbrot set or not? To
    detect divergence, just check to see if <span class="tex2jax_process">$|z_ n| &gt; 2$</span> for any <span class="tex2jax_process">$z_ n$</span> that we compute – if this
    happens, the sequence is guaranteed to diverge.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There are up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span>
    test cases, one per line, up to end of file. Each test case is
    described by a single line containing three numbers: two real
    numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$-3 \leq x, y \leq
    3$</span>, and an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq
    r \leq 10\, 000$</span>. Each real number has at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> digits after the
    decimal point. The value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> for this case is <span class="tex2jax_process">$x + yi$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is the maximum number of
    iterations to compute.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, display the case number followed by whether
    the given <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is in the
    Mandelbrot set, using <tt class="tt">IN</tt> or <tt class="tt">OUT</tt>.</p>
