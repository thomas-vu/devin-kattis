      </div>
</div>After one computer crash too many, Alonso has had enough
    of all this shoddy software and poorly written code! He decides
    that in order for this situation to improve, the glass house
    that is modern programming needs to be torn down and rebuilt
    from scratch using only completely formal axiomatic reasoning.
    As one of the first steps, he decides to implement arithmetic
    with natural numbers using the Peano axioms.
    <p>The Peano axioms (named after Italian mathematican Giuseppe
    Peano) are an axiomatic formalization of the arithmetic
    properties of the natural numbers. We have two symbols: the
    constant <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, and a unary
    successor function <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>.
    The natural numbers, starting at <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, are then <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S(0)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S(S(0))$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S(S(S(0)))$</span>, and so on. With these
    two symbols, the operations of <em>addition</em> and
    <em>multiplication</em> are defined inductively by the
    following axioms: for any natural numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, we have</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{align*} x + 0 &amp; = x &amp; x \cdot
    0 &amp; = 0 \\ x + S(y) &amp; = S(x + y) &amp; x \cdot S(y)
    &amp; = x \cdot y + x \end{align*}</span>
<p>The two axioms on the left define addition, and the two on
    the right define multiplication.</p>
<p>For instance, given <span class="tex2jax_process">$x =
    S(S(0))$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y =
    S(0)$</span> we can repeatedly apply these axioms to
    derive</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{align*} x \cdot
    y &amp; = S(S(0)) \cdot S(0) = S(S(0)) \cdot 0 + S(S(0))\\
    &amp; = 0 + S(S(0)) = S(0 + S(0)) = S(S(0 + 0)) = S(S(0))
    \end{align*}</span>
<p>Write a program which given two natural numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, defined in Peano arithmetic,
    computes the product <span class="tex2jax_process">$x \cdot
    y$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two lines. Each line contains a
    natural number defined in Peano arithmatic, using at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the product of the two input numbers.</p>
