<p>Maaba is playing the game <em>Lumberjack</em>, where the
    goal is to build log huts. Her current customer wants a hut
    made completely out of <em>witchwood</em>, which protects the
    hut from curses, hexes and magic spells – or at least that’s
    what the customer claims.</p>
<p>However, witchwood is not easy to handle: Some witch trees
    are highly volatile, and logs made from those trees will
    spontaneously combust when placed on the hut location. This
    will destroy both the original log and all logs nearby.
    Unfortunately, it is not possible to see the difference before
    the log is placed on the hut location, but it is known that a
    log from location <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> will
    have probability <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span> of
    combusting.</p>
<p>To avoid spending too much time, Maaba has devised a simple
    way to build the hut:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>She uses <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ i$</span>
        seconds to retrieve and place a single witchwood log from
        location <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the hut logs combust, she waits <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> seconds to wait for the fire
        to stop, then collect the ashes. Afterwards, she starts
        over from scratch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If nothing happens, she continues with the next log.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As all locations have an infinite supply of witch trees,
    Maaba knows she will be done eventually. However, she wonders
    how long it would take her on average, if she retrieves logs
    from the right location at the right time. Could you help
    her?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>: The number of logs required to
    build the hut, the number of locations with witchwood, and the
    time it takes for witchwood to stop burning.<br/>
    Then follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines,
    each consisting of an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_
    i$</span>, and a real number <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_
    i$</span>, representing the time it takes to retrieve a log
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and the
    probability that the log will spontaneously combust when
    placed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should be a single real number representing the
    expected time in seconds Maaba will use to build a log hut out
    of only witchwood. Your answer must have an absolute or
    relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N, M \leq
        1000$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq K \leq
        1000$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T_ i \leq
        1000$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq P_ i &lt;
        1$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The result will always be less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{30}$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real numbers in the input will have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> digits after the decimal
        point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Sample Explanation</h2>
<p>In the provided example, the optimal choice is to retrieve a
    log from <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> when she has
    placed <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> logs, a log
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> when she has
    placed <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> log, and a log
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> when she has
    placed <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> logs.</p>
