<div class="problembody">
<p>Your friend just bought a new programmable robot and has
    asked for your help. The robot operates in a 2D grid that may
    contain obstacles. The environment has a known start location
    and a known goal location. The robot is controlled with a
    string consisting of commands <tt class="ttfamily">L</tt>,
    <tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">U</tt>, and
    <tt class="ttfamily">D</tt>, which respectively instruct the
    robot to move one square to the left, right, up or down in the
    grid. The robot will ignore a command (but continue with future
    commands) if the command would cause it to leave the grid or to
    run into an obstacle. If the robot were to reach the goal
    position, it immediately stops its program with success (even
    if further commands exist).</p>
<p>Your friend has already programmed the robot with a command
    string, but the problem is that your friend is not a very good
    programmer, and so it may be that the commands do not lead the
    robot successfully to the goal. You would like to fix the
    string so that the robot will reach the goal, but you do not
    want your friend to feel bad, so you are hoping to make as few
    changes to the program as are needed. A single change consists
    either of deleting an arbitrary character of the command
    string, or inserting an arbitrary command anywhere within the
    string.</p>
<p>As an example, if we consider Sample Input 1, we see
    that your friend’s command string of <tt class="tt">DRRDD</tt>
    does not succeed. The initial <tt class="tt">D</tt> moves the
    robot one spot down. From there, the <tt class="tt">R</tt> (and
    the subsequent <tt class="tt">R</tt>) are ignored because of
    the obstacle to the robot’s right. The subsequent <tt class="tt">D</tt> moves the robot down once again and the final
    <tt class="tt">D</tt> is ignored. However, by deleting the
    initial <tt class="tt">D</tt>, we can rely on the command
    string <tt class="tt">RRDD</tt> which does successfully lead
    the robot to the goal.</p>
<p>If we consider Sample Input 2, we find that your
    friend’s original command string <tt class="tt">LDLDLLDR</tt>
    is flawed. However, if we insert the single command <tt class="tt">U</tt> after the fifth command, the resulting string
    <tt class="tt">LDLDLULDR</tt> successfully guides the robot to
    the goal. It starts by moving left-down-left; the next down
    command is ignored because the robot is not allowed to leave
    the grid. The subsequent left-up-left completes the path to the
    goal (and the final <tt class="tt">DR</tt> commands are ignored
    as the robot stops immediately upon reaching the goal).</p>
<p>With Sample Input 3, your friend’s command string can
    be corrected with two changes, for example with the new command
    <tt class="tt">ULDLDLLDLR</tt> (although this is not the only
    way to use two changes to produce a valid sequence).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains the two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> that respectively define the
    height and width of the grid such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le H, W \le 50$</span>. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> lines each has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> characters, describing
    the corresponding row of the grid, such that the character
    ’<tt class="tt">S</tt>’ designates the starting location,
    ’<tt class="tt">G</tt>’ designates the goal location,
    ’<tt class="tt">#</tt>’ designates an obstacle, and ’<tt class="tt">.</tt>’ designates an empty location. There will always be
    precisely one ’<tt class="tt">S</tt>’ and one ’<tt class="tt">G</tt>’ in the grid, and there will always exist an
    unobstructed path from the start position to the goal position.
    The final line of the input contains your friend’s original
    command string consisting of between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> characters, inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer indicating the minimum number of
    changes that are needed to fix the program.</p>
