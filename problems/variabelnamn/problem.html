<div class="problembody">
<p>Nikolaj has been programming for many years, but never
    really understood the point of writing readable code. Nikolaj’s
    variable names are always <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_3$</span>, etc. Sometimes Nikolaj wants to
    declare a new variable called <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_
    i$</span>, but the name <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_
    i$</span> may already be taken. When that happens he tries the
    names <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_{2i}$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_{3i}$</span>, etc., until he
    finds a name that is not already taken.</p>
<p>Write a program that given a list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> variable names Nikolaj wants to
    use, determines the names he ends up choosing using the above
    strategy.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of variables, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 2 \cdot
    10^5$</span>. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x \leq 10^4$</span>. This means that
    Nikolaj wants to declare a new variable called <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ x$</span>. Nikolaj declares the variables
    in input order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, print
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> such that Nikolaj
    created the variable <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_
    y$</span>.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample Input</h2>
<p>In Sample Input <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, the following will happen:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Variable <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1$</span> is
        declared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Variable <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_3$</span> is
        declared.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nikolaj would like to declare <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1$</span>, but that’s taken, so he
        declares <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_2$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nikolaj would like to declare <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_2$</span>, but that’s taken, so he
        declares <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_4$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nikolaj would like to declare <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1$</span>, but that’s taken, so he
        declares <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_5$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nikolaj would like to declare <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_5$</span>, but that’s taken, so he
        declares <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_{10}$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nikolaj would like to declare <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_5$</span>, but that’s taken, so he
        declares <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_{15}$</span>.</p>
</li>
