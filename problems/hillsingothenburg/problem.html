<p>As most students are aware, Gothenburg somehow seems to have
    more roads going uphill than downhill, regardless of which way
    you’re going. The knowledge of this made Lazy Smurf feel even
    more hopeless when his bicycle broke down in the middle of the
    city, on his way to Smurfette. While the bicycle could ride
    fine downhill, the pedals were broken and he had to walk with
    the bicycle on the uphill roads. Now Lazy Smurf needs your help
    finding the path to Smurfette which makes him have to walk
    uphill the least.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, all of Gothenburg can be represented as a
    graph <a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a>: <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> spots (numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> roads (each road going directly
    between two spots). Each spot in the city has a known height
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_ i$</span>, and if there is a
    direct road between spot <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, the height difference
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_ i-h_ j$</span> is the uphill
    distance to walk (if it is positive). To minimize the amount
    Lazy Smurf has to walk with the bicycle, we want to find the
    path from his location to Smurfette’s which minimizes the total
    height difference for all roads between their locations,
    counting downhill and flat roads as <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> with a space between them.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the number of spots
    in the city, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> is
    the number of roads. <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N, M
    \le 10^5$</span></p>
<p>On the second row, there are two numbers separated by a
    space. The first number is the spot where Lazy Smurf is
    located, the second is the spot where Smurfette is located.</p>
<p>On the third row, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> numbers separated by spaces. The
    numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i \le N$</span>)
    represent the height of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th spot. It is always the case that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$ -10^5 \le h_ i \le 10^5
    $</span>.</p>
<p>On each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> rows, there will be two numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, meaning that there is a road
    between spot <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and spot
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$i \ne j$</span>, and every road will be
    specified exactly once.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one number, the minimum total uphill distance Lazy
    Smurf has to travel to get to Smurfette.</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>In sample one, the best path is to go <tt class="ttfamily">1-2-4</tt>, which has a total uphill distance of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1+0=1$</span>. If you instead
    took the path <tt class="ttfamily">1-3-4</tt>, the total uphill
    distance would have been <span class="tex2jax_process">$0+2=2$</span>.</p>
<p>In sample two, <tt class="ttfamily">1-7-6-5</tt> is one
    example of a path with the minimal upphill distance of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0+4+3=7$</span>. Another
    possibility with uphill distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> is <tt class="ttfamily">1-7-4-5</tt>. An example of a path with a different
    uphill distance is <tt class="ttfamily">1-2-3-4-5</tt>, having
    an uphill distance of <span class="tex2jax_process">$0+3+0+6 =
    9$</span>.</p>
