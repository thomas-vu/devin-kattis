<p>Hello from the future. I am a time traveller. You would
    think that in the future we have agreed to use a single scale
    for measuring temperature. This is not so. In fact, we have all
    sorts of scales now. All the big brands have made their own.
    This is a bit confusing. Please help me figure it out. In my
    day to day work I have to relate to two different scales
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. Help me find a temperature where
    the two scales are the same, so I don’t have to worry about
    it.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of two space-separated integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is the point on <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> is zero. <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> is the number of degrees in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> that equal a change of
    a single degree in <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the temperature where both scales are the same. This
    number must have an absolute or relative error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>. If no such
    temperature exists, output “IMPOSSIBLE” (without the quotes)
    instead. If more than one such point exists, output “ALL GOOD”
    (without the quotes) instead.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$-100 \leq X \leq
        100$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq Y \leq
        100$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
