<div class="problembody">
<p>Some people say ‘The shortest distance between two points is
    a straight line.’ However, this depends on the distance metric
    employed. Between points <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1,y_1)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2,y_2)$</span>, the Euclidean (aka
    straight-line) distance is</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    \sqrt {(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2} \]</span>
<p>However, other distance metrics are often useful. For
    instance, in a city full of buildings, it is often impossible
    to travel in a straight line between two points, since
    buildings are in the way. In this case, the so-called Manhattan
    (or city-block) distance is the most useful:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ |x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2| \]</span>
<p>Both Euclidean and city-block distance are specific
    instances of what is more generally called the family of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>-norms. The distance
    according to norm <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is
    given by</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \left( |x_1 - x_2|
    ^ p + |y_1 - y_2| ^ p \right)^{1/p} \]</span>
<p>If we look at Euclidean and Manhattan distances, these are
    both just specific instances of <span class="tex2jax_process">$p = 2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p=1$</span>, respectively.</p>
<p>For <span class="tex2jax_process">$p &lt; 1$</span> this
    distance measure is not actually a metric, but it may still be
    interesting sometimes. For this problem, write a program to
    compute the <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>-norm
    distance between pairs of points, for a given value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input file contains up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> test cases, each of which
    contains five real numbers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1~
    y_1~ x_2~ y_2~ p$</span>, each of which have at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> digits past the
    decimal point. All coordinates are in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 100]$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0.1, 10]$</span>. The last test case is
    followed by a line containing a single zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case output the <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>-norm distance between the two
    points <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1,y_1)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2,y_2)$</span>. Your answer
    may have absolute or relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.0001$</span>.</p>
