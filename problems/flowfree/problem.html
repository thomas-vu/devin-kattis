<p>Flow Free is a puzzle that is played on a 2D grid of cells,
    with some cells marked as endpoints of certain colors and the
    rest of cells being blank.</p>
<p>To solve the puzzle, you have to connect each pair of
    colored endpoints with a path, following these rules:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>there is a path connecting two points with the same
        color, and that path also has that color</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all cells in the grid are used and each cell belongs to
        exactly one path (of the same color as the endpoints of the
        path)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The rules imply that different colored paths cannot
    intersect.</p>
<p>The path is defined as a connected series of segments where
    each segment connects two neighbouring cells. Two cells are
    neighbours if they share a side (so all segments are either
    horizontal or vertical). By these definitions and rules above,
    each colored cell will be an endpoint of exactly one segment
    and each blank cell will be an endpoint of exactly two
    segments.</p>
<p>In this problem we will consider only the <span class="tex2jax_process">$4 \times 4$</span> puzzle, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> pairs of colored endpoints
    given.</p>
<p>Your task is to determine if a given puzzle is solvable or
    not.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> lines, each line containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> characters. Each
    character is from the set <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ R,
    G, B, Y, W\} $</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> denotes the blank cells and the
    other characters denote endpoints with the specified color. You
    are guaranteed that there will be exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> pairs of colored cells. If there
    are <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> colors in the
    grid, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> will be
    omitted.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>On a single line output either “<tt class="ttfamily">solvable</tt>” or “<tt class="ttfamily">not
    solvable</tt>” (without the quotes).</p>
