<div class="problembody">
<p>In a place in Southwestern Europe, the name of which I do
    not wish to recall, not long ago there were <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cities connected by unidirectional
    roads, with possibly more than one road connecting a city to
    another one, or even to itself. As a homework assignment for
    your geography class, you need to calculate the number of paths
    of length exactly two that were between each pair of cities.
    However, you’ve been too busy celebrating the Spanish victory
    in the World Cup, so now you are copying the answers from your
    friend. You would like to make sure his answers are correct
    before handing in your homework.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> test cases, separated by single
    blank lines. Each test case begins with a line containing the
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span>). The
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> elements each,
    with element <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> of line
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> being the number of
    roads from city <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to
    city <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> (a number between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, inclusive). After that, there
    will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines. Each
    will contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> elements,
    with element <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> of line
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> being the answer from
    your friend for the number of length-<span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> paths from city <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to city <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>; it will be an integer between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> inclusive.</p>
<p>The test cases will finish with a line containing only the
    number zero (also preceded by a blank line).</p>
<h5>Note:</h5>
<p>Large input file; use fast I/O routines.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, your program should output a line. The
    content of this line should be <tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt> if
    your classmate’s solution to the assignment is right, and
    <tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt> otherwise.</p>
