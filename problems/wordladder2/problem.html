<p>A <em>Word Ladder</em> is a puzzle in which you transform
    one word into another, by changing one letter at a time. But,
    there’s a catch: every word that you form in each step must be
    in the dictionary! Here’s an example of how to transform
    <b class="bfseries">CAT</b> into <b class="bfseries">GAS</b>:</p>
<center>
<b class="bfseries">CAT</b> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span> <b class="bfseries">CAR</b> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow
      $</span> <b class="bfseries">WAR</b> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow $</span> <b class="bfseries">WAS</b> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\rightarrow
      $</span> <b class="bfseries">GAS</b>
</center>
<p>Of course, you want to use the fewest number of transitions
    possible. These puzzles can be tough, and often you’ll think to
    yourself: “Darn it! If only [<em>some word</em>] was in the
    dictionary!”</p>
<p>Well, now is your chance! Given a dictionary, and a starting
    and ending word, what ONE single word could you add to the
    dictionary to minimize the number of steps to get from the
    starting word to the ending word, changing only one letter at a
    time, and making sure that every word at every step is in the
    dictionary?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that
    your program may be run multiple times on different inputs.
    Each test case will start with a line with a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>) which indicates
    the number of words in the dictionary. The dictionary will
    follow on the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines, with one word per line. All words will consist of
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> capital letters only,
    and all of the words in a test case will be of the same length.
    The first word in the list will be the starting word of the
    word ladder, and the second will be the ending word of the word
    ladder.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output exactly two lines. The first line holds the one
    single word that you would add to the dictionary, and the
    second holds an integer indicating the minimum number of steps
    to get from the starting word to the ending word, adding your
    word.</p>
<p>It is possible that there’s more than one word you can add
    that will make your path as short as possible. In this case,
    output the solution word that comes first alphabetically.</p>
<p>It is possible that there’s no word you can add that will
    that will make your path any shorter. In this case, output
    <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt> (zero) as the word.</p>
<p>It is possible that there’s no word you can add that makes
    the solution possible. In this case, output <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt> (zero) as the word, and <tt class="ttfamily">-1</tt> as the number of steps.</p>
