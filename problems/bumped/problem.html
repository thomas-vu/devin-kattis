<p>Peter returned from the recently held ACM ICPC World Finals
    only to find that his return flight was overbooked and he was
    bumped from the flight! Well, at least he wasn’t beat up by the
    airline and he’s received a voucher for one free flight between
    any two destinations he wishes.</p>
<p>He is already planning next year’s trip. He plans to travel
    by car where necessary, but he may be using his free flight
    ticket for one leg of the trip. He asked for your help in his
    planning.</p>
<p>He can provide you a network of cities connected by roads,
    the amount it costs to buy gas for traveling between pairs of
    cities, and a list of available flights between some of those
    cities. Help Peter by finding the minimum amount of money he
    needs to spend to get from his hometown to next year’s
    destination!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line
    lists five space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, denoting the number of cities
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; n \le 50\, 000$</span>), the number
    of roads <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le m \le 150\, 000$</span>), the number
    of flights <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le f \le 1\, 000$</span>),
    the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le s &lt; n$</span>) of the
    city in which Peter’s trip starts, and the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le t &lt; n$</span>) of the city Peter is trying to travel to.
    (Cities are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>.)</p>
<p>The first line is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each describing one road. A
    road description contains three space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le i, j &lt; n, i \ne j$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; c \le 50\, 000$</span>), indicating
    there is a road connecting cities <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> that costs <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> cents to travel. Roads can be used
    in either direction for the same cost. All road descriptions
    are unique.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> lines contains a description of an
    available flight, which consists of two space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le u, v &lt; n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$u \ne v$</span>) denoting that a flight from
    city <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> to city
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> is available (though
    not from <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> unless listed
    elsewhere). All flight descriptions are unique.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum number of cents Peter needs to spend to
    get from his home town to the competition, using at most one
    flight. You may assume that there is a route on which Peter can
    reach his destination.</p>
