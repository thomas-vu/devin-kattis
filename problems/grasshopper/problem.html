<div class="problembody">
<p>Gregory is a grasshopper. His favourite food are clover
    leafs—he can simply never have enough of them. Whenever he
    spots such a leaf, he wants to eat it as quickly as possible.
    Gregory is also lazy, so he wants to move to the leaf with
    minimal effort. Your task is to help him to find the shortest
    way to a clover leaf.</p>
<p>For simplicity, we will assume that Gregory lives on a
    rectangular grid consisting of unit squares. As a grasshopper,
    he prefers to move by jumping (or, more exactly, hopping) from
    one square to the other. Each hop takes him to a square that is
    in the adjacent row or column in one direction, and two columns
    or rows away in the other direction. So, his hops resemble the
    moves of a knight on a chessboard.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several test cases, at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 200$</span>, each of them
    specified by six integer numbers on one line: <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$G_
    R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$G_ C$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L_ R$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L_ C$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> specify the size of the grid in
    unit squares, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq R, C \leq
    100$</span>. Gregory cannot hop outside a rectangle of this
    size, because it would be too dangerous. The values of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$G_ R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$G_ C$</span> are the coordinates of the
    square that Gregory is standing on, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L_ R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$L_ C$</span> are the coordinates of the
    square with the delicious clover leaf. (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq G_ R, L_ R \leq R$</span>;
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq G_ C, L_ C \leq
    C$</span>)</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print one integer number—the minimal
    number of hops that Gregory needs to reach the square with his
    beloved delicacy. If it is not possible to reach that square at
    all, print the word “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”
    instead.</p>
