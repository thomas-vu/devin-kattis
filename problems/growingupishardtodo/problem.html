<p>Apple Bloom, Sweetie Belle and Scootaloo were magically
    transformed into adults, and while they’re a little concerned,
    they’re also really excited. They’ll finally be able to do all
    the fun grown-up things they’ve always wanted to do: stay up
    late, eat all the snacks they want, travel the world,
    gamble...</p>

<p>Next on their list: the Appleloosa County Fair!</p>
<p>The Appleloosa County Fair spans multiple days. There are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> activities at the
    fair, which are the same for each day; these activities have
    different opening times (but are also the same for each day),
    so for simplicity we can order the activities, and assume that
    if one wants to do two different activities on any given day,
    say the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span> and
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^\text {th}$</span>
    activities, then if <span class="tex2jax_process">$i &lt;
    j$</span> then the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text
    {th}$</span> activity must be done before the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^\text {th}$</span> activity and
    vice-versa.</p>
<p>Each day they visit the fair, they want to choose a subset
    of the activities to do. Being grown-ups now, of course,
    they’ve developed a more... <i class="itshape">nuanced</i>
    taste for entertainment. In particular, for every day they
    visit the fair:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Apple Bloom wants the activities to be progressively
        more exciting; they cannot do an activity if its level of
        excitement is lower than or equal to any activity they have
        done before on that day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to the above rule, Sweetie Belle wants to do the
        maximum possible number of activities on each day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Subject to the above two rules, Scootaloo wants to make
        sure that each visit to the fair is fresh and unique. If
        today is the <span class="tex2jax_process">$d^\text
        {th}$</span> day they visited the fair, and we denote by
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> the set of the
        levels of excitement of the activities done on the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span> day,
        then <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ d \neq s_ i$</span>
        for all <span class="tex2jax_process">$i &lt;
        d$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</div>
<p>What is the maximum number of days they can visit the fair
    if they follow the above three requirements?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 300\, 000$</span>), the number
    of activities in the Appleloosa County Fair.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_1, A_2, \dots , A_ N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq A_ i \leq 10^9$</span>), denoting the
    levels of excitement of the activities in order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the a single integer on a line by itself, the maximum
    number of days they can visit the fair if they follow the
    requirements.</p>
<p>Since this number can be quite large, you should output only
    the remainder after dividing this number by <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9+7$</span>.</p>
