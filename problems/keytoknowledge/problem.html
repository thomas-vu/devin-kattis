<p>A while ago a class of students took an exam. It consisted
    of true-or-false questions only, but the questions were really
    tough! Even afterward, with the help of the book, lecture notes
    and each other, the students are not sure what all the correct
    answers were. They could ask the professor of course, but he is
    not the kind of guy you would dare to disturb with questions
    that betray your ignorance. Anyway, the students at least have
    an idea of how they performed.</p>
<p>The professor has just returned the exams, but the results
    are not quite as expected. Unfortunately, he did not indicate
    on their exams which answers were right or wrong, he has simply
    put the number of correct answers at the top. So what were the
    correct answers according to the professor then? Given how far
    off some of the grades are from expected, there is a suspicion
    among some of the students that the professor did not count the
    correct answers properly.</p>
<p>Given, for each student, the answers he/she gave and the
    number of correct answers, can you work out what set of correct
    answers matches the results?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 12$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 30$</span>):
        the number of students and the number of questions in the
        exam, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        with <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> digits, each
        digit either <tt>0</tt> or <tt>1</tt>: the answers given by
        each student, with <tt>0</tt> representing “false” and
        <tt>1</tt> representing “true”. This is followed by a space
        and a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq c \leq m$</span>): the number of
        correct answers for that student.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
        digits, each one either <tt>0</tt> or <tt>1</tt>: the
        unique set of correct answers that could account for all
        the results. If there is not exactly one such set, the line
        should read “<tt># solutions</tt>” instead, with the number
        of solutions in place of ‘<tt>#</tt>’.</p>
</li>
