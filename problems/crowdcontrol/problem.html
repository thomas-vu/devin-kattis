<p>The BAPC draws a large number of visitors to Amsterdam. Many
    of these people arrive at the train station, then walk from
    intersection to intersection through the streets of Amsterdam
    in a big parade until they reach the BAPC location.</p>
<p>A street can only allow a certain number of people per hour
    to pass through. This is called the <em>capacity</em> of the
    street. The number of people going through a street must never
    exceed its capacity, otherwise accidents will happen. People
    may walk through a street in either direction.</p>
<p>The BAPC organizers want to prepare a single path from train
    station to BAPC location. They choose the path with maximum
    capacity, where the capacity of a path is defined to be the
    minimum capacity of any street on the path. To make sure that
    nobody walks the wrong way, the organizers close down the
    streets which are incident<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000005"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> to an
    intersection on the path, but not part of the path.</p>
<p>Can you write a program to help the organizers decide which
    streets to block? Given a graph of the streets and
    intersections of Amsterdam, produce the list of streets that
    need to be closed down in order to create a single
    maximum-capacity path from the train station to the BAPC. The
    path must be simple, i.e. it may not visit any
    intersection more than once.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains two integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of intersections
        in the city, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>,
        the number of streets (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le
        n,m \le 1000$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
        lines each specify a single street. A street is specified
        by three integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
        i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span>, where
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> are ids of the
        two <em>intersections</em> that are connected by this
        street (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le a_ i, b_ i
        &lt; n$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_
        i$</span> is the capacity of this street (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le c_ i \le 500000$</span>). Streets
        are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
        to <span class="tex2jax_process">$m-1$</span> in the given
        order.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may assume the following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>All visitors start walking at the train station which is
        the intersection with id <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. The BAPC is located at the
        intersection with id <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The intersections and streets form a connected
        graph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No two streets connect the same pair of
        intersections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No street leads back to the same intersection on both
        ends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is a unique simple path of maximum capacity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing a list of space separated
    street numbers that need to be blocked in order to create a
    single maximum-capacity path from train station to BAPC. Sort
    these street numbers in increasing order.</p>
<p>If no street must be blocked, output the word “<tt class="ttfamily">none</tt>” instead.</p>
