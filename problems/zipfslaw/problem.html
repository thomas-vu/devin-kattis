<p>Harvard linguistics professor George Kingsley Zipf
    (1902-1950) observed that the frequency of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>th most common word in a text is
    roughly proportional to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/k$</span>. He justified his observations
    in a book titled <em>Human behavior and the principle of least
    effort</em> published in 1949. While Zipfâ€™s rationale has
    largely been discredited, the principle still holds, and others
    have afforded it a more sound mathematical basis.</p>
<p>You are to find all the words occurring <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> times in an English text. A word
    is a sequence of letters. Words are separated by non-letters.
    Capitalization should be ignored. A word can be of any length
    that an English word can be.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of several test cases. The first line of each
    case contains a single positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Several lines of text follow
    which will contain no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span> words. The text for each
    case is terminated by a single line containing <tt class="ttfamily">EndOfText</tt>. <tt class="ttfamily">EndOfText</tt>
    does not appear elsewhere in the input and is not considered a
    word.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the words which occur
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> times in the input
    text, one word per line, lower case, in alphabetical order. If
    there are no such words in input, output the following
    line:</p>
<pre>
There is no such word.
</pre>

In practice, the difference between theory and practice is always
greater than the difference between theory and practice in theory.

Man will occasionally stumble over the truth, but most of the
time he will pick himself up and continue on.
