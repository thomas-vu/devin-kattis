<div class="problembody">
<p>You have two pictures of an unusual kind of clock. The clock
    has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> hands, each having
    the same length and no kind of marking whatsoever. Also, the
    numbers on the clock are so faded that you can’t even tell
    anymore what direction is up in the picture. So the only thing
    that you see on the pictures, are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> shades of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> hands, and nothing else.</p>
<p>You’d like to know if both images might have been taken at
    exactly the same time of the day, possibly with the camera
    rotated at different angles.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Given the description of the two images, determine whether
    it is possible that these two pictures could be showing the
    same clock displaying the same time.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n \leq 200\, 000$</span>), the number of hands on the
    clock.</p>
<p>Each of the next two lines contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a_ i &lt; 360\, 000$</span>),
    representing the angles of the hands of the clock on one of the
    images, in thousandths of a degree. The first line represents
    the position of the hands on the first image, whereas the
    second line corresponds to the second image. The number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> denotes the angle
    between the recorded position of some hand and the upward
    direction in the image, measured clockwise. Angles of the same
    clock are distinct and are not given in any specific order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing one word: <tt>possible</tt> if
    the clocks could be showing the same time, <tt>impossible</tt>
    otherwise.</p>
