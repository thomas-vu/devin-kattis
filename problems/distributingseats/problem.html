</div>An airline called <em>Divided Airlines</em> has recently
    made the news due to their tendency to overbook their flights
    rather aggressively. For some flights, they even resorted to
    dragging passengers out from the plane! This was of course not
    very popular, so they decided to “resolve” the issue by making
    the seating assignments very chaotic (airlines do like
    unnecessary complexity).

    <p>A particular flights has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> passengers. The seats are divided
    into <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> rows each
    containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> seats.
    Every passenger <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is
    assigned to some particular seat located at row <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> and column <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span>. However, some passengers may
    be assigned to the same seat.</p>
<p>Of course, passengers are usually okay with sitting
    somewhere else than their assigned seat, but they may still
    want to be somewhat close to their original seat. Perhaps they
    want to be able to speak to their friends, or sit close to
    their overhead luggage. More specifically, passenger
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> accepts sitting at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> rows away from
    the row on their ticket.</p>
<p>Due to budget reasons, you decided to travel on a Divided
    flight. As expected, all the passengers assigned to an
    overbooked seat started to fight with each other, moving around
    in complex ways and causing a long delay. You proposed a fair
    resolution: you will construct a seat assignment which takes
    into account how far the passengers accepts to sit from their
    assigned seats so that as many passengers as possible get a
    seat. Now, all that remains is to actually find this
    assignment.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n, r, c \le 10^5$</span>), the
        number of passengers, rows and columns in the flight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines with the
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i, b_ i$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a_ i \le r$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le b_ i \le c$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le s_ i \le r$</span>).
        The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th line has
        the assigned row <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
        i$</span> and column <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_
        i$</span>, and maximum distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th passenger. The maximum
        distance is given in rows.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum number of passengers that can be assigned
    a seat in an optimal assignment.</p>
