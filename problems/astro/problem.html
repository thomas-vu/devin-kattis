<p>Ivica and Marica are attending astronomy classes and are
    observing two unusual stars. They noted the time when each of
    them flashed. They further noticed that each of the stars
    flashes periodically, at regular intervals, and now they are
    wondering: on what day, at what hour will the stars flash at
    the <em>same</em> minute for the <em>first time</em>?</p>
<p>For example, if the first star flashed today (Saturday) at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$02$</span>:<span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> and the second one at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span>:<span class="tex2jax_process">$00$</span>, with the first star flashing
    every <span class="tex2jax_process">$05$</span>:<span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> (every <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> hours and <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> minutes) and the second every
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$01$</span>:<span class="tex2jax_process">$00$</span> (each hour), then the first one
    will flash again at <span class="tex2jax_process">$08$</span>:<span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>:<span class="tex2jax_process">$00$</span>, and the second one at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>:<span class="tex2jax_process">$00$</span>. Therefore, both stars will have
    flashed at the same minute today at <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>:<span class="tex2jax_process">$00$</span>.</p>
<p>Note that the time <span class="tex2jax_process">$00$</span>:<span class="tex2jax_process">$00$</span> (midnight) is the first minute of
    a day.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Four lines containing four timestamps in <span class="tex2jax_process">$HH$</span>:<span class="tex2jax_process">$MM$</span> format (hours:minutes), with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$00 \le HH \le 23$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$00 \le MM \le 59$</span>.</p>
<p>The timestamps are, in order: the time of the first star’s
    flash, the time of the second star’s flash, the time between
    consecutive flashes of the first star, the time between
    consecutive flashes of the second star.</p>
<p>The first two timestamps will differ, and both fall on the
    same day – <em>Saturday</em>. Flash intervals will not be
    00:00.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the stars will never flash at the same minute, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">Never</tt>” in a single line.</p>
<p>Otherwise, output in the first line the name of the weekday
    of the first same-minute flash. A reminder on the correct
    spelling of weekdays: “Sunday”, “Monday”, “Tuesday”,
    “Wednesday”, “Thursday”, “Friday” and “Saturday”.</p>
<p>In the second line, output the timestamp of the first
    same-minute flash, in <span class="tex2jax_process">$HH$</span>:<span class="tex2jax_process">$MM$</span> format (with a leading zero for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$HH$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$MM$</span> if they are less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>).</p>
