<p>For a boat on a large body of water, strong currents can be
    dangerous, but with careful planning, they can be harnessed to
    help the boat reach its destination. Your job is to help in
    that planning.</p>
<p>At each location, the current flows in some direction. The
    captain can choose to either go with the flow of the current,
    using no energy, or to move one square in any other direction,
    at the cost of one energy unit. The boat always moves in one of
    the following eight directions: north, south, east, west,
    northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest. The boat cannot
    leave the boundary of the lake. You are to help him devise a
    strategy to reach the destination with the minimum energy
    consumption.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The lake is represented as a rectangular grid. The first
    line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, the number of rows and columns in
    the grid. The grid has no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\ 000$</span> rows and no more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\ 000$</span> columns. Each of
    the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines
    contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>
    characters, each a digit from <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt> to
    <tt class="ttfamily">7</tt> inclusive. The character <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt> means the current flows north (i.e. up in the
    grid, in the direction of decreasing row number), <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt> means it flows northeast, <tt class="ttfamily">2</tt> means east (i.e. in the direction of
    increasing column number), <tt class="ttfamily">3</tt> means
    southeast, and so on in a clockwise manner:</p>

<p>The line after the grid contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of trips
    to be made, which is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>. Each of the following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines describes a trip
    using four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_
    s$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ s$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ d$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ d$</span>, giving the row and column of
    the starting point and the destination of the trip. Rows and
    columns are numbered starting with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each trip, output a line containing a single integer,
    the minimum number of energy units needed to get from the
    starting point to the destination.</p>
