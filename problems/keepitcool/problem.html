</div>As the workload of the semester is ramping up you get the
    task of refilling the fridge in the lab with soda. The fridge
    has <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> slots, each with a
    capacity for <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> bottles
    of soda, and you have <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    new soda bottles to add to the fridge. The sodas currently in
    the fridge are all nice and cold, but the new ones are not and
    need to be cooled in the fridge for a while until they are
    ready to drink.
    <p>You can only refill the fridge from the front, so in an
    ideal world, you would first take out all the sodas currently
    in the fridge, then put in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> new ones, and then put the old and
    cold sodas in front of the new ones. But in an ideal world you
    would also not have two exams and a homework deadline coming.
    You are simply way too busy to do all this work.</p>
<p>Instead, you are going to just put the new bottles in the
    front of the fridge and hope for the best. However, you can
    still to be clever about which slots to put the new sodas in.
    Each time a student comes for a soda, they will take one from
    the front of a uniformly random non-empty slot in the fridge.
    You decide to add the new bottles to the fridge so as to
    maximize the probability that all the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> students getting a soda from the
    fridge will get a cold one.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n, m, s, d \le 100$</span>), the number of new soda
    bottles, number of students to optimize for, number of slots in
    the fridge, and capacity of each slot, respectively. Then
    follows a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1, \ldots , c_ s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le c_ i \le d$</span> for each
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span> is the number of soda bottles
    currently in slot <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> of
    the fridge.</p>
<p>You may assume that there is free space for all the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> new bottles in the
    fridge.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If there is a chance that all the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> students will get a cold bottle,
    then output <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> integers
    describing a refill scheme for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> soda bottles that maximizes the
    probability of this happening. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> of these <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> integers indicates how many of the
    new bottles are placed in the front of slot <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> in the fridge. If there are
    multiple optimal refill schemes, output any one of them.
    Otherwise, if it is impossible for all the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> students to get a cold soda,
    output “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>” instead.</p>
