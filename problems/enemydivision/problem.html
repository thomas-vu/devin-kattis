<p>Captain Keram has to make a difficult decision. It is year
    2147 and there is a big war in the world. His soldiers have
    been together since the war started, two years ago, and some of
    them have become enemies. Luckily, each soldier has at most 3
    enemies.</p>
<p>They need to attack another country soon, and Keram is
    worried that soldiers who are enemies might not cooperate well
    during the battle. He has decided to divide them into groups
    such that every soldier has at most one enemy in his group. He
    also wants to make it simple, so he wants to use as few groups
    as possible. Can you divide the soldiers into groups for
    him?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input On the first line there are two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq n\leq 100\, 000, 0 \leq m\leq
    3n/2$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is
    the number of soldiers and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number of enemy pairs. Then
    follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each
    containing two space separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i, b_ i$</span>, denoting that soldiers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> are enemies, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq a_ i &lt; b_ i\leq n$</span>. You can
    assume that all soldiers have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> enemies.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first line of output contains the minimal number of
    groups of soldiers <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>.
    Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines
    contains a space separated list of a soldiers in a unique
    group.</p>
