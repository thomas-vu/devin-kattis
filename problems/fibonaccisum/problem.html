<div class="problembody">
<p>All positive integers can be written as a sum of Fibonacci
    numbers (for example, the trivial solution <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 + 1 + 1 + \dots + 1$</span>). A harder
    problem is to write it as the sum of as few Fibonacci numbers
    as possible. For example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> can be written as <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 + 5$</span>, while <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> requires three numbers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 + 3 + 8$</span>. Your task is
    to write a program that finds this shortest representation.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a shortest sequence of Fibonacci numbers that sum to
    the input. You should output them in increasing order,
    separated by spaces. If there are several possible shortest
    sequences, any one will be accepted.</p>
