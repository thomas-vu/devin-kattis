<p>Is a world without cookies really worth living in? Alf and
    Beata do not think so. That’s why they spent the entire weekend
    baking an enormous amount of cookies. They baked <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> almond biscuits, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> butter cookies and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> chocolate macarons.</p>
<p>It is now time to eat all these delicious cookies with their
    friends. The cookies will be divided up among all the friends.
    However, this division must be done such that everyone can eat
    all of their cookies without having to eat the same kind of
    cookie twice in a row (that would be very unpleasant).</p>
<p>Furthermore, Alf and Beata wants as few cookies as possible
    to go to waste – they spent a lot of time preparing them, after
    all. Can you determine the maximum amount of cookies that can
    be distributed among everyone?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line contains four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 10^9$</span>), the number of friends eating cookies
    including Alf and Beata, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le A, B, C \le 10^9$</span>), the amount of cookies of each of
    the three times Alf and Beata baked.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer – the number of cookies Alf and
    Beata are able to distribute.</p>
