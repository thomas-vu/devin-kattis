<p>Liam is planning out his route for an upcoming nature hike.
    Unfortunately, the region that he plans on hiking through is
    notoriously muddy, so in order to prevent his floral shirt from
    getting covered with mud, he has decided to pick a route for
    which the maximum depth of mud encountered is minimized.</p>
<p>The terrain is modelled as a two-dimensional grid, with
    nonnegative integers giving the depth of the mud in each cell
    in micrometers (millionths of a meter). The hike must begin at
    one of the cells in the leftmost column of the grid and finish
    at one of the cells in the rightmost column of the grid. Liam
    is allowed to move either north, south, east, or west, but he
    cannot travel diagonally.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two space-separated
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2 \leq r, c \leq 1\, 000)$</span>,
    indicating the number of rows and the number of columns in the
    grid, respectively. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> space-separated integers,
    indicating the depth of mud in the cells of the corresponding
    grid row from left to right. Each depth is measured in
    micrometers and is given as an integer in the interval
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0,1\, 000\, 000]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should contain a single integer, the depth of the
    deepest mud that Liam is forced to hike through if his route
    minimizes this value.</p>
