<p><em>Note that this is a harder version of the problem
    <b class="bfseries">anti11</b></em>.<br/></p>
<p>Danny Ocean likes many things: casinos, elaborate heists,
    and complicated romantic relationships. But it’s a little-known
    fact that Danny loves binary strings most of all — binary
    strings of any length and composition. One day, however, he
    suddenly develops a mysterious allergy to all binary strings
    containing the substring <tt class="ttfamily"><b class="bfseries">11</b></tt>. This strange illness lasts exactly one
    week, during which time he has to work very hard to avoid any
    such “contaminated” binary strings. At the end of the week, the
    allergy vanishes as unexpectedly as it appeared, and for a
    brief moment Danny is elated that all binary strings are again
    available for him to enjoy. Alas, this hope is short lived, for
    no sooner has the first allergy disappeared than it is replaced
    by anther, this time to all binary strings containing the
    substring <tt class="ttfamily"><b class="bfseries">10101</b></tt>. The second allergy also lasts
    exactly one week, after which it is replaced by yet another,
    and another, and so on, one per week, ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Danny has (mostly) adjusted to his allergic affliction, and
    is optimistic that there are still plenty of binary strings for
    him to enjoy each week, but he’s not sure exactly how many, so
    he has hired you to write a program to find out.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 100$</span>) representing the
    number of test cases. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines, each of which contains a
    single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10\, 000$</span>)
    followed by a non-empty string <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> consisting only of the characters
    <tt class="ttfamily"><b class="bfseries">0</b></tt> and
    <tt class="ttfamily"><b class="bfseries">1</b></tt>. The length
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> is at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    lines, one per case. The output for a given case is the number
    of binary strings of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> that do not
    contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> as a
    substring. Since these values can be quite large, output each
    value mod <span class="tex2jax_process">$(10^9 +
    7)$</span>.</p>
