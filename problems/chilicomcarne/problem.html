<p>Programmers all know COM, which is of course an abbreviation
    for Cost Of Maintenance and has no other interpretations. Often
    such costs can be lowered by automating certain tasks, but many
    programmers are overzealous in this regard and end up spending
    more time programming an automatic solution than it would have
    taken them to do the task by hand for the rest of their
    lives.</p>
<p>To rectify this a program has to be made that can
    automatically determine whether it is worth it to write a
    program to automate things. As this program does not yet exist
    we can’t say whether it’s worth it to write this program, so
    that’ll just have to be revealed in due time.</p>
<p>We measure time using a few different units, with the
    largest one being a year. A single year has <span class="tex2jax_process">$52$</span> weeks. Each week has <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> work days and each work day has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> work hours. Finally
    there are of course <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span>
    minutes to an hour and <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span> seconds to a minute.</p>
<p>Given how often the task has to be done, how long it takes
    to do it, and how long it would take to automate it, make a
    program that can tell how much time it would save to automate
    the task over the course of the next five years. The saved time
    is measured starting from the program being finished.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line gives how often the task needs to be
    performed, given as <tt class="ttfamily">n sinnum daglega</tt>
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is an integer
    and <tt class="ttfamily">daglega</tt> means daily. If
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is one the second word
    is replaced with <tt class="ttfamily">sinni</tt>. The third
    word can also be <tt class="ttfamily">vikulega</tt> which means
    weekly or <tt class="ttfamily">arlega</tt> which means yearly.
    The next line gives how long it takes to perform the task each
    time, given as <tt class="ttfamily">n sekundur</tt> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is an integer and
    <tt class="ttfamily">sekundur</tt> means seconds. Instead of
    <tt class="ttfamily">sekundur</tt> the second word can also be
    <tt class="ttfamily">minutur</tt> (minutes), <tt class="ttfamily">klukkustundir</tt> (hours), <tt class="ttfamily">dagar</tt> (days), <tt class="ttfamily">vikur</tt>
    (weeks), <tt class="ttfamily">ar</tt> (years). If <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = 1$</span> the input contains the
    singular form of the word instead, i.e. one of <tt class="ttfamily">sekunda</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">minuta</tt>,
    <tt class="ttfamily">klukkustund</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">dagur</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">vika</tt> or
    <tt class="ttfamily">ar</tt>, given in the same order as above.
    Finally the third and last line gives how much time it would
    take to automate the task, given in the same format as the line
    before. <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is always a
    positive integer with value at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. Note that since the task might
    be taken care of by more than a single person it is possible
    that it takes more than five years to perform the task over the
    next five years in total.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the number of seconds the program would save over
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> years. If automating
    the task takes strictly more time than doing the task manually
    over the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> years,
    instead print <tt class="ttfamily">Borgar sig ekki!</tt>.</p>
