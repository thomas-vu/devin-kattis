<p>Jimmy and his friends were all standing in a lineup for ice
    cream when a huge gust blew them all around. The friends want
    to keep things fair and make sure everyone gets their ice cream
    in the order they started with. The friends do not remember the
    order, but each of them remember exactly how many people were
    between them and Jimmy. Jimmy is always the first person in
    line. Can you help him and his friends remember the order?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 100$</span>), the number of people in the line.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> space separated integers, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq d_ i \leq n-2$</span>) is the number
    of people between the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i+1)^\textrm {th}$</span> person and
    Jimmy.</p>
<p>Jimmy is always first in the lineup.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers, the people in the order
    of the original lineup. It is guaranteed that there is always a
    unique solution.</p>
