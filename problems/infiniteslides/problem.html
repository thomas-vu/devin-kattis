<p>Agneta and Beata are visiting the famous Swedish Amusement
    Park of Infinite Fun and Games. Their favourite attraction is
    the Infinitely Long Slides. Each slide can be viewed as an
    infinitely long, completely vertical spiral of radius
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<p>When projected into the (flat) ground, the first slide has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 0)$</span> as its centre
    point, and the second one has <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 0)$</span> as its centre point.
    Furthermore, the start of the slides are at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 0)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 0)$</span> respectively, and then
    proceeds counter-clockwise around their respective centres.
    When Agneta rides her slide (the first one), she does so with
    vertical speed <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\text {
    m/s}$</span>, while Beatas slide has a bit higher gradient, so
    she goes with vertical speed <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\text { m/s}$</span>. However, their
    angular speeds around the centre is both equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \text { rad/s}$</span>. Since Beata is a
    little afraid of the slides, she always waits for Agneta to go
    first. <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> seconds after
    Agneta went, Beata starts her descent.</p>
<p>To make the infinite ride a bit more fun, the amusement park
    gives a prize if the two riders on the slides manage to pass a
    ball between them at some point. This prize consists of a lot
    of chocolate, which is Beata’s favourite treat. To maximize
    their chances of passing the ball successfully, they want to
    wait until their Euclidean distance is the smallest possible
    during the ride. How small will this distance be?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of the input contains the decimal
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le W \le 1000$</span>.
    The number contains at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> digits after the decimal
    point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single number – the minimal Euclidean distance
    between Agneta and Beata during their trip. Your answer will be
    accepted if it is within a relative or absolute error of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span> of the judges’
    answer.</p>
