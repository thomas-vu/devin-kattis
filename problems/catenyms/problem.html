<p>A catenym is a pair of words separated by a period such that
    the last letter of the first word is the same as the first
    letter of the second. For example, the following are
    catenyms:</p>
<pre>
dog.gopher
gopher.rat
rat.tiger
aloha.aloha
arachnid.dog
</pre>
<p>A compound catenym is a sequence of three or more words
    separated by periods such that each adjacent pair of words
    forms a catenym. For example,</p>
<pre>
aloha.aloha.arachnid.dog.gopher.rat.tiger
</pre>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Given a dictionary of lower case words, you are to find a
    compound catenym that contains each of the words exactly once.
    The first line of standard input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, the number of test cases. Each
    test case begins with <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le n
    \le 1000$</span> – the number of words in the dictionary.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> distinct dictionary
    words follow; each word is a string of between 1 and 20
    lowercase letters on a line by itself.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line giving the
    lexicographically smallest compound catenym that contains each
    dictionary word exactly once. Output “<tt class="ttfamily">***</tt>” if there is no solution.</p>
