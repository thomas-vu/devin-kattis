<p>Forrest lives in a prehistoric era of “dial-up Internet.”
    Unlike the fast streaming of today’s broadband era, dial-up
    connections are only capable of transmitting small amounts of
    text data at reasonable speeds. Forrest has noticed that his
    communications typically include repeated characters, and has
    designed a simple compression scheme based on repeated
    information. Text data is encoded for transmission, possibly
    resulting in a much shorter data string, and decoded after
    transmission to reveal the original data.</p>
<p>The compression scheme is rather simple. When encoding a
    text string, repeated consecutive characters are replaced by a
    single instance of that character and the number of occurrences
    of that character (the character’s <em>run length</em>).
    Decoding the encoded string results in the original string by
    repeating each character the number of times encoded by the run
    length. Forrest calls this encoding scheme <em>run-length
    encoding</em>. (We don’t think he was actually the first person
    to invent it, but we haven’t mentioned that to him.)</p>
<p>For example, the string <tt class="ttfamily">HHHeelllo</tt>
    is encoded as <tt class="ttfamily">H3e2l3o1</tt>. Decoding
    <tt class="ttfamily">H3e2l3o1</tt> results in the original
    string. Forrest has hired you to write an implementation for
    his run-length encoding algorithm.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single line of text. The line starts
    with a single letter: <tt class="ttfamily">E</tt> for encode or
    <tt class="ttfamily">D</tt> for decode. This letter is followed
    by a single space and then a message. The message consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters.</p>
<p>Each string to <em>encode</em> contains only upper- and
    lowercase English letters, underscores, periods, and
    exclamation points. No consecutive sequence of characters
    exceeds <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>
    repetitions.</p>
<p>Each string to <em>decode</em> has even length. Its
    characters alternate between the same characters as strings to
    encode and a single digit between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, indicating the run length for the
    preceding character.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>On an input of <tt class="ttfamily">E</tt> output the
    run-length encoding of the provided message. On an input of
    <tt class="ttfamily">D</tt> output the original string
    corresponding to the given run-length encoding.</p>
