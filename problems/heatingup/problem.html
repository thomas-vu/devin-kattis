        pizza</a> by Rahul Upadhyay, Unsplash
      </div>
</div>Jonas just entered his first chilli-eating contest. He is
    presented with a pizza consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> slices, numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, each containing a selection of
    chilli peppers. Initially slices <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+1$</span> are adjacent on the plate (where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i &lt; n$</span>), and so
    are slices <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. According to the
    contest rules only one slice can be consumed at a time, and the
    slice must be finished in its entirety before a new slice is
    started. Jonas is allowed to pick any slice to eat first, but
    after that he is only allowed to eat slices that have at most
    one remaining adjacent slice.
    <p>The spiciness of each slice is measured in Scoville Heat
    Units (SHU). Jonas has a certain spiciness tolerance, also
    measured in SHU, which corresponds to the spiciness of the
    spiciest slice that Jonas can tolerate eating. He has also
    noticed that, after eating a slice of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> SHU, his tolerance immediately
    increases by <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>.</p>
<p>In order to win the contest, Jonas would like to finish all
    the slices of his pizza. Help him determine the minimum initial
    spiciness tolerance necessary to do so while abiding by the
    contest rules.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^{5}$</span>), the
        number of pizza slices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_{1}, s_{2},
        \ldots , s_{n}$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
        \le s_{i} \le 10^{13}$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> is the spiciness of the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th slice in
        SHU.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum initial spiciness tolerance in SHU that
    Jonas needs in order to be able to eat all slices of the
    pizza.</p>
