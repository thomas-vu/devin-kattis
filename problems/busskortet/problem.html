<p>You are going to purchase a bus card. It’s a refillable card
    that cash can be deposited into, and then used to ride the bus
    until you are out of money. You know that you’re planning to
    travel for <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> Swedish
    crowns (SEK). Charging the card takes some time since you can
    only charge it with <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span> SEK at a time.</p>
<p>At the moment you are in a hurry, so you want to make as few
    transactions as possible, but never insert more money than
    necessary. If you are to travel for <span class="tex2jax_process">$800$</span> SEK, this means you should load
    it with <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span>, then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span>, and then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> SEK. On the other
    hand, if you are traveling for <span class="tex2jax_process">$850$</span> SEK you should load it first
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span>, and then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> SEK twice.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> SEK will be wasted,
    but it’s still the best alternative.</p>
<p>Compute the minimum number of transactions necessary.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le K \le 10\, 000$</span>), the amount you will travel
    for.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer – the number of transactions
    necessary.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>The problem can give up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> points.</p>
<p>In cases worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$33$</span>
    points, you will never have to insert more money than the
    amount you travel for.</p>
