<p>You regularly play a game with friends, and you’re tired of
    losing. The goal of the game is to end up with the largest
    number in your hand at the end. Initially there is a set of
    unique numbers on the table. At each turn, a player chooses a
    number from the table and puts it in his hand. Seems simple,
    right? However, you may be required to discard numbers in your
    hand.</p>
<p>During the game, each number can either be on the table, in
    a player’s hand, or in a discard pile. When a player chooses a
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> from the table,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is compared with all
    other numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> that are
    not on the table (including other players’ hands, your own
    hand, and those in the discard pile). If <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> have a common factor greater than
    1, both are moved to (or remain in) the discard pile. The game
    ends when all numbers have been chosen from the table.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input line describes the set of numbers on the table at
    the beginning of a game. The line begins with a number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1000$</span>.
    Following this are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    unique positive integers, all in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[2,~ 2\times 10^9]$</span>. These are the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> numbers that are
    initially on the table. There are at most 1000 games in the
    input. Input ends at end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each game print the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> from the table such that choosing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> guarantees you win the
    game. Each game has a unique winning number.</p>
