<p>Sanic Hegehog likes to go fast. While Sanic can run, he
    especially enjoys curling himself up into a ball and rolling
    really fast downhill through loops. Sanic tries and fails to
    count the number of rotations he makes while spinning through a
    loop: spinning so fast makes him dizzy and confused. You,
    Sanic’s faithful sidekick, try to help with the counting but
    it’s futile – all you see is a blue blur of movement when Sanic
    rolls around a loop so fast. Perhaps you can write a program to
    calculate the number of rotations instead?</p>
<p>To simplify things, we measure the world in terms of Sanic
    radii. While spinning through a loop, Sanic can be accurately
    modeled as a circle of radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Furthermore, the inside of the
    loops Sanic spins through can be modeled as circles with radius
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (measured in Sanic
    radii). We also know that <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> will always be at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1.10$</span> as Sanic does not
    attempt to spin through smaller loops. Sanic spins clockwise
    and he follows the loop counter-clockwise, as illustrated in
    the diagram.</p>

        Illustration of Sanic’s motion through a loop. The small
        circle represents Sanic (radius=<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>), the large circle represents
        the loop (radius=<span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>).

<p>You need to compute <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, the number of revolutions it
    takes for Sanic to make exactly one complete lap in the loop.
    Sanic does not slip - he always has perfect contact with the
    inside of the loop. The loops are rigid and do not move at all.
    Remember to go fast and compute the answer quickly!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single line with one decimal number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>: the radius of the
    loop relative to the radius of Sanic. The number <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is given in decimal form with
    exactly two digits and satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$1.10 \le r \leq 1000.00$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, as specified
    above, with a relative or absolute error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
