<div class="problembody">
<p>You are studying <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    microbes. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text
    {th}$</span> microbe has initial x-coordinate <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span> nanometers and will travel
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ i$</span> nanometers in the
    positive x-direction each second.</p>
<p>All these x-coordinates are initially distinct. You know
    that these microbes are incredibly amorphous, so that if one of
    them touches another one (that is, they occupy the exact same
    x-coordinate at the same time) they will merge together,
    ruining the whole study. To this end, you want to separate the
    microbes into <i class="itshape">rows</i> (where each row has a
    distinct y-coordinate) before the study begins, such that no
    two microbes will ever touch each other, no matter how long you
    observe them.</p>
<p>It is hard to keep track of too many rows, so you want to
    minimize the total number of rows you have to separate the
    microbes into. How should you separate these microbes such that
    the minimum number of rows is needed?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 200\, 000$</span>), the number
    of microbes.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines of
    input contain the descriptions of the microbes. In particular,
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span> of
    these lines contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq P_ i \leq 10^9$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i \neq P_ j$</span> for <span class="tex2jax_process">$i \neq j$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq S_ i \leq 10^9$</span>), denoting
    that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span>
    microbe has initial x-coordinate <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span> nanometers and will travel
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ i$</span> nanometers in the
    positive x-direction each second.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> distinct integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_1, r_2, \dots , r_ N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq r_ i \leq N$</span>), the rows the
    microbes should be located. There must be at least one microbe
    on each row; that is, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i =
    k$</span> for some <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    implies, for all positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k’ &lt; k$</span>, the existence of some
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ j = k’$</span>. The configuration you
    provide should not allow any two microbes to touch each other
    at any point, and, among all such configurations satisfying
    that criteria, use the minimum possible number of rows.</p>
<p>If there are multiple correct answers, you can output any of
    them.</p>
