<p>Catherine is a brilliant software engineer, but she has been
    having difficulty landing a job, despite having submitted a
    superb resume to dozens of tech companies. After doing some
    research, she discovered that most tech companies in her area
    use an algorithm to prescreen resumes by scanning for certain
    keywords before the resume is even seen by a human. Any resume
    that does not contain sufficiently many technology-related
    keywords is automatically rejected!</p>
<p>Catherine has devised a plan to outwit the prescreening
    algorithm: she intends to cram as many keywords as possible
    into her resume to maximize her chances of passing the
    prescreening process. As a first step, she has downloaded a
    list of the most common tech buzzwords from an online data bank
    that includes entries such as “machine learning”, “Big data”,
    “AI”, “C++”, “Neural-network”, “unix”, “cryptography”, etc.
    (Note that <em>keyword</em> sometimes really means
    <em>keyphrase</em>.)</p>
<p>In the early stages of drafting her new resume, Catherine
    notices that many keywords from the data bank are very similar
    to each other (e.g., “Machine-learning” vs. “machine learning”,
    or “MySQL” vs. “MySql”). Since she suspects that including
    nearly identical keywords won’t help her fool the prescreening
    algorithm, she wants to filter out such similar keywords in
    order to save room on her resume. Catherine considers two
    keywords <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_2$</span> to be similar if,
    after replacing hyphens with spaces and ignoring
    capitalization, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_1$</span> is
    the same as <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_2$</span>.</p>
<p>Can you help Catherine craft the perfect resume to land her
    a job?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq n \leq 40\, 000)$</span>, the number of keywords in the
    data bank. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each of which contains a
    keyword string <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> that is
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> characters in length
    (inclusive). All characters in a keyword are guaranteed to fall
    in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$[32, 126]$</span> ASCII
    range, and no keyword begins or ends with a space or a
    hyphen.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing the number of (pairwise)
    non-similar keywords in the data bank.</p>
