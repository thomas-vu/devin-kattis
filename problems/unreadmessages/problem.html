<div class="problembody">
<p>There is a group of people in an internet email message
    group. Messages are sent to all members of the group, and no
    two messages are sent at the same time.</p>
<p>Immediately before a person sends a message, they read all
    their unread messages up to that point. Each sender also reads
    their own message the moment it is sent. Therefore, a person’s
    unread messages are exactly the set of messages sent after that
    person’s last message.</p>
<p>Each time a message is sent, compute the total number of
    unread messages over all group members.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 10^9$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le m \le 1\, 000$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of people in the
    group, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the
    number of messages sent. The group members are identified by
    number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le s \le n$</span>), which is the sender of that message.
    These lines are in chronological order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each
    with a single integer, indicating the total number of unread
    messages over all group members, immediately after each message
    is sent.</p>
