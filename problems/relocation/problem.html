<p>In the faraway country of Lineland, tech companies are
    starting to take over! Every week, it seems that tech companies
    sprout from the ground, merge, get acquired, or go under. For
    software engineers looking for new jobs in Lineland, it can be
    difficult to even find the companies where they’re
    interviewing.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, you’re going to make a new tech
    company! The product is simple: using deep neural blockchains
    in the cloud, your app finds the distance between any two tech
    companies in Lineland. This is supremely useful, as companies
    change offices all the time and it’s difficult to stay
    completely up to date. By centralizing this information, your
    company is going to make the world a better place.</p>
<p>Since Lineland is organized around a single line, the
    location of a company can be given by a single coordinate. The
    distance between any two companies is equal to the distance
    between their two coordinates.</p>
<p>Your job is to handle two kinds of user requests to the
    company’s flagship app. One kind of request updates the address
    of a company, the other requests the shortest distance between
    two companies.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line has two positive space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>: the number of companies the app
    tracks (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le N \le 100\,
    000$</span>), and the number of requests to process
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le Q \le 100\, 000$</span>).
    The next line has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le
    X_ i \le 10^9$</span>, which are the initial locations of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> companies, given in
    order from <span class="tex2jax_process">$i=1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i=N$</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>
    lines has <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>
    space-separated integers, taking one of the following
    forms:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1~ C~ X$</span>, which
        means that company <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>
        moves its location to <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$2~ A~ B$</span>, which is
        a query for the distance between companies <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq
    A, B, C \leq N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq X \leq 10^9$</span>. It is possible two companies can
    share the same location. It is also guaranteed there is at
    least one query of type <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query of type <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, print the distance between
    companies <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>.</p>
<h2>Sample Explanation</h2>
<p>In the first query, Company <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> moves to location <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. Then the app is asked for the
    distance between company <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> and company <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, which is <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. The next query is the distance
    between companies <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, which is also
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. A number of updates
    and queries follow.</p>
