<p>Canada has a multi-party system of government. Each
    candidate is generally associated with a party, and the party
    whose candidates win the most ridings generally forms the
    government. Some candidates run as independents, meaning they
    are not associated with any party. Your job is to count the
    votes for a particular riding and to determine the party with
    which the winning candidate is associated.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> satisfying
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le n \le 20$</span>, the
    number of candidates in the riding. <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> pairs of lines follow: the first
    line in each pair is the name of the candidate; the second line
    is the name of the party, or the word “independent” if the
    candidate has no party. No candidate name is repeated and no
    party name appears more than once in this part of the
    input.</p>
<p>The next line contains a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m \le 10\, 000$</span>, and is followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each indicating
    the name of a candidate for which a ballot is cast. Any names
    not in the list of candidates should be ignored.</p>
<p>Each name line consists of at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$80$</span> characters, uses only ASCII
    characters <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$126$</span> (inclusive), and
    does not contain any leading or trailing blanks.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output consists of a single line containing one of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The name of the party with whom the winning candidate is
        associated, if there is a winning candidate and that
        candidate is associated with a party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The word “<tt class="ttfamily">independent</tt>” if
        there is a winning candidate and that candidate is not
        associated with a party.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The word “<tt class="ttfamily">tie</tt>” if there is no
        winner; that is, if no candidate receives more votes than
        every other candidate.</p>
</li>
</ul>
