</div>You are the CEO of Nasty Hacks Inc., a company that
    creates small pieces of malicious software which teenagers may
    use to fool their friends. The company has just finished their
    first product and it is time to sell it. You want to make as
    much money as possible and consider advertising in order to
    increase sales. You get an analyst to predict the expected
    revenue, both with and without advertising. You now want to
    make a decision as to whether you should advertise or not,
    given the expected revenues.

    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cases, and the first line consists
    of one positive integer giving <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>. The first, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, is the expected revenue if you do
    not advertise, the second, <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span>, is the expected revenue if you do
    advertise, and the third, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, is the cost of advertising. You
    can assume that the input will follow these restrictions:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^{6} \leq r,e \leq
    10^{6}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq c \leq
    10^{6}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line for each test case: “<tt class="ttfamily">advertise</tt>”, “<tt class="ttfamily">do not
    advertise</tt>” or “<tt class="ttfamily">does not matter</tt>”,
    indicating whether it is most profitable to advertise or not,
    or whether it does not make any difference.</p>
