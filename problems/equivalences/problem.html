<div class="problembody">
<p>Consider the following exercise, found in a generic linear
    algebra textbook.</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
      Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> be an
      <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \times n$</span> matrix.
      Prove that the following statements are equivalent:

      <ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> is
          invertible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$Ax = b$</span> has
          exactly one solution for every <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \times 1$</span> matrix <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$Ax = b$</span> is
          consistent for every <span class="tex2jax_process">$n
          \times 1$</span> matrix <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$Ax = 0$</span> has only
          the trivial solution <span class="tex2jax_process">$x =
          0$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>The typical way to solve such an exercise is to show a
    series of implications. For instance, one can proceed by
    showing that (a) implies (b), that (b) implies (c), that (c)
    implies (d), and finally that (d) implies (a). These four
    implications show that the four statements are equivalent.</p>
<p>Another way would be to show that (a) is equivalent to (b)
    (by proving that (a) implies (b) and that (b) implies (a)),
    that (b) is equivalent to (c), and that (c) is equivalent to
    (d). However, this way requires proving six implications, which
    is clearly a lot more work than just proving four
    implications!</p>
<p>I have been given some similar tasks, and have already
    started proving some implications. Now I wonder, how many more
    implications do I have to prove? Can you help me determine
    this?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of
    testcases, at most 100. After that per testcase:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 20\, 000$</span>) and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0 \le m \le 50\, 000)$</span>: the
        number of statements and the number of implications that
        have already been proved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines with two
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le s_1,s_2\le n$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1 \ne s_2$</span>) each,
        indicating that it has been proved that statement
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1$</span> implies
        statement <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_2$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per testcase:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with the minimum number of additional
        implications that need to be proved in order to prove that
        all statements are equivalent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
