<p>Adrian, Bruno and Goran wanted to join the bird lovers’
    club. However, they did not know that all applicants must pass
    an entrance exam. The exam consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> questions, each with three
    possible answers: A, B and C.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, they couldn’t tell a bird from a whale so
    they are trying to guess the correct answers. Each of the three
    boys has a theory of what set of answers will work best:</p>
<p>Adrian claims that the best sequence is: A, B, C, A, B, C,
    A, B, C, A, B, C ...</p>
<p>Bruno is convinced that this is better: B, A, B, C, B, A, B,
    C, B, A, B, C ...</p>
<p>Goran laughs at them and will use this sequence: C, C, A, A,
    B, B, C, C, A, A, B, B ...</p>
<p>Write a program that, given the correct answers to the exam,
    determines who of the three was right – <b class="bfseries">whose sequence contains the most correct
    answers</b>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 100$</span>), the number of questions on the
    exam.</p>
<p>The second line contains a string of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> letters ‘A’, ‘B’ and ‘C’. These
    are, in order, the correct answers to the questions in the
    exam.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>On the first line, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, the largest number of correct
    answers one of the three boys gets.</p>
<p>After that, output the names of the boys (in alphabetical
    order) whose sequences result in <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> correct answers.</p>
