<div class="problembody">
<p>Ola Clason’s Hardware store is an old company where most
    work is done “the old way”. Among other things, the company is
    the one and only provider of marble house numbers. These house
    numbers have become extremely popular among construction
    companies, especially the ones building luxury estates. This is
    of course great for Ola Clason, but also a small problem.
    Nisse, who has been managing the incoming orders has turned out
    to be a bottleneck in Ola’s business. Most orders are on the
    form “Coconut Drive 200, 202, 204, ..., 220”. This means every
    even number between <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$220$</span>. Nisse’s work is
    to transfer an order to a list of necessary digits and other
    symbols.</p>
<p>Your assignment is to write a program that automates Nisse’s
    work with orders containing only positive integer house
    numbers. Nisse will still in the future process all special
    orders (those including non digit symbols) by hand.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line of input is a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \le 10$</span>, specifying the
    number of orders that follow. The first line of each order
    contains the road name for that order. No road name is longer
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> characters. The
    second line states the total number of buildings needing new
    marble numbers on that order, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>.</p>
<p>Then follows the different house number specifications on
    several lines. These lines are of two kinds: single number
    lines and multiple number lines. A single number line simply
    consists of the house number by itself, while a multiple number
    line starts with a ‘<tt class="ttfamily">+</tt>’-sign, followed
    by three positive integer numbers: first number, last number
    and the interval between the house numbers. The last number
    will always be at least the first number, and the difference
    between the first and last house number will always be a
    multiple of the house number interval. House numbers are always
    positive and never have more than five digits. A house number
    may appear more than once in an order, in this case that house
    will get multiple signs.</p>
<p>After the last house number specification line, the next
    order follows, if there is any.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each order, the output consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span> lines. The first and second lines
    should be identical with the first two input lines. Then, there
    follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> lines with
    information on how many marble digits of each kind the order
    consists of. These rows are on the format “<tt class="ttfamily">Make <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> digit
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span></tt>” where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is how many copies of
    digit <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> they need to
    make. The last row states the total number <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z$</span> of digits needed, on the format
    “<tt class="ttfamily">In total <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z$</span> digits</tt>”. If there is only one
    digit to produce, it should say “<tt class="ttfamily">In total
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> digit</tt>”, in order
    to be grammatically correct.</p>
