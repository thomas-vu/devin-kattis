<p>Your favorite online game has a prize system. After each
    match you win, there is a <span class="tex2jax_process">$P\%
    $</span> chance you will receive a prize. This value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> changes over time:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>every time you lose a match, <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> increases by <span class="tex2jax_process">$\Delta _ L$</span>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>every time you win a match but fail to receive a prize,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> increases by
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$\Delta _ W$</span>, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>every time you win a match and receive a prize,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is set to
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is
    increased, it is capped at <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>. That is, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is to be increased by <span class="tex2jax_process">$\Delta $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> increases to <span class="tex2jax_process">$\min (P+\Delta , 100)$</span>.</p>
<p>The developers just revealed one of the prizes this season
    is a silverback gorilla suit with star-shaped sunglasses. You
    want it! Each prize has a <span class="tex2jax_process">$G\%
    $</span> chance of being this gorilla suit.</p>
<p>You start with <span class="tex2jax_process">$P = 0\%
    $</span>. You have an <span class="tex2jax_process">$L\%
    $</span> chance of losing each match you play. Given
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\Delta _ L, \Delta _ W,
    G,$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>,
    compute the expected number of matches you will have to play
    until you obtain the silverback gorilla suit.</p>
<p>For example, in the first sample case you win every match
    you play and are guaranteed to receive a prize every
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> matches. Each prize
    has a <span class="tex2jax_process">$50\% $</span> chance of
    being the gorilla suit. So you expect to obtain the gorilla
    suit after receiving <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    prizes. Thus, in expectation, it takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> matches to obtain the gorilla
    suit.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing four integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\Delta _ L$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq \Delta _ L \leq 100$</span>),
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\Delta _ W$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq \Delta _ W \leq 100$</span>),
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq G \leq 100$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq L \leq 99$</span>), which are described above.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the expected number of matches you will play before
    you obtain the gorilla suit. Your answer should have an
    absolute or relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
