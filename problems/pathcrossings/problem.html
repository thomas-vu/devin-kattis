<div class="problembody">
<p>Yraglac is the developer of a popular Android/iOS racing
    game that also happens to collect location data from its
    players all the time, even when the player is not using the
    app. He has now amassed a large database of the precise
    location <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> of
    players over time <span class="tex2jax_process">$(t)$</span>.
    We will refer to a triplet <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y,t)$</span> as a “ping”.</p>
<p>Now Yraglac wants to analyze this data to determine which
    players are likely to have met in person. He will probably sell
    this information and also use it to send targeted
    advertisements encouraging players to purchase a new co-op game
    mode add-on. Players are considered to have likely met if they
    have “crossed paths”, meaning that they were within
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> meter of each other
    within <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> seconds.
    Precisely, players A and B have crossed paths if there exists a
    ping <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ A,y_ A,t_ A)$</span>
    from player A and a ping <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_
    B,y_ B,t_ B)$</span> from player B such that the Euclidean
    distance from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ A,y_
    A)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ B,y_
    B)$</span> is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    meter and <span class="tex2jax_process">$|t_ A - t_ B| \leq 10
    \text { seconds}$</span>.</p>
<p>Can you help Yraglac find all players who crossed paths?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq P \leq 100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq
    N \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$</span>), the number of players and the
    total number of pings in Yraglac’s database. Next will follow
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines with one ping
    per line. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th line
    contains four integers of <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_
    i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p_ i \leq P$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1\, 000 \leq x_ i, y_ i \leq 1\,
    000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq t_ i \leq
    10^9$</span>). <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> is
    the player, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i, y_ i)$</span>
    is the location in millimeters (where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> millimeters = <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> meter), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> is the time in seconds. Pings
    may be given in any order. For a given player, there will not
    be two pings with the same time. Some players may not have any
    pings.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that there are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> pings in any <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>-second time window. That is, for
    any integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, there
    will be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> pings
    from any player with a time between <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t+10$</span> inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> which is the total number of
    distinct player pairs who cross paths at least once. Note that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C=0$</span> is possible. Then
    output <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> lines, where
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th line contains
    two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a_ i, b_ i \leq P$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i &lt; b_ i$</span>),
    identifying a player pair who crossed paths. The player pairs
    must be output in ascending order of <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>, and if two pairs have the same
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>, then ascending
    order of <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span>.</p>
