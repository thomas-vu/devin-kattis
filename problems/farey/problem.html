<div class="problembody">
<p>Given a positive integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the sequence of all fractions
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a / b$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le a \le b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le b \le N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> relatively prime, listed in
    increasing order, is called the <i class="itshape">Farey
    Sequence</i> of order <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.
    For example, the <i class="itshape">Farey Sequence</i> of order
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> is:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 0/1, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 1/3, 2/5, 1/2, 3/5,
    2/3, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 1/1 \]</span>
<p>For this problem, you will write a program to compute the
    length of the <i class="itshape">Farey Sequence</i> of order
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 10\, 000$</span>), which is the
    number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be
    processed identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by the order
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le N \le 10\, 000$</span>) of the
    <i class="itshape">Farey Sequence</i> whose length is to be
    found.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is a single line of output. The
    single output line consists of the data set number,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single
    space followed by the length of the <i class="itshape">Farey
    Sequence</i> as a decimal integer.</p>
