<p>Some viruses replicate by replacing a piece of DNA in a
    living cell with a piece of DNA that the virus carries with it.
    This makes the cell start to produce viruses identical to the
    original one that infected the cell. A group of biologists is
    interested in knowing how much DNA a certain virus inserts into
    the host genome. To find this out they have sequenced the full
    genome of a healthy cell as well as that of an identical cell
    infected by a virus.</p>
<p>The genome turned out to be pretty big, so now they need
    your help in the data processing step. Given the DNA sequence
    before and after the virus infection, determine the length of
    the smallest single, consecutive piece of DNA that can have
    been inserted into the first sequence to turn it into the
    second one. A single, consecutive piece of DNA might also have
    been removed from the same position in the sequence as DNA was
    inserted. Small changes in the DNA can have large effects, so
    the virus might insert only a few bases, or even nothing at
    all.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two lines containing the DNA sequence
    before and after virus infection respectively. A DNA sequence
    is given as a string containing between 1 and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^5$</span> upper-case letters from the
    alphabet {A, G, C, T}.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one integer, the minimum length of DNA inserted by
    the virus.</p>
