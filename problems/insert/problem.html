<p>All modern banks employ information systems to process their
    data. The amount of data is enormous. Imagine all the
    transactions, payments, e-banking, web services, etc.
    Therefore, advanced data structures must be used to store the
    data and allow to access them very quickly.</p>
<p>A Binary Search Tree (BST) is one example of such a data
    structure It holds a collection of values with some comparison
    operation that provides linear ordering on these values.</p>
<p>BST consists of nodes, each of them contains one value and
    has at most two subnodes: left and right (BST is a binary
    tree). The left subtree always contains only values strictly
    less than the node value, the right subtree only values greater
    than or equal to the node value.</p>
<p>As a consequence, values may easily be looked up by
    traversing the tree recursively. We begin with the root node
    and compare its value with the value we are searching for.
    Depending on the result, we descend either into the left or
    into the right subtree, but we never need to walk through
    both.</p>
<p>If we want to insert values to an existing tree, the
    procedure is also simple. The first value (when the tree is
    empty) is always put as the root. If the tree already exists,
    we start with the root node and traverse the tree recursively,
    as in the case of searching. When the traversal leads us to a
    missing subnode, we create a new leaf node at that position and
    assign it the new value.</p>
<p>The figures below show the tree after subsequently adding
    the following sequence of numbers: 3, 4, 3, 5, 4, 1, and 2.</p>

<p>You may notice that different permutations of the same
    numbers will often result in the same BST. For example, the
    tree from the fifth figure above may be constructed by three
    different input sequences:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>3, 4, 3, 5, 4</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3, 4, 5, 4, 3</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3, 4, 5, 3, 4</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Interesting, isnâ€™t it? Your task is to compute how many
    different permutations are there that will result into the same
    BST.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will consist of several trees, each of them
    specified on two lines. The first line contains a single
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 100$</span>), the number of
    values in the tree. The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> values separated by a space. These
    values, if inserted in the given order, form a BST to be
    examined. All values will be between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>.</p>
<p>The last tree is followed by a line containing a single
    zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each tree, output the total number of different
    permutations that would generate the same Binary Search Tree.
    As you may notice in the Sample Output, this number may exceed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{32}$</span>.</p>
