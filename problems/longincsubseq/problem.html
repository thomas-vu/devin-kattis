<div class="problembody">
<p>We say that an integer sequence is <em>increasing</em> if
    the numbers in the sequence increase (rather than decrease or
    stay the same). For example, the following is an increasing
    sequence of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ (15, 27, 39, 56, 60, 80, 96) \]</span>
<p>A <em>subsequence</em> of a sequence uses some of the same
    members, in the same order, but may leave some out. For
    example, if we have the following (non-increasing) sequence of
    length <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    (3, 11, 53, 21, 41, 61, 23) \]</span>
<p>then <span class="tex2jax_process">$(11, 53, 61)$</span> is
    a subsequence of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. And this subsequence also happens
    to be increasing. However, for this example there are longer
    increasing subsequences; what is the longest you can find?</p>
<p>Write a program that, given a sequence of integers, finds a
    subsequence that is increasing and is as long as possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$64$</span> test cases. Each test case has
    two lines. The first line has a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \le 100\, 000$</span>, indicating the
    length of a sequence. Then follows a line containing a sequence
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers, each in
    the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-2^{31},
    2^{31})$</span>. Input ends at end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing the length of a
    longest increasing subsequence, followed by a line containing
    the indices of the elements in one such sequence (the first
    element has index <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, the
    second index <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and so
    on). The indices should be given in ascending order. If
    multiple increasing subsequences have maximal length, report
    any one of them.</p>
