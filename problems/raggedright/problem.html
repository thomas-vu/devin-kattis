<p>Word wrapping is the task of deciding how to break a
    paragraph of text into lines. For aesthetic reasons, we’d like
    all the lines except the last one to be about the same length.
    For example, we would say the text on the left looks less
    ragged than the text on the right:</p>
<pre>
            This is a                 This
            paragraph                 is a paragraph
            of text.                  of text.
</pre>
<p>Your job is to compute a raggedness value for an arbitrary
    paragraph of text. We’ll measure raggedness in a way similar to
    the T<sub style="text-transform:uppercase; margin-left:-0.2em">e</sub>X 
    typesetting system. Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> be the length, measured in
    characters, of the longest line of the paragraph. If some other
    line contains only <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    characters, then we’ll charge a penalty score of <span class="tex2jax_process">$( n - m )^2$</span> for that line. The
    raggedness will be the sum of the penalty scores for every line
    except the last one.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single paragraph of text containing at
    most 100 lines. Each line of the paragraph contains a sequence
    of between 1 and 80 characters (letters, punctuation
    characters, decimal digits and spaces). No line starts or ends
    with spaces. The paragraph ends at end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print out a single integer, the raggedness score for
    paragraph.</p>
