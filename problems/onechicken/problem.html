<p>Dr. Chaz is hosting a programming contest wrap up dinner.
    Dr. Chaz has severe OCD and is very strict on rules during
    dinner, specifically, he needs to be sure that everyone take
    <em>exactly</em> <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> piece
    of chicken at his buffet, even if that will result in an
    enormous amount of leftovers. This is why every year before the
    dinner, Dr. Chaz would give a powerful speech: “Everyone,
    <em>one chicken per person!</em>”</p>
<p>However, Dr. Chaz does not always have an idea how many
    pieces of chicken he needs, he believes if there are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> people at the buffet
    and everyone takes exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> piece of chicken, providing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> pieces of chicken will
    be perfect, i.e., is enough and will have no leftovers. Help
    Dr. Chaz find out whether his decision is good or not!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contain integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq N\leq 1\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq M\leq 1\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N\neq M$</span> , the number of people at
    the buffet and the number of pieces of chicken Dr. Chaz is
    providing.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line of the form “Dr. Chaz will have
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> piece[s] of chicken
    left over!”, if Dr. Chaz has enough chicken and <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> pieces of chicken will be left
    over, or “Dr. Chaz needs <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> more piece[s] of chicken!” if Dr.
    Chaz does not have enough pieces of chicken and needs
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> more.</p>
