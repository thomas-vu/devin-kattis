<p>A province to our west, which shall remain nameless, but
    whose name does not start with A, B, or S, has a unique system
    for driverâ€™s license demerit and merit points. The system works
    (more or less) as follows.</p>
<p>A new driver starts with no merit or demerit points. When
    the driver is convicted of a driving offense, he or she is
    given between <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> demerit points,
    depending on the severity of the offense.</p>
<p>A merit point is given, to a maximum of five, for each
    interval of two years in which a driver has no offenses and no
    demerit points. Each merit point cancels up to two demerit
    points. If a subsequent offense occurs and the number of
    demerit points exceeds double the number of merit points, the
    number of demerit points is reduced by double the number of
    merit points, and the number of merit points is set to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. If a subsequent
    offense occurs and the number of demerit points is less than or
    equal to double the number of merit points, the number of
    demerit points is reduced to <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, and the number of merit points is
    reduced by half the number of demerit points. Any fractional
    merit points are discarded.</p>
<p>Demerit points are reduced whenever a driver has one year
    free of any driving offense. This reduction decreases the
    number of demerits by half or by <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, whichever is more. Any fractional
    or negative demerit points are discarded. This reduction takes
    place on each anniversary of the most recent offense until no
    points remain.</p>
<p>If a new offense occurs on the same day as a demerit point
    reduction or merit point award, the reduction/award is done
    before the new demerit points are given.</p>
<p>Your job is to read a set of information records for a
    driver, and to print the number of merit or demerit points at
    any given time.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the date of issue of the
    license (in YYYYMMDD format). Subsequent lines contain
    information on up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>
    offenses, in chronological order. Each such line contains the
    offense date (in YYYYMMDD format) and the number of points
    applied (an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span>).</p>
<p>You may assume that the dates in the input are valid, that
    the year is at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1900$</span> at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2999$</span>, and that no input date is a
    leap day (Feb <span class="tex2jax_process">$29$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For the day the license is issued, and for every occasion
    that the number of merit or demerit points changes, output a
    line giving the date and the number of points, in the format
    below. Output terminates when <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> merit points are accumulated
    following the last offense.</p>
