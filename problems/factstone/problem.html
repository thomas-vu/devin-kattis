</div>Amtel has announced that it will release a 128-bit
    computer chip by 2010, a 256-bit computer by 2020, and so on,
    continuing its strategy of doubling the word-size every ten
    years. (Amtel released a 64-bit computer in 2000, a 32-bit
    computer in 1990, a 16-bit computer in 1980, an 8-bit computer
    in 1970, and a 4-bit computer, its first, in 1960.)

    <p>Amtel will use a new benchmark – the Factstone – to
    advertise the vastly improved capacity of its new chips. The
    Factstone rating is defined to be the largest integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$n!$</span> can be represented as an unsigned
    integer in a computer word.</p>
<p>Given a year <span class="tex2jax_process">$1960 \le y \le
    2160$</span>, what will be the Factstone rating of Amtel’s most
    recently released chip?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There are several test cases. For each test case, there is
    one line of input containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>. A line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> follows the last test case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line giving the Factstone
    rating.</p>
