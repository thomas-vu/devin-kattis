</div>At one of the many climate protests, Skylar fell in love
    with a fellow environmental activist. Unfortunately, the two
    young lovers live on opposite sides of the planet and long
    distance travel is only practical by (<i class="itshape">gasp</i>) air. Skylar had scolded friends and family
    for flying, heavily handing out the recent Swedish export
    <i class="itshape">flygskam</i> (verbatim translation: flight
    shame). But alas, the things we do for love! Now they want your
    help to calculate the minimum amount of <em>flygskam</em>
    Skylar will accumulate on a one-way trip across the globe.
    <p>To calculate the best route you models the planet as a
    perfect sphere and assumes that all flights fly at the distance
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6381$</span> km from the center
    of the earth. The amount of shame for a single point-to-point
    flight is calculated as the distance between the airports in
    km, plus a take-off and landing penalty of <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, that is, two airports with the
    flight distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span> km
    will result in <span class="tex2jax_process">$1100$</span>
    shame.</p>
<h2>Latitude and longitude</h2>
<p>The positions of the airports are given as the latitude and
    longitude in (decimal) degrees. The latitude of a point
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> on the earths surface
    is the angle between the equatorial plane and a line passing
    through <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> and the center
    of the earth. The equator has latitude <span class="tex2jax_process">$0^\circ $</span>, points north of the
    equator has positive values and points south of the equator has
    negative values, the North Pole has latitude <span class="tex2jax_process">$90^\circ $</span> and the South Pole
    latitude <span class="tex2jax_process">$-90 ^\circ $</span>.
    Half circles that run from the North to the South pole are
    called <i class="itshape">meridians</i>. The zero meridian runs
    through Greenwich. The longitude of a point <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> is the angle between the zero
    meridian plane and the line that run through <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> and the center of the earth, with
    values from <span class="tex2jax_process">$- 180^\circ $</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$+180^\circ $</span>, with
    positive values east of Greenwich.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with one line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10\, 000$</span>, the number
    of airports and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq
    100\, 000$</span>, the number of two-way flight routes. The
    second line has two strings <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, Skylar’s start position and
    Skylar’s target position. Then follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, each starts with a three
    letter (uppercase) airport code, followed by two real values
    numbers, the latitude and longitude in degrees. Then follows
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines, each with two
    strings <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, the airports with a
    two-way flight connection.</p>
<p>All flight airports have unique names and all connections
    are between existing airports.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a real value with the minimum amount of <i class="itshape">flygskam</i> Skylar will obtain on a one-way trip. If
    the target is unreachable and Skylar will be forever alone,
    output -1. Answers within a relative or absolute error of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> will be
    accepted.</p>
