<p>A Parisian entrepreneur has just opened a new restaurant
    “Au bon cordon bleu”, named after a famous
    French recipe. However, no one has any idea of which wine would
    be appropriate with such a dish. The entrepreneur plans to
    sample many different wines in order to build the wine
    menu.</p>
<p>The various bottles of wine he plans to taste can be
    obtained from different wine merchants located in or around
    Paris. Being a very sensitive product, high-quality wine can
    only be transported by highly trained couriers on motorbikes.
    Therefore, those couriers are very expensive.</p>
<p>A courier can be used for the transportation of several wine
    bottles, but can transport only one bottle at a time. All
    couriers get paid at the same fixed rate: one euro per
    kilometer. The distance function used is the Manhattan distance
    (also known as taxicab metric) of every individual segment of
    the trip: the distance from a point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1)$</span> to a point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2, y_2)$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$|x_1-x_2|+|y_1-y_2|$</span>.</p>
<p>A courier in charge of transporting a single wine bottle
    will get paid as many euros as the sum of the following two
    (Manhattan) distances: from her base to the wine merchant
    place, and from the wine merchant place to the restaurant.</p>
<p>Consider a more complex example: a courier in charge of
    transporting two wine bottles, one after the other. The amount
    paid will be the sum of the following distances: from his base
    to the location of the first bottle, then to the restaurant,
    then to the location of the second bottle, then to the
    restaurant.</p>
<p>Help the entrepreneur minimize the costs of hiring the
    couriers. Given a set of Cartesian coordinates corresponding to
    available couriers, a set of Cartesian coordinates
    corresponding to the locations of the precious wine bottles
    they need to collect, and the location of the restaurant,
    compute the smallest number of kilometers that the couriers
    will be paid for. There is no obligation to use all available
    couriers, and bottles can be collected in an arbitrary
    order.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The input comprises several lines, each consisting of
    integers separated with single spaces:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line consists of the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> of wine bottles to collect and
        the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> of
        available couriers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> following
        lines consist of the coordinates of each bottle as two
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> following
        lines consist of the coordinates of each courier’s base as
        two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last line contains the coordinates of the restaurant
        as two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limits</h3>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 1\,
        000$</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq 1\,
        000$</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> verify <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1\, 000 \leq x \leq 1\, 000$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1\, 000 \leq y \leq 1\,
        000$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>A single integer: the smallest number of euros that needs to
    be paid to collect all bottles.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>There might be more than one item at the same initial
    location. For example, it would be possible for two bottles,
    ten couriers, and the restaurant to share the same starting
    position.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>

<p>On this example, only one courier (<span class="tex2jax_process">$C_2$</span>) is used to retrieve the two
    bottles <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_2$</span>, and bring them to
    the restaurant <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> by
    performing the moves labeled <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> in succession. The total number of
    kilometers is <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>. This is
    one of the optimal solutions.</p>
