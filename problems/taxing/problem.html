<div class="problembody">
<p>George has won the lottery and, being a nice guy, has
    decided to spread the wealth around. However, monetary gifts
    can be taxed once they get over a certain sizeâ€”the amount of
    tax depends on how much his friends have earned that year.</p>
<p>The amount of tax paid depends on tax bands. The bands start
    at zero. Each one takes a certain cut of income from the range
    of pre-tax income it covers. The final tax band applies to all
    income above its lower bound.</p>
<p>George is a savvy fellow and knows the number of tax bands,
    the amount of money each friend has earned and the amount he
    wants each friend to walk away with.</p>
<p>How much should George give to each friend before tax?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le B \le 20$</span>): the number of
        tax bands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> further lines,
        each containing two real numbers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; s_ i \le 10^6$</span>): the size
        in pounds of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> tax band, and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le p_ i \le 100$</span>): the
        percentage taxation for that band.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing a real number <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le P \le 99.999$</span>): the
        percentage tax on all income above other bands.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; F \le 20$</span>): the number of
        friends George wants to pay.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> further lines,
        each containing two real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$e_ j$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_ j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le e_ j \le 10^6$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; m_ j \le
        10^6$</span>): the amount of money the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{th}$</span> friend has earned, and
        the amount of money they should receive after tax
        respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Tax bands will be given in increasing order. All real
    numbers have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>
    decimals after the decimal point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> lines, one for
        each friend specified in the input and in the same
        order.</p>
<p>Each line should contain one real number: the amount of
        money George will give to his friend, in order to arrive at
        the correct amount after they have paid tax.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All output must be accurate to an absolute or relative error
    of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
