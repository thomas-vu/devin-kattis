<p>Ante bought a piece of land. The land contains N apple
    trees, but his piece is triangular and it is not easy for him
    to determine which apple trees belong to him.</p>
<p>Your program will be given the coordinates of the vertices
    of the triangle forming Anteâ€™s piece, and the coordinates of
    all apple trees. Determine the area of land belonging to Ante,
    and the number of trees belonging to him. We consider apple
    trees on the very border of his piece to belong to him.</p>
<p>The area of a triangle with vertices <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ A, y_ A), (x_ B, y_ B)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ C, y_ C)$</span> is given by
    the following formula:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    \frac{|x_ A(y_ B - y_ C) + x_ B(y_ C - y_ A) + x_ C(y_ A - y_
    B)|}{2} \]</span>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first three lines contain the coordinates of the
    vertices of the triangle.</p>
<p>The following line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \le N \le 100)$</span>, the number of apple trees.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains the coordinates of
    one apple tree.</p>
<p>All coordinate are pairs of positive integers less than
    1000, separated by a space.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the area of land belonging to Ante on the first line,
    with exactly one digit after the decimal point.</p>
<p>Output the number of trees belonging to Ante on the second
    line.</p>
