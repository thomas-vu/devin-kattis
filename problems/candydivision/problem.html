<div class="problembody">
<p>Benny has just found out that he has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> candies in his pocket. He is
    always happy to share candies with his friends, because then he
    doesn’t have to eat them alone and get fat. There is one
    problem, though. He cannot invite any number of friends, since
    it would be impossible to divide candies evenly among
    people.</p>
<p>Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, how many
    people can Benny invite to eat candies, so that everybody gets
    the same number of candies and all candies will be eaten?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains one line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq N\leq 10^{12}$</span>), denoting the
    number of candies in Benny’s pocket.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with all possible number of friends Benny
    can invite. Output them in ascending order and separate by
    spaces.</p>
