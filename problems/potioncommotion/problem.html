<div class="problembody">
<p>You are incredibly close to becoming the Pokemon champion,
    but one final obstacle stands in your way: the Elite Four.
    Throughout your journey, you raised your starter Pokemon to a
    high enough level, and out of a show of loyalty to your
    favorite Pokemon, you vowed to never catch another Pokemon.
    This would normally put you at a disadvantage against the
    toughest trainers in the region, but you know from experience
    that with enough healing items and preparation, it is possible
    to power through any fight.</p>
<p>You begin your preparations by running a few calculations.
    Your only Pokemon has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    health initially and will faint if its health ever drops to
    zero or below. You know that throughout the Elite 4 battles,
    your Pokemon will be attacked <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> times by opposing trainers, each
    attack potentially dealing a different amount of damage. With
    this in mind, you head straight to the Pokemart and stock up on
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> potions that heal
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> health each.</p>
<p>After each time your Pokemon is attacked, you are allowed to
    use as many potions as you want (until you run out of potions)
    to heal your Pokemon, although your Pokemon’s health can never
    increase above <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. If
    your Pokemon’s health ever drops to zero or below, it faints
    and you lose the battle. Given the amount of damage each attack
    from the opposing Pokemon does, determine if you can make it
    through the Elite Four without your Pokemon fainting.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>. These represent your Pokemon’s
    health (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 100\,
    000$</span>), the number of attacks by opposing Pokemon
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq 1\, 000$</span>),
    and the number of potions you have (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq P \leq 100\, 000$</span>).</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_1, \ldots , d_ M$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d_ i \leq 100\,
    000$</span>) representing the amount of damage dealt by each
    attack, in order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing <tt>champion</tt> if your Pokemon
    can survive every attack or <tt>next time</tt> if not.</p>
