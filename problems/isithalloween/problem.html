<p>HiQ recently got an assignment from a client to create a
    clone of the immensely popular website <a href="https://IsItHalloween.com">https://IsItHalloween.com</a>. The
    website is a very simple one. People will visit the site
    occasionally to see if it is Halloween. Whenever it is, the
    website should print out <tt class="ttfamily">yup</tt>,
    otherwise it should print out <tt class="ttfamily">nope</tt> on
    the screen.</p>
<p>Since HiQ is such a popular firm, they don’t have time to
    complete this assignment right now. Their frontend engineers
    have already programmed the frontend of the website that prints
    out <tt class="ttfamily">yup</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">nope</tt>, but not the backend microservice that
    determines whether it is indeed Halloween or not. Do you have
    time to help them?</p>
<p>The behaviour of the server should be as follows: it gets as
    input the current date in the format <tt class="ttfamily">FEB
    9</tt>, where <tt class="ttfamily">FEB</tt> is the month given
    in three letters (<tt class="ttfamily">JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY,
    JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV, DEC</tt>) and <tt class="ttfamily">9</tt> is the day of the month starting at 1. It
    should then determine if this date represents October 31 or
    December 25 (since <span class="tex2jax_process">$31_8 =
    25_{10}$</span>).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing a date of the
    format <tt class="ttfamily">FEB 9</tt>, with the month and date
    separated by a single space.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the date is October 31 or December 25, output <tt class="ttfamily">yup</tt>. Otherwise, output <tt class="ttfamily">nope</tt>.</p>
