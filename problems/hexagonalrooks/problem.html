<p>It is game night and Alice and Bob are playing chess. After
    beating Bob at chess several times, Alice suggests they should
    play a chess variant instead called <em>hexagonal chess</em>.
    Although the game is very rarely played nowadays, Alice knows
    the rules very well and has obtained a hexagonal chessboard
    from her subscription to the magazine of Bizarre Artifacts for
    Playing Chess.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: The field naming of the hexagonal chess
          board and the directions in which a rook can move.
        </div>

</div>
<p>The hexagonal chess board, shown above, consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$91$</span> hexagonal cells
    arranged in the shape of a hexagon with side length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> as depicted in the
    above diagrams. The board is divided into <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span> columns, each called a file, and
    the files are labeled <tt class="ttfamily">a</tt> to <tt class="ttfamily">k</tt> from left to right. It is also divided into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span> v-shaped rows, each
    called a rank, which are labeled <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt> to
    <tt class="ttfamily">11</tt> from bottom to top. The unique
    cell in file <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and rank
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> is then denoted by the
    coordinate <span class="tex2jax_process">$xy$</span>. For
    example, rank <tt class="ttfamily">11</tt> contains only a
    single cell <tt class="ttfamily">f11</tt> and rank <tt class="ttfamily">7</tt> is occupied entirely by the black playerâ€™s
    pawns.</p>
<p>Alice begins by explaining how all the pieces move. The
    simplest piece is the rook, which can move an arbitrary
    positive number of steps in a straight line in the direction of
    any of its <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> adjacent
    cells, as depicted in the figure on the right. Bob immediately
    realises that the hexagonal rook already is more difficult to
    work with than its regular chess counterpart.</p>
<p>In order to attack one of the opponents pieces, it is useful
    to know which cells his rook can move to such that it attacks
    the opposing piece. The more of these cells there are, the more
    valuable the current position of his rook is. However,
    calculating this number is too much for Bob. After losing so
    many games of regular chess, Alice allows Bob to use a program
    to assist in his rook placement. While Alice explains the rest
    of the game you get busy coding.</p>
<p>As a small simplification, Bob will compute the number of
    ways his rook can move to the destination cell assuming there
    are no other pieces on the board, not even the piece he wants
    to attack.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The input consists of one line, containing two different
        coordinates on the hexagonal chess board, the current
        positions of your rook and the piece you want to
        attack.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the number of ways the rook can
    move from its current position to the position of the piece it
    wants to attack in exactly two moves, assuming there are no
    other pieces on the board.</p>
