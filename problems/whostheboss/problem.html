<p>Several surveys indicate that the taller you are, the higher
    you can climb the corporate ladder. At TALL Enterprises Inc.,
    this “de facto standard” has been properly formalized: your
    boss is always at least as tall as you are. Furthermore, you
    can safely assume that your boss earns a bit more than you do.
    In fact, you can be absolutely sure that your immediate boss is
    the person who earns the least among all the employees that
    earn more than you and are at least as tall as you are.
    Furthermore, if you are the immediate boss of someone, that
    person is your subordinate, and all of his or her subordinates
    are your subordinates as well. If you are nobody’s boss, then
    you have no subordinates. As simple as these rules are, many
    people working for TALL are unsure of to whom they should be
    turning in their weekly progress report and how many
    subordinates they have. Write a program that will help in
    determining for any employee who the immediate boss of that
    employee is and how many subordinates they have. Quality
    Assurance at TALL have devised a series of tests to ensure that
    your program is correct. These test are described below.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line of input are two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>) is the number of
    employees and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> (at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>) is the number
    of queries. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each list an employee by
    three integers on the same line: employee ID number (six
    decimal digits, the first one of which is not zero), yearly
    salary in Euros and finally height in <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mu $</span>m (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \mu \text {m} = 10^{-6}$</span> meters –
    accuracy is important at TALL). The chairperson is the employee
    that earns more than anyone else and is also the tallest person
    in the company. Then there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines listing queries. Each query
    is a single legal employee ID.</p>
<p>The salary is a positive integer which is at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000\, 000$</span>. No two
    employees have the same ID, and no two employees have the same
    salary. The height of an employee is at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mu $</span>m and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 500\, 000$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mu $</span>m.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each employee ID <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> in a query output a single line
    with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> is the ID of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>’s boss, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is the number of subordinates of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>. If the query is the
    ID of the chairperson, then you should output <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> as the ID of his or her boss
    (since the chairperson has no immediate boss except, possibly,
    God).</p>
