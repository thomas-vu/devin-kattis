<p>Wherever there is large-scale construction, you will find
    cranes that do the lifting. One hardly ever thinks about what
    marvelous examples of engineering cranes are: a structure of
    (relatively) little weight that can lift much heavier loads.
    But even the best-built cranes may have a limit on how much
    weight they can lift.</p>
<p>The Association of Crane Manufacturers (ACM) needs a program
    to compute the range of weights that a crane can lift. Since
    cranes are symmetric, ACM engineers have decided to consider
    only a cross section of each crane, which can be viewed as a
    polygon resting on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: Crane cross section
        </div>
</center>
</div>
<p>Figure 1 shows a cross section of the crane in the first
    sample input. Assume that every <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \times 1$</span> unit of crane cross
    section weighs 1 kilogram and that the weight to be lifted will
    be attached at one of the polygon vertices (indicated by the
    arrow in Figure 1). Write a program that determines the weight
    range for which the crane will not topple to the left or to the
    right.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The test case
    starts with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \le n \le 100$</span>), the number of points of the polygon
    used to describe the craneâ€™s shape. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> pairs of integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i, y_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-2\, 000 \le x_ i \le 2\, 000, 0 \le y_ i
    \le 2\, 000$</span>) are the coordinates of the polygon points
    in order. The weight is attached at the first polygon point and
    at least two polygon points are lying on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the weight range (in kilograms) that can be attached
    to the crane without the crane toppling over. If the range is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[a,b]$</span>, display
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lfloor a \rfloor $</span>
<tt class="tt">..</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lceil b
    \rceil $</span>. For example, if the range is <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1.5,13.3]$</span>, display <tt class="tt">1</tt> <tt class="tt">..</tt> <tt class="tt">14</tt>. If
    the range is <span class="tex2jax_process">$[a,\infty
    )$</span>, display <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lfloor a
    \rfloor $</span> <tt class="tt">..</tt> <tt class="tt">inf</tt>. If the crane cannot carry any weight, display
    <tt class="tt">unstable</tt> instead.</p>
