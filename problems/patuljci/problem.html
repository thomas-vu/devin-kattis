<p>Every day, while the dwarves are busy in the mines, Snow
    White prepares dinner for them; seven chairs, seven plates,
    seven forks and seven knives for seven hungry dwarves.</p>
<p>One day nine dwarves came from the mines instead of seven
    (nobody knows how or why), each of them claiming to be one of
    Snow White’s seven dwarves.</p>
<p>Luckily, each dwarf wears a hat with a positive integer less
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> written on it.
    Snow White, a famous mathematician, realised long ago that the
    sum of numbers on the hats of her seven dwarves was exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>.</p>
<p>Write a program which determines which dwarves are legit,
    i.e., pick seven of nine numbers that add to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> lines of
    input. Each contains an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$99$</span> (inclusive). All of the numbers
    will be distinct.</p>
<p>The test data will be such that there exists a unique
    solution.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Your program must produce exactly seven lines of output –
    the numbers on the hats of Snow White’s seven dwarves. Output
    the numbers in the same order they are given in the input.</p>
