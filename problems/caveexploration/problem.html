<div class="problembody">
<p>Alice is a soccer coach who occasionally bring her soccer
    team to explore Caveland (that can be modeled as an undirected
    unweighted connected graph) for special event, e.g. for
    initiation ceremony, to celebrate birthdays, etc. Caveland has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> junctions and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> tunnels.</p>
<p>Caveland is quite prone to flooding, but that does not stop
    Alice and her soccer team from doing what they enjoy. You are
    Bob, Alice’s good friend. You want to ensure Alice and her
    soccer team are as safe as possible by letting her know which
    junction(s) is/are safe(r) than the rest. You decide that a
    junction <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> is considered
    to be safe(r) if <b class="bfseries">any one tunnel</b> is
    flooded, Alice and her soccer team can still go out from
    junction <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> to the
    entrance of Caveland (which is always junction <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>) via a non-flooded path.</p>

</center>
<p>For this example, junctions <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 0, 1, 2, 3\} $</span> are considered
    safe(r). If tunnel <span class="tex2jax_process">$0–2$</span>
    is flooded for example, Alice and her soccer team can detour
    via path <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \rightarrow 3
    \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 0$</span> to reach Caveland entrance.
    However junctions <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 4, 5, 6, 7,
    8\} $</span> are quite dangerous. If tunnel <span class="tex2jax_process">$2–8$</span> (or tunnel <span class="tex2jax_process">$3–4$</span>) is flooded, Alice and her
    soccer team will be trapped (cannot reach safety/junction
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>. (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 10\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq M \leq min(N(N-1)/2, 100\, 000)$</span>). The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> pairs of integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> that describe <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>-based indices of the two junctions
    that are connected with a tunnel in Caveland (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq u, v &lt; N$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$u \neq v$</span>). No two junctions are
    directly connected with more than one tunnel. You are
    guaranteed that junction <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> can reach all the other
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> junctions (if there
    is no flood).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print an integer in one line: The total number of
    junction(s) in Caveland that is/are safe(r) for Alice and her
    soccer team to explore. The actual junction numbers are not
    needed.</p>
