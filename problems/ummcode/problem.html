<p>The current programming club president, Norbit, gives
    speeches at the weekly club meetings. Casual viewers are
    underwhelmed with the quality of Norbit’s elocution.
    Specifically, Norbit often hesitates during his speeches with
    interjections like “umm.”</p>
<p>You, however, are no casual viewer–you are a computer
    scientist! You have noticed strange patterns in Norbit’s
    speech. Norbit’s interjections, when arranged together, form a
    binary code! By substituting <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>’s and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>’s for u’s and m’s, respectively,
    you produce 7-bit binary ASCII codes that spell out secret
    messages.</p>
<p>For example, the letter ‘a’ has an ASCII code of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$97$</span>, which translates to
    a binary value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1100001$</span> and an umm code of
    “uummmmu”. An umm code can be split up in the speech. For
    example, an encoding of ‘a’ could be stretched across three
    utterances: “uum”, “mmm”, “u” (possibly with other non-umm code
    words occurring between them).</p>
<p>Now that you have discovered Norbit’s secret, you go back
    through transcripts of his previous speeches to decode his
    cleverly concealed messages.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There is one line of input of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$20
    \le S \le 500\, 000$</span>), which ends with a single newline.
    Before the newline, the input may contain any characters in the
    ASCII range <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span> –
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$126$</span> (that is, space (‘
    ’) through tilde (‘<tt class="ttfamily">~</tt>’)).</p>
<p>Let’s define a “word” as a space-delimited sequence of
    characters. If a word does not contain any letters or digits
    except lowercase <tt class="ttfamily">u</tt>’s and/or
    <tt class="ttfamily">m</tt>’s, then it is part of the umm-coded
    message. If a word contains digits or letters other than
    lowercase <tt class="ttfamily">u</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">m</tt>, then it is not part of the umm-coded message
    (even if it does contain <tt class="ttfamily">u</tt> or
    <tt class="ttfamily">m</tt>). Note that a word that is part of
    the umm-coded message <em>may</em> contain punctuation (which
    is defined as anything other than letters, digits, or space).
    Naturally, you should only consider the <tt class="ttfamily">u</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">m</tt> characters
    (and not punctuation) when decoding the umm-coded message. Let
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> be the length of the
    entire umm-coded message (counting only its <tt class="ttfamily">u</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">m</tt> characters).
    It is guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$M \ge
    7$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> is
    evenly divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the de-umm-coded message. Note that for this problem,
    the judging is case-sensitive. It is guaranteed that each
    character that should be output is in the same ASCII range as
    the input.</p>
