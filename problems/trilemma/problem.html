<div class="problembody">
<p>You’re interested in writing a program to classify
    triangles. Triangles can be classified according to their
    internal angles. If one of the internal angles is exactly 90
    degrees, then that triangle is known as a "right" triangle. If
    one of the internal angles is greater than 90 degrees, that
    triangle is known as an "obtuse" triangle. Otherwise, all the
    internal angles are less than 90 degrees and the triangle is
    known as an "acute" triangle.</p>
<p>Triangles can also be classified according to the relative
    lengths of their sides. In a "scalene" triangle, all three
    sides have different lengths. In an "isosceles" triangle, two
    of the sides are of equal length. (If all three sides have the
    same length, the triangle is known as an "equilateral"
    triangle, but you can ignore this case since there will be no
    equilateral triangles in the input data.)</p>
<p>Your program must determine, for each set of three points,
    whether or not those points form a triangle. If the three
    points are not distinct, or the three points are collinear,
    then those points do not form a valid triangle. (Another way is
    to calculate the area of the triangle; valid triangles must
    have non-zero area.) Otherwise, your program will classify the
    triangle as one of "acute", "obtuse", or "right", and one of
    "isosceles" or "scalene".</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input gives the number of cases,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines follow, each containing
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1,y_1,x_2,y_2,x_3,y_3$</span>.</p>
<p>You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N
    \leq 100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1000 \leq
    x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, x_3, y_3 \leq 1000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing “<tt class="ttfamily">Case #<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>:</tt>” followed by one of these
    strings:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>“<tt>isosceles acute triangle</tt>”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<tt>isosceles obtuse triangle</tt>”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<tt>isosceles right triangle</tt>”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<tt>scalene acute triangle</tt>”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<tt>scalene obtuse triangle</tt>”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<tt>scalene right triangle</tt>”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>“<tt>not a triangle</tt>”</p>
</li>
</ul>
