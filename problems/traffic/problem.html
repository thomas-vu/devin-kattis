</div>It’s the slow crawl of rush hour. At any point of time,
    each vehicle is either stopped or is moving at the extremely
    slow speed of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> meter
    per second. Lately, vehicles come equipped with a simple “black
    box” that record all changes in a vehicle’s speed. In this
    problem, speeds change instantaneously.

    <p>The road is modelled as the real line (units in meters). So
    a car is identified with its position on the line. Also, cars
    are <span class="tex2jax_process">$4.4$</span> meters long.</p>
<p>Given initial positions of two cars that are driving along
    the real line in the positive direction and a transcript of
    their speed changes, did these cars ever collide? While such a
    collision would be very slow speed (a “bumper tap”), any
    collision could result in erroneous readings from the black box
    in the future so the portions of the transcripts after a
    collision might not make sense.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There is only one test case. The first line contains two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq X_1, X_2 \leq
    10^6$</span> indicating the initial positions of the rears of
    the two vehicles in meters. You are guaranteed either
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_1 + 5 \leq X_2$</span> or
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_2 + 5 \leq X_1$</span>.
    Initially (at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>),
    the two cars are stopped.</p>
<p>The second line begins with a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq N_1 \leq 10^5$</span> indicating the
    number of times the speed of the first car changed. The rest of
    the line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_1$</span>
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; T_1 &lt; T_2
    &lt; \ldots &lt; T_{n_1} \leq 10^6$</span> indicating the times
    (in seconds) the first vehicle changed speeds. So at time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_1$</span> it begins driving at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> m/s, at time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_2$</span> it stops, at time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_3$</span> it begins driving at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> m/s, and so on.</p>
<p>The last line begins with a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq N_2 \leq 10^5$</span> and is followed
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_2$</span> integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; T’_1 &lt; T’_2 &lt;
    \ldots &lt; T’_{n_2} \leq 10^6$</span> that describe the times
    the second vehicle starts and stops.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the vehicles collide, output the message <tt class="ttfamily">bumper tap at time</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> on a single line where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is the number of
    seconds from time <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> that
    the vehicles first collide, rounded up to the nearest second.
    If the vehicles do not collide, output the message <tt class="ttfamily">safe and sound</tt> on a single line.</p>
