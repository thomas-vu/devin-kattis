<div class="problembody">
<p>Your workplace is starting to become concerned with the cost
    of toner used for printing. Of course, some pages are more
    expensive to print than others. Your job is to write a program
    that helps to figure out how much toner it will take.</p>
<p>Each character requires a different amount of toner to
    print. For example, a space requires nothing but a capital Q
    requires <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span>. The
    following table gives the printing cost of each of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$95$</span> printable ASCII
    characters. The codes for these characters are consecutive,
    starting with <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span> for
    space and ending with <span class="tex2jax_process">$126$</span> for tilde (~).</p>
