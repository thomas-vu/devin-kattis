<p>Along with some friends you formed the Band of Atonal
    Percussionists and Cellists. You have been playing for some
    years together, but you feel unsatisfied with the current level
    of play. Doing research into some interesting new styles, you
    are gripped by the intricate details of the world of jazz.</p>
<p>While of course you cannot apply all the new things you have
    learned immediately, you want to start with improvising some
    nice new rhythmic figures in the music your band plays. You
    will play a rhythm where every bar has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> beats in it, but then you split up
    every beat into <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> notes.
    In total, you will have <span class="tex2jax_process">$nm$</span> notes per bar.</p>
<p>Everyone in the band knows that there is <em>no room for
    squares</em> in jazz. So the number of notes in a bar should be
    squarefree. That is, there is no number <span class="tex2jax_process">$k &gt; 1$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$k^2$</span> divides the number of notes in a
    bar.</p>
<p>The percussionist has already suggested a number of beats
    per bar <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>; now it is up
    to you to find a number of notes per beat that does not leave
    any room for squares.</p>
<p>In the second sample we have <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=30$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m=7$</span>. This works because <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq m &lt; n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m\cdot n = 210$</span> has no divisor
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k^2$</span> for any <span class="tex2jax_process">$k&gt;1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The input is a single squarefree integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\leq n\leq 10^5$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Output an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq
        m &lt; n$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$m
        \cdot n$</span> is still squarefree.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are multiple possible solutions, you may output any
    one of them.</p>
