<p>Oh no! Hackers are threatening to shut down Twitface, the
    premier social networking site. By taking advantage of lax
    security protocols, nefarious cyber-bandits have developed a
    virus that spreads from user to user, amplifying over time and
    eventually bringing the network to its knees from massive
    congestion. Normally users have to manually send messages to
    one another (squawking), but these neâ€™er-do-wells have figured
    out how to circumvent that rule, and have created squawks that
    spawn more squawks without user intervention. In particular,
    any time a user gets an infected squawk, one minute later it
    broadcasts an infected squawk to all its neighbors in the
    network (for purposes of this problem we assume that each
    neighbor gets the squawk exactly 1 minute after the initial
    user is infected). If a user receives multiple squawks at any
    point, the next minute it broadcasts that many squawks to all
    of its neighbors. For example, consider the following
    network:</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth ]{graph}" src="/problems/squawk/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:30.00%"/>
</center>
<p>If user <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> is infected
    at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t=0$</span>, then at
    time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t=1$</span> users
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> get <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> squawk each, at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t=2$</span> users <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> get <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> squawks each, and at time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t=3$</span>, users <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> get <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> squawks each and user <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> gets <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> squawks.</p>
<p>Given the layout of a social network and an initial
    infection site, you need to determine how many squawks are made
    at some given time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>. In
    the above example the number of squawks would be 2, 4 and 10 at
    times 1, 2 and 3, respectively.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will start with a line containing 4 integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> indicating the number of users
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\le n \leq 100)$</span>, the
    number of links between users <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0\le m \leq n(n-1)/2)$</span>, the index of
    the initially infected user <span class="tex2jax_process">$(s
    &lt; n)$</span>, and the number of minutes <span class="tex2jax_process">$(t &lt; 10)$</span>. Next will follow
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each consisting
    of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0 \leq x, y &lt; n)$</span> indicating that
    users <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> are connected. Connections are
    symmetric and no two connections will be the same.<br/></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of squawks sent at the specified time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>.</p>
