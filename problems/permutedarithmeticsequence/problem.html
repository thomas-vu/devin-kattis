<div class="problembody">
<p>An arithmetic sequence is a list of values where the
    difference between consecutive values is always the same. For
    example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3, 7, 11, 15$</span>
    qualifies and so does <span class="tex2jax_process">$25, 15, 5,
    -5, -15$</span>. However <span class="tex2jax_process">$2, 4,
    7$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3, 6, 9, 6$</span>
    are not arithmetic sequences.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100$</span>, on a line by
    itself. Following this are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each describing a sequence.
    Each line begins with an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq m \leq 100$</span>, giving the length
    of the sequence. This is followed by the <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> integer values that actually make
    up the sequence. Each of the sequence integers is in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-10^6,10^6]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each sequence, output a line that says “arithmetic” if
    the sequence is an arithmetic sequence. Output “permuted
    arithmetic” if the sequence can be reordered to make an
    arithmetic sequence. Otherwise, output “non-arithmetic”.</p>
