<p>Running a taxi station is not all that simple. Apart from
    the obvious demand for a centralised coordination of the cabs
    in order to pick up the customers calling to get a cab as soon
    as possible, there is also a need to schedule all the taxi
    rides which have been booked in advance. Given a list of all
    booked taxi rides for the next day, you want to minimise the
    number of cabs needed to carry out all of the rides.</p>
<p>For the sake of simplicity, we model a city as a rectangular
    grid. An address in the city is denoted by two integers: the
    street and avenue number. The time needed to get from the
    address <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a,b)$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(c,d)$</span> by taxi is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$|a - c| + |b - d|$</span>
    minutes. A cab may carry out a booked ride if it is its first
    ride of the day, or if it can get to the source address of the
    new ride from its latest, at least one minute before the new
    rideâ€™s scheduled departure. Note that some rides may end after
    midnight.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line of the input is a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 20$</span>, telling
    the number of test scenarios to follow. Each scenario begins
    with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; M &lt; 500$</span>, being the number of booked taxi rides.
    The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines
    contain the rides. Each ride is described by a departure time
    on the format <tt class="ttfamily">hh:mm</tt> (hours ranging
    from <tt class="ttfamily">00</tt> to <tt class="ttfamily">23</tt> and minutes ranging from <tt class="ttfamily">00</tt> to <tt class="ttfamily">59</tt>), two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> that are the
    coordinates of the source address and two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> that are the coordinates of the
    destination address. All coordinates are at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and strictly smaller than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span>. The booked rides in
    each scenario are sorted in order of increasing departure
    time.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each scenario, output one line containing the minimum
    number of cabs required to carry out all the booked taxi
    rides.</p>
