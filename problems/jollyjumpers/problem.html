<p>A sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n &gt;
    0$</span> integers is called a jolly jumper if the absolute
    values of the difference between successive elements take on
    all the values <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. For instance,</p>
<pre>
1 4 2 3
</pre>
<p>is a jolly jumper, because the absolutes differences are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> respectively. The definition
    implies that any sequence of a single integer is a jolly
    jumper. You are to write a program to determine whether or not
    each of a number of sequences is a jolly jumper.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \le 3000$</span> followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers representing the
    sequence. The values in the sequence are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$300\, 000$</span> in absolute value. Input
    contains at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    lines.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line of input, generate a line of output saying
    “<tt class="ttfamily">Jolly</tt>” or “<tt class="ttfamily">Not
    jolly</tt>”.</p>
