<div class="problembody">
<p>In the game of Sudoku, the objective is to place integers
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> (inclusive) into a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9\times 9$</span> grid so that
    each row, each column, and each of the nine <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\times 3$</span> boxes contains all nine
    numbers. The starting board is partially filled in so that it
    is possible to logically deduce the values of the other cells.
    Sudoku puzzles range in difficulty, and complex analysis
    methods are required to solve the hardest puzzles. In this
    problem, however, you will implement one of the simplest
    methods, cross-hatching.</p>
<p>In cross-hatching, we select one of the nine numbers and,
    for each of its occurrences in the grid, cross out the
    corresponding row, column and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\times 3$</span> box. Now look for any
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\times 3$</span> boxes where
    there is only one possible placement for the number and place
    it there.</p>
<p>The first image below shows a very sparsely filled in Sudoku
    grid. However, even in this grid it is possible to deduce using
    cross-hatching that the number in the top left cell is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, as illustrated in the
    second image.</p>

</center>
</div>
<p>You will be given a partially filled-in grid. Your task is
    to repeatedly apply the cross-hatching method for different
    numbers until no more deductions can be made about any
    number.</p>
<p>The initial placement of the numbers in the grid may be
    invalid. It is also possible that there will be no available
    cell for a number in a <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\times
    3$</span> box. In both cases, you are to report an error.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input will consist of <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> lines, each containing exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> characters. Each
    character will either be a digit between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, or a period (‘.’) denoting an
    empty cell.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the input is valid and there is no contradiction while
    solving, you should output the grid in the same format it was
    given in, with cells filled in if their value can be deduced
    using cross-hatching. Otherwise, output “<tt class="ttfamily">ERROR</tt>” (quotes for clarity).</p>
