<div class="problembody">
<p>Given a sequence of positive integers, count all contiguous
    subsequences (sometimes called <em>substrings</em>, in contrast
    to <em>subsequences</em>, which may leave out elements) the sum
    of which is divisible by a given number. These subsequences may
    overlap. For example, the sequence (see sample
    input)</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 2, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1,
    2 \]</span>
<p>contains six contiguous subsequences the sum of which is
    divisible by four: the first to eighth number, the second to
    fourth number, the second to seventh number, the third to fifth
    number, the fourth to sixth number, and the fifth to seventh
    number.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq c \leq 200)$</span>, the number of
    test cases. Then follow two lines per test case.</p>
<p>Each test case starts with a line consisting of two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq d \leq 1\, 000\, 000)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq n \leq 50\, 000)$</span>, the
    divisor of the sum of the subsequences and the length of the
    sequence, respectively. The second line of a test case contains
    the elements of the sequence, which are integers between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 000$</span>,
    inclusively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print a single line consisting of a
    single integer, the number of contiguous subsequences the sum
    of which is divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>.</p>
