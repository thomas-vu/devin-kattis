<div class="problembody">
<p>All the positive divisors of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> were written down together in a
    list. The numbers on the list were then shuffled around. Can
    you determine what <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> were, based on the
    list?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 210,000$</span>), the number of divisors on the
    list.</p>
<p>The next line contains the list of divisors, separated by
    spaces. All divisors are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{18}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> â€“ the smaller one first. If there
    are multiple possible <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, you may output
    any ones.</p>
<h2>Explanation of samples</h2>
<p>The divisors of <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>
    are <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>. The divisors of <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> are <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>.</p>
