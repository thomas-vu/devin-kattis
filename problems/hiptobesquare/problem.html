<p>Suppose we have a certain number of red square tiles, all of
    size <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \times 1,$</span> that we
    would like to place, without overlapping, to form the largest
    two-dimensional square possible, such that the only gap is a
    single <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \times 1$</span> square
    left empty in the middle. Depending on the initial number of
    tiles, it may not always be possible to use all the tiles to
    build such a configuration, i.e., some tiles may be left
    over.</p>

<p>Consider the following examples illustrated in FigureÂ 1
    (from left to right):</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Starting with only <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> red tiles, we can form a
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \times 2$</span> square,
        but without an empty <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
        \times 1$</span> square in the middle. Thus there are not
        enough tiles to form any square with an empty <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \times 1$</span> square in the
        middle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting with <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>
        red tiles, the largest square that can be formed with an
        empty <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \times 1$</span>
        square in the middle is of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \times 3,$</span> using all
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$8~ \textrm{red}$</span>
        tiles. In this case, there is <b class="bfseries">one layer
        of red tiles</b> surrounding the empty central square.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting with <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>
        red tiles, we could form a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4
        \times 4$</span> square using all the tiles, but there
        would be four empty <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \times
        1$</span> squares in the middle, i.e., an empty
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \times 2$</span> square.
        Thus, the largest square that can be formed with an empty
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \times 1$</span> square in
        the middle is still of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \times 3,$</span> using only
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> of the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> red tiles, and
        still with <b class="bfseries">one layer of red tiles</b>
        surrounding the empty central square (and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> tiles left over).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Starting with <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>
        red tiles, the largest square that can be formed with an
        empty <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \times 1$</span>
        square in the middle is of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \times 5,$</span> using all
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span> red tiles. In
        this case, there are <b class="bfseries">two layers of red
        tiles</b> surrounding the empty central square.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Given a number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N,$</span> of
    red tiles, determine the maximum number of layers that can be
    used to form a square with one empty <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \times 1$</span> square in the middle.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> This problem was inspired by a post to the
    LinkedIn group <em>The Math Connection</em> by Doddy
    Kastanya.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$T,$</span> the number of test cases
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq T \leq 1\, 000).$</span>
    This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    lines, each of which contains an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq N \leq 10^9),$</span> representing a number of red
    tiles.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N,$</span> output a line containing a single
    integer, the maximum number of layers of red tiles that can be
    used to build a square with a single empty <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \times 1$</span> square in the middle when
    starting with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    tiles.</p>
