<p>As the coach of your university’s ICPC teams, you encourage
    your students to solve as many Kattis problems as possible.
    This has numerous benefits — for example, it helps improve
    students’ competitive programming skills, and it also creates a
    strong sense of school spirit. The main reason for the latter
    is that each time a student solves a problem, not only does
    that student’s individual Kattis score increase, but so does
    the group score for your university. It is fun and motivating
    for your students (and you) to watch your university move up in
    the Kattis rankings.</p>
<p>The collective score for a group of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> Kattis users is calculated as
    follows: Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_0, s_1, \ldots ,
    s_{n-1}$</span> be the the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> individual scores in
    non-increasing order (i.e., <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_0
    \geq s_1 \geq s_2 \geq \ldots \geq s_{n-1}$</span>). Then the
    group score is</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \frac{1}{5}
    \, \sum _{i=0}^{n-1} s_ i \cdot \left( \frac{4}{5} \right)^ i
    \]</span>
<p>So, for example, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$n =
    3$</span> and the individual scores are <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_0 = 500$</span> , <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1 = 120$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_2 = 75$</span>, then the group score
    is</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \frac{1}{5} \left( 500
    \cdot 1 + 120 \cdot \left( \frac{4}{5}\right) + 75 \cdot \left(
    \frac{16}{25} \right) \right) \, = \, 128.8 \]</span>
<p>Thanks to Kattis, being an ICPC coach seems pretty easy, but
    sometimes you worry that the school spirit fostered by the
    Kattis ranking system is not enough to retain all your
    students. What if one of your students transfers to another
    university and, as a result, changes university affiliation on
    Kattis? How will this affect the group score for your
    university?</p>
<p>Actually, what you really want to know is the
    <em>average</em> new group score if exactly one of your
    students leaves. More precisely, if your students’ scores are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_0 \geq s_1 \geq s_2 \geq
    \ldots \geq s_{n-1}$</span>, let <span class="tex2jax_process">$g_ i$</span> be the new group score for your
    university if the student with score <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> leaves (and the other
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(n-1)$</span> students remain).
    What is the average value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$g_
    i$</span> over all all <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    students?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq
    50$</span>)</span>, the number of student competitive
    programmers at your university (all of whom use Kattis, of
    course). This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each containing one of your
    students’ Kattis scores. These scores are listed in
    non-increasing order, and each score is an integer between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>, inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two lines. On the first line, print your university’s
    current Kattis group score. On the second line, print the
    average of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$g_ i$</span>
    values as described above. Your output will be considered
    correct if each value is within <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> of the corresponding
    official value. (Note that although Kattis reports every score
    with exactly one digit after the decimal point, you should not
    round your answers.)</p>
