</div>Your friend Nick needs your help with a hard problem that
    he came across in real life. Nick has a loo roll of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> centimetres in his
    bathroom. Every time he visits the toilet, he uses exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> centimetres of loo
    roll. When the roll runs out, Nick always goes to the store and
    buys a new one of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell
    $</span> directly afterwards. However, sometimes the roll runs
    out even though Nick still needs a non-zero amount of paper.
    Let us call such an event a <em>crisis</em>.
    <p>Nick has a clever way of preventing crises from happening:
    he uses a backup roll. The backup roll is another roll of
    length <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> that is
    hidden somewhere in the bathroom, and when the regular roll
    runs out even though Nick still needs more paper, he will take
    that amount from the backup roll. Then he will replace the
    regular roll directly after the visit.</p>
<p>As you can imagine, this makes crises much less frequent.
    But still, the backup roll will also slowly run out, and
    eventually a crisis might still happen. So to generalize this,
    Nick wants to use several layers of backup rolls. First he will
    take paper from roll number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> (the regular roll), if it runs out
    he will take from roll number <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, then if roll <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> runs out from roll number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, and so on all the way
    up to roll number <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>.
    After each visit, all the rolls that have run out will be
    replaced. Nick managed to prove that if he picks a large enough
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, he can
    actually make it so that crises never happen! Your task is to
    find the smallest such number <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing the two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq \ell \leq
    10^{10}$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the smallest integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> such that crises will never happen
    when using <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> layers of
    rolls (including the regular roll).</p>
