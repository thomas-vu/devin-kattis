<p>Since entering <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^\text
    {nd}$</span> grade Theta has daily math homework sheets. The
    problems on her worksheet usually go like this:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
      There is a certain number of birds, dogs, and cats on a farm.
      Together they have <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>
      legs. How many birds, dogs, and cats could there be? Write
      down as many answers as you can!
    </blockquote>
<p>It is always the same problem, just written in different
    ways: sometimes with horses, cows, sheep, goats, chickens,
    beetles, or even spiders – but never with snakes or fishes!</p>
<p>Can you write a program to double-check Theta’s answers?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> representing the numbers of legs
    the first, second, and third type of animal has. You are given
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; b, c, d \le
    100$</span> because some farm animals in these math problems
    may be centipedes. The total number of legs is given by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le l \le 250$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output all possible answers, each on a separate line, in
    lexicographical order so that they are sorted by the number of
    the first animal, ties broken by the second and third animal
    numbers’, respectively. Separate the number of the first,
    second, and third animal with spaces. If there are no possible
    solutions, output <tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt> on a
    single line!</p>
