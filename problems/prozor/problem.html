<p>Young Marin, now already a respectable star of Croatian
    cinematography, spends his free time looking out the window.
    Unfortunately for him, the same activity is also taken up by a
    few flies that have landed on his window and are looking into
    the distance. Marin immediately hurried to get his square
    racket for killing flies. At the same time, he wondered how
    many flies it is possible to kill in one shot. After trying to
    scare away the flies unsuccessfully for a few hours, he decided
    to ask for your help.</p>
<p>Marin has sent you a picture of his window, the dimensions
    being <span class="tex2jax_process">$R \times S$</span> pixels
    and has also told you the length of the side of the racket he
    uses to kill the flies, in pixels. Your task is to determine
    the maximal amount of flies that Marin could have killed in a
    single shot and mark one such shot in the picture.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \leq K \leq R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S \leq
    100$</span>) that denote the dimensions of Marin’s picture and
    the length of the side of the racket.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> lines contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> characters that describe Marin’s
    picture. The picture’s pixels marked with ‘<tt class="ttfamily">*</tt>’ denote the position of a fly, whereas all
    the other pixels are marked with ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’
    and denote empty space. On his window, there is at least one
    fly that Marin can kill with his racket.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first line of output must contain the maximal number of
    flies Marin can kill in a single shot.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> lines
    must contain Marin’s picture, on it clearly marked a position
    of the racket that will ensure Marin kills as many flies as
    possible. The horizontal sides of the racket are denoted with a
    series of characters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">-</tt>’ and the
    vertical ones with ‘<tt class="ttfamily">|</tt>’, whereas
    angles are denoted with ‘<tt class="ttfamily">+</tt>’. For a
    more detailed explanation, consult the sample tests.</p>
<p>Please note: Marin’s racket will affect only the flies
    located strictly inside the racket, and the racket must be
    located inside the window with all its parts. In other words,
    it is assumed that the flies located at the sides of the racket
    will have enough time to fly away.</p>
