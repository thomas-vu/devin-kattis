<div class="problembody">
<p>Once upon a time in a land far far away, inhabited only by
    math students, Iva and Vedran were discussing self-explanatory
    sentences. A part of these sentences is exactly <em>one
    number</em> and it is <em>equal to the total number of letters
    in the sentence</em>. Some examples are: “This sentence has
    thirtyone letters.”, “Blah blah seventeen”.</p>
<p>Little Jurica overheard his friends’ conversation and
    decided to impress them with the amount of self-explanatory
    sentences he knows by heart. He rushed back home and wrote a
    programme which will, given a sentence, tell him the minimum
    number he can put inside so that the sentence is valid.
    Unfortunately, his computer broke and now he needs your help.
    Write a programme to help Jurica!</p>
<p>The form of the sentence is: <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{word}_1 \mathit{word}_2
    \mathit{word}_3 \ldots \$ \mathit{word}_{n-1} \mathit{word}_
    n$</span>. The character $ represents the place where the
    number should be put in. For example, the form of the sentence
    “this sentence has thirtyone letters” would be “this sentence
    has $ letters”.</p>
<p>The rules that apply to writing numbers are the
    following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>numbers from 1 to 10 are written “one”, “two”, “three”,
        “four”, “five”, “six”, “seven”, “eight”, “nine”, “ten”,
        respectively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>numbers from 11 to 19 are written “eleven”, “twelve”,
        “thirteen”, “fourteen”, “fifteen”, “sixteen”, “seventeen”,
        “eighteen”, “nineteen”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the remaining double digit numbers are written in a way
        that we name the tens’ digit and add to it the name of the
        one digit remaining when we remove the tens’ digit.
        Specially, if by removing the tens’ digit we remain with
        zero, we add nothing to it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the tens’ digits (respectively from 2 to 9) are named
        the following: “twenty”, “thirty”, “forty”, “fifty”,
        “sixty”, “seventy”, “eighty”, “ninety”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>three digit numbers are written in a way that we name
        the hundreds’ digit number and add to it the number of the
        double digit number remaining. Specially, if by removing
        the hundreds’ digit we remain with zero, we add nothing to
        it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the hundreds’ digits (respectively from 1 to 9) are
        named the following: “onehundred”, “twohundred”,
        “threehundred”, “fourhundred”, “fivehundred”, “sixhundred”,
        “sevenhundred”, “eighthundred”, “ninehundred”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the rules that apply for numbers with more than three
        digits <em>are not relevant</em> because the input data
        will always be such that <em>the output is less than a
        thousand</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of naming some numbers:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>68 = “sixty” + “eight” = “sixtyeight”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>319 = “threehundred” + “nineteen” =
        “threehundrednineteen”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>530 = “fivehundred” + “thirty” = “fivehundredthirty”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>971 = “ninehundred” + “seventy” + “one” =
        “ninehundredseventyone”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 20$</span>), the number of words in the sentence.
    Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines contains a word not longer than 50 lowercase letters of
    the English alphabet or the character $ (none of the words will
    be the name of a number). The character $ will appear exactly
    once.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the required
    sentence. The numbers are named as mentioned before, even if
    the sentence sounds gramatically incorrect. The input data will
    be such that a solution will always exist and is less than
    1000.</p>
