</div>When determining the age of a bull moose, the number of
    tines (sharp points), extending from the main antlers, can be
    used. An older bull moose tends to have more tines than a
    younger moose. However, just counting the number of tines can
    be misleading, as a moose can break off the tines, for example
    when fighting with other moose. Therefore, a point system is
    used when describing the antlers of a bull moose.

    <p>The point system works like this: If the number of tines on
    the left side and the right side match, the moose is said to
    have the even sum of the number of points. So, “an even
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>-point moose”, would
    have three tines on each side. If the moose has a different
    number of tines on the left and right side, the moose is said
    to have twice the highest number of tines, but it is odd. So
    “an odd <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>-point moose”
    would have <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> tines on
    one side, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> or less
    tines on the other side.</p>
<p>Can you figure out how many points a moose has, given the
    number of tines on the left and right side?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single line with two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le \ell \le 20$</span> is the number of
    tines on the <em>left</em>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le r \le 20$</span> is the number of
    tines on the <em>right</em>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line describing the moose. For even pointed
    moose, output “<tt class="ttfamily">Even <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span></tt>” where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is the points of the moose. For
    odd pointed moose, output “<tt class="ttfamily">Odd
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span></tt>” where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is the points of the
    moose. If the moose has no tines, output “<tt class="ttfamily">Not a moose</tt>”</p>
