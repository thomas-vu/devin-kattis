<div class="problembody">
<p>Jimmy and his friends like to visit large theme parks. In
    the current theme park there are many roller coasters which
    then are categorized by Jimmy. He assigns a fun value to each
    coaster; however, the fun decreases with each run.</p>
<p>More formally: for a specific roller coaster <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, Jimmy assigns two fun
    coefficients <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span>. While riding this
    roller coaster for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>-th time, Jimmy gains a fun value
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(i,k) = a_ i - (k-1)^2 \cdot
    b_ i$</span>. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(i,k)$</span>
    is non-positive, riding the roller coaster is no longer
    fun.</p>
<p>Jimmy tries to maximize the total fun until he leaves the
    park. Can you tell Jimmy how much fun he can gain for a given
    time?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case.</p>
<p>The first line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the amount of different roller
    coasters in the theme park (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0&lt; N\le 100$</span>).</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contain the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
    i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> are the fun coefficients as
    specified above and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>
    is the time for a single ride with the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th roller coaster (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le a_ i \le 1\, 000$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le b_ i \le 1\, 000$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; t_ i \le 25\, 000$</span>).</p>
<p>The next line contains a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> denoting the number of times that
    Jimmy is visiting the park (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le
    Q \le 1\, 000$</span>). Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines contains an integral time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ i$</span> that Jimmy spends
    during his <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th visit
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le T_ i \le 25\,
    000$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>
    possible times, print one line containing the maximal total fun
    value if Jimmy spends <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_
    i$</span> minutes in the theme park.</p>
