<p>Tomorrow is racing day. There will be yet another grand prix
    in yet another country. Beside the safety car, there are
    various other security measures in order to make sure that
    everybody is as safe as possible. Among these safety measures
    are the track marshals: special race officials standing along
    the track with an assortment of flags that they can use to
    signal various messages to the drivers. For instance, the
    yellow flag warns the drivers of a dangerous situation, and the
    blue flag is used to order a lapped car to make way for one of
    the faster cars.</p>
<p>Every marshal should be stationed in a so-called <em>marshal
    booth</em>, a kind of protected cage that is clearly visible
    from the race track. These booths are located at regular
    intervals of ten metres (one decametre) along the track. The
    track is circular and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>
    decametres long and therefore contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> booths.</p>
<p>Not every booth needs to be used. International racing
    regulations require that the distance between two consecutive
    marshals should be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> decametres, meaning that every
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> consecutive booths
    should contain at least one marshal. The marshals are not
    responsible for waving the finish flag, so it is not required
    (but also not forbidden) to have a marshal at the
    start/finish.</p>
<p>This leaves you with many ways of assigning marshals to the
    various booths along the track. Out of sheer curiosity you
    decide to calculate the total number of valid marshal
    assignments. Reduce your answer modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$123\, 456\, 789$</span> in case it gets too
    large.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>, the length of the track, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, the maximal distance
    between consecutive marshals along the track, satisfying
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq S \leq L \leq
    10^6$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>,
    the number of ways to put marshals modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$123\, 456\, 789$</span>. (Your answer must
    satisfy <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq W &lt; 123\,
    456\, 789$</span>.)</p>
<h2>Explanation of sample input 1</h2>
<p>In the first sample test case, the four solutions are to put
    marshals at distances <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, at distances
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, at distances <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, or, at distances <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> (in decametres) from the
    start.</p>
