<p>Many countries have a system of government where the
    parliament chooses the prime minister, who then forms a
    government. Generally, the parliament needs to elect the prime
    minister by majority vote. When no single party manages to get
    a majority in parliament, parties have to form a coalition that
    gets a majority vote. As a result, some countries have been
    without a government for years during negotiations!</p>
<p>The wizarding world realized that lacking a government for
    years is not sustainable because dark wizards could easily use
    the lack of government to take over the wizarding world without
    anyone fighting back. Thus it was decided that the minister of
    magic would be determined automatically as soon as everyone has
    cast their votes. The system they use for this is called
    <em>instant-runoff voting</em>.</p>
<p>In instant-runoff voting, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> candidates compete against each
    other in up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$C - 1$</span>
    rounds. After each round, if one of the candidates gets a
    majority vote, that candidate is elected. Otherwise, the least
    popular candidate is eliminated. If two candidates both are
    equally unpopular, the lowest numbered one is eliminated. Here,
    a majority vote requires a <em>strict</em> majority, i.e. more
    than half of the votes.</p>
<p>Votes for all the rounds are specified before the first
    round by giving a ranking of all the <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> candidates. Given such a ranking,
    a voter will vote for the highest ranked candidate in their
    ranking that hasn’t been eliminated. For example, if a voter
    has the ranking <span class="tex2jax_process">$4, 1, 2, 3,
    5$</span> and the candidates <span class="tex2jax_process">$1,
    4, 5$</span> have been eliminated, the voter will vote for
    candidate <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> in the next
    round.</p>
<p>Just as in the normal world, the wizarding world has a
    number of parties (more specifically <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> parties). Each party has a number
    of representatives in the parliament that choose the minister.
    You will be given the candidate rankings for each party. Can
    you determine who will win the election?</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample 1</h2>
<p>The favourite candidate of the four parties are <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>. Each party have a single vote, so
    candidates <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> get two votes each in
    the first round. In the first two rounds, this means candidates
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> have zero votes, so they will be
    eliminiated (first <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    since it is the lower-numbered candidate). Finally, candidate
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is eliminated since
    candidates <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> are both equally
    unpopular with <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> votes,
    but <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is the
    lower-numbered candidate. This means candidate <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> wins.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers – the number of
    candidates <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le C \le 10\, 000$</span>)
    and parties <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 100$</span>). The
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> lines describe
    each party. Each line starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le v \le 10^6$</span>), the number of votes that the party has
    in the parliament, followed by a permutation of the numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \dots , C$</span>, the
    party’s ranking of the candidates. The ranking is given from
    most preferred candidate to least preferred candidate.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the number of the candidate that is
    elected.</p>
