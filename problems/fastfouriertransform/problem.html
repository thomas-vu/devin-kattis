<p>You are given two polynomials. You should simply print their
    product. This time you have to do it fast though.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n, m$</span>, the number of
    coefficients in each polynomial. The next two lines contain one
    polynomial each. Each polynomial is given as its coefficients
    in ascending order, that is to say if the input is <tt class="ttfamily">a0 a1 a2 a3</tt> then that represents the polynomial
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + a_3
    x^3$</span>. You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$n, m \leq 10^5$</span> and that all
    coefficients <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_i$</span> satisfy
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^4 \leq a_i \leq
    10^4$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the product of the two polynomials in the input in the
    same format as the polynomials in the input. Do not print
    trailing zeroes, that is to say if the last number in the
    output is a zero it should be omitted unless it is the only
    number in the output.</p>
