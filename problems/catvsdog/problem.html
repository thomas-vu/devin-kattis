<p>The latest reality show has hit the TV: “Cat vs. Dog”.
    In this show, a bunch of cats and dogs compete for the very
    prestigious <span class="scshape">Best Pet Ever</span> title.
    In each episode, the cats and dogs get to show themselves off,
    after which the viewers vote on which pets should stay and
    which should be forced to leave the show.</p>
<p>Each viewer gets to cast a vote on two things: one pet which
    should be kept on the show, and one pet which should be thrown
    out. Also, based on the universal fact that everyone is either
    a cat lover (i.e. a dog hater) or a dog lover (i.e. a
    cat hater), it has been decided that each vote must name
    exactly one cat and exactly one dog.</p>
<p>Ingenious as they are, the producers have decided to use an
    advancement procedure which guarantees that as many viewers as
    possible will continue watching the show: the pets that get to
    stay will be chosen so as to maximize the number of viewers who
    get both their opinions satisfied. Write a program to calculate
    this maximum number of viewers.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of
    testcases, at most 100. After that per testcase:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le c,d\le 100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le v\le 500$</span>): the number of
        cats, dogs, and voters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> lines with two
        pet identifiers each. The first is the pet that this voter
        wants to keep, the second is the pet that this voter wants
        to throw out. A pet identifier starts with one of the
        characters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">C</tt>’ or ‘<tt class="ttfamily">D</tt>’, indicating whether the pet is a cat or
        dog, respectively. The remaining part of the identifier is
        an integer giving the number of the pet (between
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> for cats, and between
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> for dogs). So for instance,
        “<tt class="ttfamily">D42</tt>” indicates dog number
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$42$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per testcase:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with the maximum possible number of satisfied
        voters for the show.</p>
</li>
