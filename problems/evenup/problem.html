<p>The Even Up Solitaire can be played with a stack of cards
    each having a numerical value from 1 to 100. The cards are laid
    out from left to right in a row. At every step, the player is
    allowed to remove two adjacent cards if the sum of their values
    is even. The gap is then “closed” by shifting the cards to the
    right of the gap. The order of the remaining cards is not
    changed. The game stops when all cards are removed or when no
    more cards can be removed. The player wins when all cards are
    removed. If this is not possible, the player should try to
    minimize the number of cards remaining.</p>
<p>You are given the initial list of cards, in left-to-right
    order. Determine the minimum number of cards that remain if the
    player moves optimally.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one case. The first line contains an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100000$</span>) giving the
    number of cards to follow. The second line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers indicating
    the card values from left to right. Each card value is in the
    range 1 to 100.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the minimum number of cards that remain if the player
    moves optimally.</p>
