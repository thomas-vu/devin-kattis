<div class="problembody">
<p>Two major banks in our country are knee-deep in troubles. We
    will call them “Bank A” and “Bank B” – hopefully you understand
    we absolutely cannot tell you their real names. It might ruin
    them.</p>
<p>As a logical consequence of their troubles, government comes
    to rescue them, preparing a set of financial “packages” that
    will be distributed between these two banks. However, there is
    one important condition: the packages will be given to the
    banks one by one and we need to minimize the difference between
    the amount given to both banks in any particular moment.
    Otherwise, one of the banks would gain a big advantage over the
    other.</p>
<p>For example, imagine that we have four packages with the
    values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$110\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$120\, 000$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$150\, 000$</span>. If we give the first
    package to the Bank A, then the second one to the Bank B, the
    third one to the Bank B, and the fourth package to the Bank A,
    the difference between the help provided to the banks will be
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$+100\, 000$</span> after the
    first package, <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\, 000$</span>
    after the second one, <span class="tex2jax_process">$-130\,
    000$</span> after the third one, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$+20\, 000$</span> after the last package.
    The maximal difference is therefore <span class="tex2jax_process">$130\, 000$</span>.</p>
<p>There is a better solution, with the maximal difference of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> only: first,
    give <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> to the
    Bank A, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$120\, 000$</span>
    to the Bank B, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$110\,
    000$</span> to the Bank A, and then <span class="tex2jax_process">$150\, 000$</span> to the Bank B.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains multiple sets of financial packages. Each
    set begins with a line containing a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>: the number of
    financial packages (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N
    \leq 50\, 000$</span>). The second line is a set of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> positive integers
    separated by a space, all of them between <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$199\, 999$</span> inclusive. These numbers
    specify the amount of money in individual packages. Packages
    can be assigned in any order, the order of numbers on the
    second line is therefore not important. The last set will be
    followed by a line containing single zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each set of financial packages, output one line
    containing the order of assignments of packages to the banks,
    such as the maximal difference is as low as possible. If there
    are more possible solutions, you may print any of them.</p>
<p>Assignments must be separated by a space, each assignment
    consists of one number (the package size), one dash character
    (“<tt class="ttfamily">-</tt>”), and an uppercase letter
    (“<tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>” or “<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>”) specifying the bank.</p>
