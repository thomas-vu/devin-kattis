<div class="problembody">
<p>Arthur is participating in the Vietnamese Robotic Olympiad
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 020$</span>. In the first
    round, candidates must build a path-finding robot. More
    precisely, the organizers have prepared an infinite,
    obstacle-free grid. One candidate’s robot is placed at a
    starting position <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1,
    y_1)$</span> and must find a path to a target position
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2, y_2)$</span>.</p>
<p>Arthur’s robot is quite simple: it can only move in four
    directions: up, down, left and right, i.e. from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span>, it can moves to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y+1)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y-1)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x-1, y)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x+1, y)$</span>.</p>
<p>The first round is starting soon. However, Arthur just
    realized that some of the robot’s components are broken, and
    thus the robot cannot move in the same direction in two
    consecutive moves (i.e. it always changes direction after each
    move). For example, if the robot needs to go from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 1)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3, 3)$</span>, the robot can use the path
    shown on the right, but not the path shown on the left.</p>

<p>Please help Arthur find the minimum number of moves for his
    robot to get from some starting position to some ending
    one.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> - the number of test cases
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 1\, 000$</span>),
    then <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases
    follow. Each test case is presented in a single line with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_2$</span> which denote the starting and
    target position of the robot.</p>
<p>The absolute value of all integers in the input do not
    exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print the minimum number of moves for
    Arthur’s robot to get from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1,y_1)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2,y_2)$</span></p>
