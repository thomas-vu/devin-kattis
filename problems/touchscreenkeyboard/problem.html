<p>Nowadays, people do not use hardware keyboards but
    touchscreens. Usually, they touch on the wrong letters with
    their chunky fingers, because screen space is precious and the
    letters therefore too small.</p>
<p>Usually, a spell checker runs after typing a word and
    suggests other words to select the correct spelling from. Your
    job is to order that list so that more likely words are on
    top.</p>
<p>The typical touchscreen keyboard looks like this:</p>
<pre>
qwertyuiop
asdfghjkl
zxcvbnm
</pre>
<p>You should use the distance between the letters to type a
    word: the distance is the sum of the horizontal and vertical
    distance between the typed and proposed letter. Assume you
    typed a <tt class="tt">w</tt>, the distance to <tt class="tt">e</tt> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, while
    the distance to <tt class="tt">z</tt> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>.</p>
<p>The typed word and the list of words from the spell checker
    all have the same length. The distance between two words is the
    sum of the letter distances. So the distance between <tt class="tt">ifpv</tt> and <tt class="tt">icpc</tt> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input specifies the number of test
    cases <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; t &lt; 20$</span>). Each test case
    starts with a string and an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> on one line. The string gives the
    word that was typed using the touchscreen keyboard, while
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> specifies the number
    of entries in the spell checker list (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; l \le 10$</span>). Then follow
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> lines, each with one
    word of the spell checker list. You may safely assume that all
    words of one test case have the same length and no word is
    longer than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>
    characters (only lowercase ’<tt class="tt">a</tt>’ -
    ’<tt class="tt">z</tt>’). Furthermore, each word appears
    exactly once in the spell checker list on one test case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print the list of words sorted by their
    distance ascending. If two words have the same distance, sort
    them alphabetically. Print the distance of each word in the
    same line.</p>
