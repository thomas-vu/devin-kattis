        Illustration of the sample input solution (beams in blue).

<p>The Johnson Space Center has hired you to design NASA’s new
    communications satellite! The satellite, consisting of a set of
    dish antennas held together with titanium beams, must meet
    NASA’s exacting specifications, but a lot of the design is up
    to you.</p>
<p>Specifically, the design can be represented by a set of
    circles of various radii (representing the dish antennas) and
    line segments (the beams) in the 2D plane. A valid satellite
    design must meet all of the following criteria:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The necessary size and location of each dish on the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$xy$</span> plane was
        computed by NASA, and you are not allowed to reposition any
        of the dishes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may add any number of titanium beams to the design,
        connecting one point on the circumference of one dish
        antenna to another point on the circumference of a
        different dish. Treat each beam as a straight line segment
        (of negligible width).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Beams are not allowed to cross each other, or attach to
        each other. Beams are also not allowed to occlude (cover
        up) any part of the interior of any dish antenna.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your final design must consist of a single connected
        structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two dishes might exactly touch (in which case they are
        already connected to each other); but NASA guarantees that
        no two dish antennas overlap.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Titanium isn’t cheap these days, so you want to compute the
    cheapest possible compliant design: the one that <em>minimizes
    the sum</em> of the beam lengths.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 2\, 000$</span>,
    the number of dish antennas attached to the satellite.</p>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines,
    each of which contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> specifying the location and radius
    of one dish antenna. These integers satisfy the bounds
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1\, 000 \leq X, Y\leq 1\,
    000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq R \leq
    100$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Compute the satellite design that minimizes the sum of beam
    lengths, while obeying the above specifications, and print that
    sum. The answer is considered correct if the absolute or
    relative error is less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
