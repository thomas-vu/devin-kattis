<div class="problembody">
<p>A very important and complicated machine consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> wheels, numbered
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \ldots , n$</span>. They
    are actually cogwheels, but the cogs are so small that we can
    model them as circles on the plane. Every wheel can spin around
    its center.</p>
<p>Two wheels cannot overlap (they do not have common interior
    points), but they can touch. If two wheels touch each other and
    one of them rotates, the other one spins as well, as their
    micro-cogs are locked together.</p>
<p>A force is put to wheel <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> (and to no other wheel), making it
    rotate at the rate of exactly one turn per minute, clockwise.
    Compute the rates of other wheels’ movement. You may assume
    that the machine is not jammed (the movement is physically
    possible).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the number of test cases
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 11$</span>) . The descriptions
    of the test cases follow:</p>
<p>Each test case consists of one line containing the number of
    wheels <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span>) . Each of the
    following lines contain three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\, 000 \leq x, y \leq 10\, 000$</span>;
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq r \leq 10\, 000$</span>)
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span> denote the
    Cartesian coordinates of the wheel’s center and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is its radius.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each describing the
    movement of one wheel, in the same order as in the input. For
    every wheel, output either <tt class="ttfamily"><span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span> clockwise</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily"><span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span>
    counterclockwise</tt>, where the irreducible fraction
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span> is the number of
    wheel turns per minute. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, output just <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> as an integer. If a wheel is
    standing still, output <tt class="ttfamily">not
    moving</tt>.</p>
