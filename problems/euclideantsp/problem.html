</div>The famous Arora-Mitchell approximation algorithm for the
    Euclidean Travelling Salesman Problem (Euclidean TSP) was
    discovered independently by Sanjeev Arora and Joseph
    S. B. Mitchell in 1998. It can approximate the value
    of an optimal TSP tour in <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> dimensions within a factor of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1+1/c$</span> in running time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">\[ n (\log n)^{O((c\sqrt
    {d})^{d-1})}, \]</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number
    of nodes in the tour.</p>
<p>Miroslava works for a computer security company and it is
    time to renew a shared cryptographic key in many data centres
    across Europe. To do this, Miroslava is going to rent a private
    jet and deliver the key to employees waiting at all major
    European airports. She wants to be back as soon as
    possible.</p>
<p>Miroslava’s company has a computer that is able to execute
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> billions of operations
    per second. Since we can approximate Europe by a
    two-dimensional plane, we assume that the Arora-Mitchell
    algorithm runs for exactly</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    \frac{n (\log _2 n)^{c\sqrt {2}}}{p \cdot 10^9} \]</span>
<p>seconds on this computer to produce the exact <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1+1/c)$</span>-approximation of the optimal
    tour.</p>
<p>Miroslava noticed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is a parameter of the algorithm
    that can be used to her advantage, but one also needs to be
    very careful when choosing the right value. If she sets
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> too low, the algorithm
    will finish very fast but the time she spends flying around
    Europe will be too long. On the other hand, setting it too high
    will force her to wait for an answer from the computer, while
    she could be flying instead.</p>
<p>Miroslava used to work in a different company and from there
    she knows that the optimal tour of all major European airports
    is <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> meters long, but
    she wasn’t ranked high enough in the company to know the actual
    tour. Given the speed <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>
    of the private jet in meters per second, Miroslava needs
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s(1 + 1 / c) / v$</span> seconds
    to complete the tour produced by the algorithm run with
    parameter <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>. For the
    sake of simplicity, we assume that Miroslava can land, leave a
    copy of the private key and take off from each airport in an
    instant.</p>
<p>How long does it take Miroslava to first run the algorithm
    and then distribute all the keys, assuming that she chooses the
    optimal parameter <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one line with four numbers:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$4 \le n \le 1\, 000\,
        000$</span>), the number of airports;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a real number <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0.001 \le p \le 5\,
        000$</span>), the number of billions of operations the
        computer can execute per second;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a real number <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6 \le s \le
        10^9$</span>), the length of the optimal tour of all
        European airports in meters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a real number <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$50 \le v \le 900$</span>),
        the speed of the private jet in meters per second.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All real numbers will have at most 10 digits after the
    decimal point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with the shortest possible time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> in seconds to distribute the keys
    and the value of the parameter <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> Miroslava should use to achieve
    time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>. Your answer
    should have an absolute or relative error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
