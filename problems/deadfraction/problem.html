</div>Mike is frantically scrambling to finish his thesis at
    the last minute. He needs to assemble all his research notes
    into vaguely coherent form in the next 3 days. Unfortunately,
    he notices that he had been extremely sloppy in his
    calculations. Whenever he needed to perform arithmetic, he just
    plugged it into a calculator and scribbled down as much of the
    answer as he felt was relevant. Whenever a repeating fraction
    was displayed, Mike simply reccorded the first few digits
    followed by “...”. For instance, instead of “1/3” he might have
    written down “0.3333...”. Unfortunately, his results require
    exact fractions! He doesn’t have time to redo every
    calculation, so he needs you to write a program (and FAST!) to
    automatically deduce the original fractions.

    <p>To make this tenable, he assumes that the original fraction
    is always the simplest one that produces the given sequence of
    digits; by <em>simplest</em>, he means the the one with
    smallest denominator. Also, he assumes that he did not neglect
    to write down important digits; no digit from the repeating
    portion of the decimal expansion was left unrecorded (even if
    this repeating portion was all zeroes).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There are several test cases. For each test case there is
    one line of input of the form “0.<em>dddd</em>...” where
    <em>dddd</em> is a string of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> digits, not all zero. A line
    containing 0 follows the last case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, output the original fraction.</p>
