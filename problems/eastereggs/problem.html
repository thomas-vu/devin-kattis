<p>Easter is coming and the Easter Bunny decided to organise a
    chocolate egg hunt for the children. He will hide two types of
    eggs: blue milk chocolate and red dark chocolate. In the field
    there are some redberry and some blueberry plants where the
    Easter Bunny could hide the eggs. Red eggs should be hidden in
    a redberry plant and blue eggs in a blueberry plant.</p>
<p>The local government has issued a permit for the event,
    under the condition that exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> eggs are hidden. As they do not
    pay for the dental care plans of the local children, the Easter
    Bunny gets to decide himself how many eggs to hide of each
    colour.</p>
<p>According to the yearly tradition, there is a big reward for
    the first child to find both a red and a blue egg. In order to
    make the hunt as challenging as possible, the Easter Bunny
    wants to maximise the minimum distance between a red and a blue
    egg. To keep things fair, he will hide at most one egg in each
    plant. Your task is to write a program to help him accomplish
    his goal.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of the following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line containing three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N, B, R$</span>, the number of eggs to
        hide <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \leq 250$</span>, the
        number of blueberry plants <span class="tex2jax_process">$B
        &lt; N$</span> and the number of redberry plants
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$R &lt; N$</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> lines, each
        containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^4 \leq x,y \leq 10^4$</span>,
        indicating the coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> of a blueberry plant;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> lines, each
        containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^4 \leq x,y \leq 10^4$</span>,
        indicating the coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> of a redberry plant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$B+R$</span> plants are
    guaranteed to have distinct coordinates. Moreover, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is guaranteed to satisfy
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \leq B+R$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing a floating point number,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>, the largest minimum
    distance between a red and a blue egg that can be achieved. You
    are required to output <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>
    with absolute precision <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>, i.e.Â with at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> decimal places.</p>
