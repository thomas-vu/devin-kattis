<p>A word cloud (or tag cloud) is a visual representation of
    textual data based on a weighted metric. In the above cloud
    (which is based on this year’s list of Mid-Central teams), the
    font size of each word is based on its number of occurrences in
    the data set. Tagg Johnson is a man obsessed with counting
    words that appear in online documents. On his computer, he
    keeps a spreadsheet of all the sites he visits, along with a
    list of words that appear on each site and the number of times
    such word appears. Tagg would like to generate word clouds
    based on the data he has collected.</p>
<p>Before describing the algorithm Tagg uses for generating
    clouds, we digress for a quick lesson in typography. The basic
    unit of measure is known as a point (typically abbreviated as
    <em>pt</em>). A font’s size is described based on the vertical
    number of points from one line to the next, including any
    interline spacing. For example, with a 12pt font, the vertical
    space from the top of one character to the top of a character
    below it is 12 points. We assume that a character’s height is
    precisely equal to the font’s point size (regardless of whether
    the character is upper or lower case).</p>
<p>For this problem, we focus on a fixed-width font, such as
    Courier, in which each character of the alphabet is also given
    the same amount of width. The character width for such a font
    depends on the font size and the aspect ratio. For Courier, a
    word with <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> characters
    rendered in a font of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> has a total width of <span class="tex2jax_process">$\left\lceil \frac{9}{16} \cdot t \cdot P
    \right\rceil $</span> when measured in points. Note well the
    use of the ceiling operator, which converts any noninteger to
    the next highest integer. For example, a 5-letter word in a
    20pt font would be rendered with a height of 20 points and a
    width equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$\left\lceil
    \frac{900}{16} \right\rceil = \left\lceil 56.25\right\rceil
    =57$</span> points.</p>
<p>Now we can describe Tagg’s algorithm for creating a word
    cloud. He pre-sorts his word list into alphabetical order and
    removes words that do not occur at least five times. For each
    word w, he computes a point size based on the formula
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P=8+\left\lceil \frac{40\cdot
    (c_ w-4)}{(c_{max}-4)}\right\rceil $</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ w$</span> is the number of occurrences of
    the word, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_{max}$</span> is
    the number of occurrences of the most frequent word in the data
    set. Note that by this formula, every word will be rendered
    with anywhere from a 9pt font to a 48pt font. He then places
    the words in rows, with a 10pt horizontal space between
    adjacent words, placing as many words as fit in the row,
    subject to a maximum width <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> for his entire cloud. The height
    of a given row is equal to the <em>maximum</em> font size of
    any word rendered in that row.</p>
<p>As a tangible example, consider the following data set and
    word cloud.</p>

<p>In this example, <tt class="ttfamily">apple</tt> is rendered
    with 23pt font using width 65pt, <tt class="ttfamily">banana</tt> is rendered with 11pt font using width
    38pt, and <tt class="ttfamily">grape</tt> is rendered with 48pt
    font and width 135pt. If the overall word cloud is constrained
    to have width at most 260, those three words fit in a row and
    the overall height of that row is 48pt (due to grape). On the
    second row <tt class="ttfamily">kiwi</tt> is rendered with
    height 43pt and width 97pt, and <tt class="ttfamily">orange</tt> is rendered with height 28pt and width
    95pt. A third row has <tt class="ttfamily">strawberry</tt> with
    height 23pt and width 130pt. The overall height of this word
    cloud is 114pt.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is composed of <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> data sets (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leqslant T \leqslant 20$</span>).</p>
<p>Each data set begins with a line containing two integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. The value <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> denotes the maximum width of the
    cloud; <span class="tex2jax_process">$W \leqslant 5000$</span>
    will be at least as wide as any word at its desired font size.
    The value <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leqslant N
    \leqslant 100$</span> denotes the number of words that appear
    in the cloud. Following the first line are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> additional lines, each having a
    string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> that is the
    word (with no whitespace), and an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> that is a count of the number of
    occurrences of that word in the original data set, with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \leqslant C \leqslant
    1000$</span>. Words will be given in the same order that they
    are to be displayed within the cloud.</p>
<p>A pair of zeroes, <tt class="ttfamily">0 0</tt>, will be
    placed on the last line to indicate the end of the input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set, output the word <tt class="ttfamily">CLOUD</tt> followed by a space, a serial number
    indicating the data set, a colon, another space, and the
    integer height of the cloud, measured in font points.</p>
