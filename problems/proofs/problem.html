<p>You are teaching discrete math. You have done your best to
    teach your students about axioms and inference rules, proofs
    and theorems. Sometimes the students write beautiful proofs
    that Fermat would be proud of but sometimes, also like Fermat,
    their proofs are not quite right. You are getting a little
    tired of hunting through some of these so-called “proofs” for
    the magic tricks that let them prove <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 = 2$</span> and had the great idea to
    write a computer program to speed things up!</p>
<p>Because this is the first class in proof-based mathematics,
    you have started your students off with a simple proof system.
    All proof lines consist of a list of assumptions, an arrow, and
    a conclusion. If there are no assumptions, the conclusion is an
    axiom. A line of the proof is valid if and only if all
    assumptions were conclusions of previous lines. Sometimes the
    students derive a conclusion more than once just to be extra
    sure it is true, and that is perfectly all right!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 400\, 000$</span>, the number of
    lines in the “proof”. Then follow the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines of the “proof”. Each line
    has <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le a \le 5$</span>
    assumptions, followed by an arrow (the string “<tt class="ttfamily">-&gt;</tt>”), followed by one conclusion. All
    assumptions and conclusions consist of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le c \le 5$</span> uppercase alphabetic
    characters. The assumptions, arrow, and conclusion are all
    separated by single spaces.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If every line is correct output “<tt class="ttfamily">correct</tt>”. Otherwise, output the number of the
    first line with an error (line numbers start at <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>).</p>
