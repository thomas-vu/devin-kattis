<p>Alice and Bob are biologists. They like to group animals
    using classification trees. A classification tree is a binary
    tree where the leaves are labeled by the animals.</p>
<p>For example, Figure 1 below shows the classification of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> animals (labeled as
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, 3, 4, 5$</span>) by Alice
    and Bob. Alice’s classification has nine groups: <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 2\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 3\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 4\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 5\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 2, 5\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 2, 5\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 2, 3, 5\} $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} $</span>. Bob’s
    classification also has nine groups: <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 2\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 3\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 4\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 5\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 5\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 2, 3\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 2, 3, 5\} $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} $</span>.</p>

<p>As you can observe, Alice and Bob classify the animals
    differently. Carol is interested to know the number of common
    groups between the classifications of Alice and Bob. For the
    above example, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> common groups. They are:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 2\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 3\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 4\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 5\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 2, 3, 5\} $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} $</span>.</p>
<p>Carol usually counts the number of common goups by hand. On
    one day, an outer space alien came to our earth. He asked Alice
    and Bob to classify aliens in outer space. The number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> of aliens can be as
    big as <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>. It is
    impossible to count the number of common goups by hand now. Can
    you make a program to help Carol?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of three lines:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 100\, 000$</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the classification tree of Alice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the classification tree of Bob</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that both classification trees are leaf-labeled by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. The tree is represented by the
    parathesis encoding. (Note that the encoding only have numbers
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> symbols, that is,
    ‘(’, ‘)’, ‘,’.) For the example in Figure 1, see Sample
    Input 1.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with a single integer that represents the
    number of common groups between Alice and Bob’s classification
    trees.</p>
