<div class="problembody">
<p>Your friend Charmion asked you to hang some canvases out to
    dry on a straight washing line for an art project she has been
    working on. The canvases are artfully arranged such that none
    of them overlap, although they may touch along the edges. For
    stability, each canvas must be held by two pegs, but because
    the canvases are very rigid, they can be held from
    anywhere.</p>
<p>Each canvas is an integral number of centimetres wide (at
    least <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> cm). Each peg
    is slightly less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    cm wide. Canvases and pegs are all placed at integral
    centimetre positions along the line.</p>
<p>Unnecessary things touching any canvas is a smudge risk,
    thus every canvas should be held by exactly two pegs, no more
    and no less. Given all of the pegs that are already attached to
    the line, place as few as possible additional pegs as necessary
    to hold all of the canvases.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10^3$</span>), the number
        of canvases on the line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th of which
        contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell _
        i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq \ell _ i &lt; r_ i
        \leq 10^9$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell _
        i + 10 \le r_ i$</span>), the positions of the left and the
        right end of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th
        canvas in centimetres.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq p \leq 2 \cdot 10^3$</span>), the
        number of pegs already used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, \ldots , x_
        p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x_ i &lt;
        x_{i+1} \leq 10^9$</span> for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>), the position of each
        existing peg in centimetres.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Canvases are given from left to right and may touch only at
    edges, that is <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i \le \ell
    _{i+1}$</span> for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the canvases can be secured, output the smallest number
    of extra pegs needed to secure all of the canvases while
    touching each exactly twice. On the next line output the
    integer positions of all of the new pegs.</p>
<p>Otherwise, output “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”.</p>
<p>If there are multiple optimal solutions, you may output any
    one of them.</p>
