<p>Every so often, a shipment of universal robots comes from
    Earth to Mars in order to help you with routine colonization
    tasks. The robots are called Organ-free Men (precisely
    OFMv5001.41.912) and each one of them is identified by a unique
    serial number, which is a positive integer.</p>
<p>To prevent space theft, OFMs are transported from Earth to
    Mars in a locked state and have to be first unlocked by a
    special password. The password to unlock an OFM is based on its
    serial number and a function <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(x)$</span>. The function <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(x)$</span> is defined as follows.</p>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x \le 9$</span>,
    then <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(x) = x!$</span>, and if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x &gt; 9$</span>, then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(x) = (x \mod 10)! + f(\lfloor
    x/10 \rfloor $</span>). The brackets <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lfloor \rfloor $</span> denote the floor
    value of a number (e.g. <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lfloor
    2.43 \rfloor = 2$</span>). Exclamation mark denotes the
    factorial, i.e., <span class="tex2jax_process">$x! = 1 \cdot 2
    \cdot \cdots \cdot x$</span> for <span class="tex2jax_process">$x &gt; 0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0! = 1$</span>.</p>
<p>To unlock an OFM with a serial number <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, you need to input smallest such
    non-negative integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>,
    so that <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(x) = y$</span>
    holds.</p>
<p>Will you manage to unlock all robots that were shipped to
    you?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le y \le 10^9$</span>), the serial number of a particular
    OFM.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single non-negative integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, the password to unlock the
    particular OFM.</p>
