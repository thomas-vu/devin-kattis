</div>The recent vote in Puerto Rico favoring United States
    statehood has made flag makers very excited. An updated flag
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$51$</span> stars rather
    than the current one with <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> would cause a huge jump in U.S.
    flag sales. The current pattern for <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> stars is five rows of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> stars, interlaced with
    four offset rows of <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>
    stars. The rows alternate until all stars are represented.

<p>This pattern has the property that adjacent rows differ by
    no more than one star. We represent this star arrangement
    compactly by the number of stars in the first two rows:
    <tt class="tt">6,5</tt>.</p>
<p>A <span class="tex2jax_process">$51$</span>-star flag that
    has the same property can have three rows of <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> stars, interlaced with three rows
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> stars (with a
    compact representation of <tt class="tt">9,8</tt>). Conversely,
    if a state were to leave the union, one appealing
    representation would be seven rows of seven stars (<tt class="tt">7,7</tt>).</p>
<p>A flag pattern is <em>visually appealing</em> if it
    satisfies the following conditions:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Every other row has the same number of stars.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adjacent rows differ by no more than one star.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first row cannot have fewer stars than the second
        row.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Your team sees beyond the short-term change to <span class="tex2jax_process">$51$</span> for the US flag. You want to
    corner the market on flags for any union of three or more
    states. Given the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> of stars to draw on a flag, find
    all possible <em>visually appealing</em> flag patterns.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3\le S\le 32\, 767$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>On the first line, print <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, followed by a colon. Then, for
    each visually appealing flag of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> stars, print its compact
    representation, one per line.</p>
<p>This list of compact representations should be printed in
    increasing order of the number of stars in the first row; if
    there are ties, print them in order of the number of stars in
    the second row. The cases <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-by-<span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>-by-<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> are trivial, so do not print those
    arrangements.</p>
<p>The compact representations must be printed in the form
    “<tt class="tt">x,y</tt>”, with exactly one comma between
    <tt class="tt">x</tt> and <tt class="tt">y</tt> and no other
    characters.</p>
