<div class="problembody">
<p>The city of Manhattan is well known for its regular
    arrangement of numbered streets and avenues (streets run
    east-west and avenues run north-south), which can be modeled by
    a grid superimposed on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x\textrm{-}y$</span> plane with vertical and
    horizontal lines at integer values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x~ \textrm{and}~ y$</span>. The
    <em>Manhattan distance</em> (or <em>taxicab distance</em>)
    between two points, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1 = (x_1,
    y_1)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_2 = (x_2,
    y_2)$</span>, is given by</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    \left| x_1 - x_2 \right| + \left| y_1 - y_2 \right| \]</span>
<p>(here we assume integer coordinates, although Manhattan
    distance can also be applied more generally). This captures the
    idea that the shortest distance between two intersections in
    Manhattan (for a vehicle like a car or truck that is restricted
    to travelling along streets and avenues) is the sum of the
    differences between the street numbers and the avenue numbers
    (in absolute value for each).</p>
<p>But this simple model ignores one of the most famous
    features of Manhattan — <em>Broadway!</em> Known as a
    global center for live theater, especially musical theater,
    Broadway (which is a road) is also significant because, in a
    certain part of Manhattan, it cuts at an angle across the
    regular grid of streets and avenues. If a vehicle can travel
    along Broadway for at least part of its journey, this
    potentially reduces the shortest distance between its starting
    point and its destination relative to a trip along only streets
    and avenues.</p>
<p>We will model Broadway by adding a single non-vertical and
    non-horizontal line segment to the grid described above. This
    line segment has endpoints with integer coordinates,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(\mathit{bx}_1,
    \mathit{by}_1)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(\mathit{bx}_2, \mathit{by}_2)$</span>, and
    each point where it intersects a vertical or horizontal grid
    line creates a new intersection (unless one exists there
    already).</p>
<p>Now what is the shortest distance from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2, y_2)$</span> for a vehicle that can
    travel along any street or avenue, and can also travel along
    Broadway? Note that all streets, all avenues, and Broadway are
    bi-directional.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of test cases
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq n \leq 100)$</span>.
    This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines, each of which contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> space-separated integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{bx}_1$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{by}_1$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{bx}_2$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{by}_2$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_2$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$(\mathit{bx}_1, \mathit{by}_1)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(\mathit{bx}_2,
    \mathit{by}_2)$</span> are the endpoints of Broadway,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1)$</span> is the
    starting intersection of a trip through Manhattan, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2, y_2)$</span> is the
    destination intersection. Each coordinate is in the interval
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1,50]$</span>. It is guaranteed
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{bx}_1 \neq
    \mathit{bx}_2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\mathit{by}_1 \neq \mathit{by}_2$</span>,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1) \neq (x_2,
    y_2)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the
    shortest distance between <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1,
    y_1)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2,
    y_2)$</span> as described above. An answer will be considered
    correct if it is within <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> of the official answer.</p>
