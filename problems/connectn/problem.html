<p>A popular connection game that is well-known around the
    world is Connect Four. In this two-person game, each player is
    assigned a colored disc (red or blue) and takes turns dropping
    one of their colored discs from the top into a seven-column,
    six-row vertically upright game board. The disc will go into
    the lowest free row of that column. The objective of the game
    is to be the first player to form four discs in a horizontal,
    vertical, or diagonal line. The below diagrams show examples of
    ways for a player to win:</p>

<p>In this problem, you will not implement the Connect Four
    game in its entirety. However, you will be writing a program
    that checks whether there is currently a win on the board.
    Additionally, there are two modifications to the game:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The game is no longer Connect Four but rather
        Connect-<span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, where
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the number of
        discs a player needs to form a winning horizontal,
        vertical, or diagonal line.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board has dimensions <span class="tex2jax_process">$(X,Y)$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is the number of rows and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> is the number of
        columns. Thus, the game board is no longer a static
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$(6,7)$</span> grid.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You will be given the specification of a
    Connect-<span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> board and the
    location of all the colored discs on the board. Based on this
    information, you will need to determine whether the red player,
    blue player, or no player has a Connect-<span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> on the board.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains the specification of a single
    Connect-<span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> board. The
    specification starts with a line with three non-zero positive
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> that specify the dimensions of the
    board and the connection amount (<span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> are described in the problem
    description above). This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> lines, each corresponding to a
    line of the board. Each of these lines has <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> characters, each separated from
    the next by a single space, corresponding to each column of
    that row. A <tt class="ttfamily">R</tt> denotes that there is a
    red disc in that position, a <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>
    denotes that there is a blue disc in that position, while a
    <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt> denotes that there is no disc in
    that position.</p>
<p>You can assume the following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Possible values for the dimensions of the board range
        from <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> to
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> (i.e.,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leqslant X \leqslant
        100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leqslant
        Y \leqslant 100$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> will always be
        less than or equal to the board dimensions (i.e.,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$N\leqslant X$</span>, and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$ N\leqslant Y$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For a given board, if there is a winner on the board
        then it is either red or blue and not both.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output contains a single line denoting if there is a
    winner on the board. If the red player has a
    Connect-<span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> then print
    <tt class="ttfamily">RED WINS</tt>. If the blue player has a
    Connect-<span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> then print
    <tt class="ttfamily">BLUE WINS</tt>. If the board has no winner
    (i.e., no player has a Connect-<span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>) then print <tt class="ttfamily">NONE</tt>.</p>
