<div class="problembody">
<p>For a boat on a small, constrained body of water, other
    traffic can be a major hazard. The more traffic there is in the
    same area, the higher the risk of a collision.</p>
<p>Your job is to monitor traffic and help detect likely
    collisions before they occur. You have sensors to detect the
    position, direction, and speed of each boat. Assuming the
    direction and speed remain constant, your task is to determine
    whether any of the boats will collide. Two boats are considered
    to collide if they come within a given distance of each
    other.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, the number of test
    cases to follow. Each test case starts with a line containing
    two numbers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the
    number of boats, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>,
    the collision distance. Two boats are considered to collide if
    they come within <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
    metres of each other. There will be no more than 1000 boats.
    Each boat is identified by a line containing four numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>. The numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> give the current position of the
    boat as a distance east and north, respectively, from a common
    origin, and will be between <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1\,
    000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>,
    inclusive. The lake is small enough that we can model it as a
    flat surface. The number <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> gives the direction in which the
    boat is heading in degrees clockwise from north (so east is 90
    degrees). The number <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
    gives the speed of the boat in metres per second, and will be
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.001$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>. Note that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> are not necessarily integers. The
    input data will be such that the answer will not change if any
    of the numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> are changed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> or less.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing a single
    integer, the number of seconds, rounded to the nearest second,
    before any of the boats come within <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> metres of each other. If none of
    the boats ever collide, output the line:</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">No collision.</tt></p>
