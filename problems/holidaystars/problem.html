        A Holiday Star hurtling towards a wall
      </div>
</div>
<p>It is the time for the Holidays, which means it’s time for
    the annual Holiday Cookie Throwing contest where cookies are
    thrown against a wall. Cookies are really simple polygons that
    rotate clockwise while in flight.</p>
<p>Due to many years of advanced research and precise throwing
    equipment, these cookies can fly under idealized conditions:
    their center of mass follows an ideal parabola (<span class="tex2jax_process">$g = 9.81 \frac{m}{s^2}$</span>), and their
    angular velocity stays constant.</p>
<p>Given a cookie’s shape, initial angle and speed as well as
    its angular velocity, compute which of the cookie’s corners
    hits the wall first, and when!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> numbers: an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le n \le 20$</span>) denoting the number
    of vertices of the cookie polygon, a real number <span class="tex2jax_process">$\omega $</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le \omega \le 10$</span>), the angular
    velocity in <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text
    {rad}/s$</span> in <em>clockwise</em> direction, a real number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_0$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le v_0 \le 10$</span>), the initial
    velocity of the cookie in <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{m}{s}$</span>, an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$\theta $</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le \theta \le 80$</span>), the initial
    angle of the cookie’s trajectory, given in degrees measured
    counter-clockwise relative to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 0)$</span> unit vector, a real number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$20 \le w \le 500$</span>), denoting the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-coordinate of the wall
    towards which the cookie is moving. You may assume that there
    are no other objects in space aside from the cookie, and that
    the wall is of infinite height (e.g., from <span class="tex2jax_process">$-\infty \ldots \infty $</span>).</p>
<p>This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines, one for each vertex. Each line contains two real numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$|x_ i| &lt; 20, |y_ i| &lt; 20$</span>)
    denoting the initial position of a cookie’s corner. Corners are
    numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \ldots n$</span>. The
    cookie polygon’s vertices are given in counter-clockwise order.
    The polygon is simple (e.g., not self-intersecting) and has a
    non-zero area.</p>
<p>All real numbers are given with no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> decimal digits after the
    period.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ i$</span>, denoting the
    index <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i \le n$</span>) of the corner that
    hits the wall first and the time <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ i$</span> in seconds when that happens.
    The index corresponds to the order in the input. <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ i$</span> must be given with an absolute
    error of less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span>! You may assume that no two
    vertices hit the wall within <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-2}$</span> seconds of each other, and
    that the first vertex to hit the wall would pierce it for at
    least <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span>
    seconds.</p>
