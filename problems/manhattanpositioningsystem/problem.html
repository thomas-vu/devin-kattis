<p>The Manhattan Positioning System (MPS) is a modern variant
    of GPS, optimized for use in large cities. MPS assumes all
    positions are discrete points on a regular two-dimensional
    grid. Within MPS, a position is represented by a pair of
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$(X,Y)$</span>.</p>
<p>To determine its position, an MPS receiver first measures
    its distance to a number of beacons. Beacons have known, fixed
    locations. MPS signals propagate only along the <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> axes through the streets of the
    city, not diagonally through building blocks. When an MPS
    receiver at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(X_ R,Y_ R)$</span>
    measures its distance to a beacon at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(X_ B,Y_ B)$</span>, it thus obtains the
    Manhattan distance: <span class="tex2jax_process">$|X_ R - X_
    B|+|Y_ R - Y_ B|$</span>.</p>
<p>Given the positions of a number of beacons and the
    Manhattan-distances between the receiver and each beacon,
    determine the position of the receiver. Note that the receiver
    must be at an integer grid position (MPS does not yet support
    fractional coordinates).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of beacons
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 1000$</span>).
    Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines,
    each containing three integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y_ i$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ i$</span>, such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^6 \leq X_ i, Y_ i \leq 10^6$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq D_ i \leq 4 \cdot
    10^6$</span>. The pair <span class="tex2jax_process">$(X_ i, Y_
    i)$</span> denotes the position of beacon <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, while <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ i$</span> is the Manhattan distance
    between receiver and beacon <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
<p>No two beacons have the same position.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If there is exactly one receiver position consistent with
    the input, write one line with two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_ R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y_ R$</span>, the position of the
    receiver.</p>
<p>If multiple receiver positions are consistent with the
    input, write one line with the word “<tt class="ttfamily">uncertain</tt>”.</p>
<p>If no receiver position is consistent with the input, write
    one line with the word “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”.</p>
