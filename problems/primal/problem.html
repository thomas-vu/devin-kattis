<p>The Math department has challenged the Computer Science
    department at your University to solve a difficult puzzle in
    Discrete Mathematics. With the pride of your Computer Science
    department at stake, you must solve this puzzle!</p>
<p>In this puzzle, you are given a sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> positive integers. The sequence
    must be partitioned into <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> consecutive contiguous regions,
    with at least 1 integer in each region. After finding a
    partition, it is scored in a strange way. In each region, you
    must find the largest prime number that divides every number in
    that region. The Math department reminds you a prime number is
    an integer greater than 1 where its only divisors are 1 and
    itself. If you cannot find such a prime, your score for that
    region is 0. Your total score for the partition is the minimum
    over all regions.</p>
<p>Your task is to find the maximum possible score. The Math
    department will win if their score is better, so be sure to
    find the maximum each time!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that
    your program may be run multiple times on different inputs.
    Each input begins with a line with two space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 20\, 000$</span>) and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le k \le \min (100,n)$</span>), where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of
    positive integers in the original sequence, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is the number of regions in the
    partition. The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le v \le 1\, 000\, 000$</span>). This is
    the sequence to be partitioned, in order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer representing the maximum score
    possible partitioning the sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> positive integers into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> regions.</p>
