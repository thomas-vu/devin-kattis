<p>It occurs frequently in pop music, but also in other music
    genres, that the popular songs follow the same chord
    progression. This gives listeners a feeling of familiarity, and
    therefore increases the chances that they will enjoy the song.
    However, this can cause issues regarding copyright. Because the
    chord progression is often the same, there is a limited amount
    of melodies, or the notes which are sung, to be considered.
    Therefore, legal cases have popped up, in which a composer is
    accused of plagiarism. The reason is that part of one song’s
    melody sounds exactly the same as part of another song’s
    melody.</p>
<p>For example, Katy Perry was sued by Marcus Gray over the
    song Dark Horse. Originally, the court ruled in favour of
    Marcus Gray, but the verdict was overturned on the basis that
    the part of the melody in question was not particulary unique
    or rare. It can be dangerous to set a precedent where everyone
    can sue everyone over a few notes. That is why, usually, the
    part has to be a good portion of the song, not just a few
    seconds. On occasion, it may occur, that two songs are exactly
    the same over a long time period and then the belief is that an
    act of plagiarism has been committed. There is however the
    chance that it is a coincidence. The reason for that is there
    are mathematics behind what tones sound nice in sequence, which
    composers either know or have an intuition for.</p>
<p>Now a record label is worried that their intellectual
    property is being violated. It takes too long to listen to all
    the songs that might be the same, so the record label contacts
    you. The request is for a program which can analyze two songs
    simultaneously, one from the record label and the other from
    the alleged plagiarizer. The program should determine whether
    the songs sound similar enough to warrant legal action. The
    record label is extremely worried about filing a lawsuit that
    would be judged in the favour of the defendant, and therefore
    only wants to sue if the songs are the same in their entirety,
    according to music theory.</p>
<p>Each <em>note</em>, or tone, has its own frequency. It is
    sufficient to set a frequency for one note and then the
    frequencies of the other notes may be calculated according to a
    rule. An <em>octave</em> is defined as the interval between two
    notes where one note’s frequency is double the other’s
    frequency. In traditional European music, the octave is usually
    split into <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>
    frequencies which are in sequence, and are called the chromatic
    scale, with an equal interval from one note to the next which
    is named <em>semitone</em> or <em>half step</em>. A <em>whole
    step</em> is then two half steps. On a piano you can see these
    twelve tones, repeated, once in each octave, but usually with
    incomplete octaveson the far left and the far right.</p>

<p>Pianos are designed around the seven tone major scale,
    specifically <tt class="ttfamily">C</tt> major. The base note
    is then <tt class="ttfamily">C</tt> and the scale follows the
    formula: whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole
    step, whole step, half step. The notes are named after the
    letters <tt class="ttfamily">A-G</tt>, as can be seen in the
    image, and the <tt class="ttfamily">C</tt> major scale consists
    of the notes <tt class="ttfamily">C D E F G A B</tt>, which
    correspond to the white keys on the piano. The notes which are
    not in the <tt class="ttfamily">C</tt> major scale are exactly
    the notes corresponding to the black keys on the piano. They
    are named based on the other notes with additional half steps
    up or down. A half step up is written by adding <tt class="ttfamily">#</tt> after the note, but a half step down is
    written by adding a <tt class="ttfamily">b</tt> after the note.
    Therefore the notes in an octave are <tt class="ttfamily">C
    C#/Db D D#/Eb E F F#/Gb G G#/Ab A A#/Bb B</tt>, but also note
    that one can write <tt class="ttfamily">Cb</tt> for <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">B#</tt> for <tt class="ttfamily">C</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Fb</tt> for <tt class="ttfamily">E</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">E#</tt> for
    <tt class="ttfamily">F</tt>. To signify on which octave each
    note is being played, an integer is added to the back of the
    note. The octaves are in increasing order from left to right
    and the first <tt class="ttfamily">C</tt> note marks the start
    of octave <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. If the
    fourth octave were written up in its entirety it could be
    written as <tt class="ttfamily">C4 C#4 D4 D#4 E4 F4 F#4 G4 G#4
    A4 A#4 B4</tt>. The note on the far left on an <span class="tex2jax_process">$88$</span> key piano is <tt class="ttfamily">A0</tt>, the note known as middle <tt class="ttfamily">C</tt> is <tt class="ttfamily">C4</tt>, marked by a
    triangle in the image, and the note on the far right is
    <tt class="ttfamily">C8</tt>.</p>
<p>Melodies are a big part of songs and they can be defined as
    a series of notes and rests. Rests are symbolized by <tt class="ttfamily">-</tt> and represent the absence of sound. Each note
    or rest lasts for the same amount of time. To determine whether
    two songs are the same you can use the following rules:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Rule 1: If two melodies are written exactly the same,
        then they represent the same song. For example, the
        melodies <tt class="ttfamily">C4 D4 - E4</tt> and
        <tt class="ttfamily">C4 D4 - E4</tt> are the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rule 2: If two melodies are written differently, but the
        notes are equivalent, then they represent the same song.
        For example, the melodies <tt class="ttfamily">C4 C#4 -
        Eb4</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">B#3 Db4 - D#4</tt> are
        the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rule 3: If two melodies are written the same, except all
        the notes in one of them have been transposed, or shifted,
        by the same number of octaves, then they represent the same
        song. For example, the melodies <tt class="ttfamily">B3 D4
        - E4</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">B5 D6 - E6</tt> are the
        same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rule 4: If two melodies are written the same, except all
        the notes in one of them have been transposed, or shifted,
        by the same number of semitones, then they represent the
        same song. For example, the melodies <tt class="ttfamily">B3 D4 - E4</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">C#4 E4
        - F#4</tt> are the same.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the songs have not been determined to be the same after
    the application of these rules, then the songs are not the
    same.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with one line containing a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$</span>, which represents
    the length of each melody. Next two lines follow, each with a
    melody, where the melodies consist of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> values representing notes or
    rests, separated by spaces. Notes and rests are written in the
    same form as mentioned previously in the statement. The lowest
    note appearing in the input is <tt class="ttfamily">A0</tt> and
    the highest note is <tt class="ttfamily">C8</tt>, corresponding
    to an <span class="tex2jax_process">$88$</span> key piano. Each
    note will have a maximum of one <tt class="ttfamily">#</tt>
    symbol or <tt class="ttfamily">b</tt> symbol.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <tt class="ttfamily">Jebb</tt> if the songs are the
    same, and the record label should sue, otherwise output
    <tt class="ttfamily">Neibb</tt>.</p>
