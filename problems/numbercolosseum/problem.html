<p>Welcome to the Number Colosseum, where two teams of integers
    are preparing to battle! On the left side of the number line we
    have team <i class="itshape">Negatives</i> while on the right
    side we have team <i class="itshape">Positives</i>. Every
    integer fighting in the colosseum is on one of these two
    teams.</p>
<p>At the start of the battle, the contestants line up outside
    the colosseum. One by one, the contestants enter the colosseum
    and follow these rules:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If there are no contestants from the other team, this
        contestant will wait and become the most recent contestant
        to have entered the colosseum.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If at least one contestant of the opposing team is in
        the colosseum, this contestant will fight the contestant on
        the opposing team who has most recently entered the
        colosseum. The winner of a fight between a negative integer
        and positive integer is the one with the highest absolute
        value. After a fight occurs, the value of the winner
        becomes the sum of two fighting integers while the loser
        leaves. Note that if the two integers have the same
        absolute value, they both lose and both leave. If there is
        a winner, they will continue fighting as long as there are
        more opposing contestants. Otherwise, they will wait.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After all of the integers have entered the colosseum, only
    one team may be declared the winners of the Number Colosseum!
    Given the lineup of contestants for the upcoming battle, write
    a program to determine which team will triumph as well as the
    state of the colosseum after all fights have occurred.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$</span>), which is the number of
    contestants who will enter the colosseum. The second line
    contains the lineup of contestants. This will contain
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_
    N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq |x_ i| \leq
    10^6$</span> for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i
    \leq N$</span>), the value of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th contestant entering the
    colosseum.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the winning team with either <tt class="ttfamily">Positives win!</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">Negatives win!</tt>. On the following line display
    the list of integers remaining in the colosseum after all
    fighting has finished. Display these integers in the order of
    arrival into the colosseum.</p>
<p>If neither team wins, display <tt class="ttfamily">Tie!</tt>
    instead.</p>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>In Sample Input <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N = 4$</span> and the
    contestants have lined up in this order <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-3, -4, 9, 1]$</span>.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>First, contestant <span class="tex2jax_process">$-3$</span> enters the colosseum which
        now contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$(-3)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, contestant <span class="tex2jax_process">$-4$</span> enters the colosseum which
        now contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$(-3,
        -4)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> enters
        and fights <span class="tex2jax_process">$-4$</span>.
        Contestant <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> wins
        and becomes <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> while
        contestant <span class="tex2jax_process">$-4$</span> loses
        and leaves. Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>
        fights <span class="tex2jax_process">$-3$</span>, wins, and
        becomes <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> while
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$-3$</span> loses and leaves.
        The colosseum now contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> enters
        the colosseum. The final state of the Colosseum is
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 1)$</span> and Positives
        win!</p>
</li>
