</div>As a new employee at the Northwestern Europe Routing
    Company (NWERC), you do a lot of thinking about wireless
    network architectures. Lately you learned about a multi-channel
    mesh network architecture (called <em>Hyacinth</em>) that
    equips each mesh network node with multiple network interface
    cards (NICs) to increase the network throughput. You can choose
    a channel frequency for each NIC. In order to communicate, for
    every two network nodes that are in range of each other, their
    NICs must share at least one common frequency. The theoretical
    throughput is optimal when the total number of used frequencies
    in the network is maximal.

    <p>Your bosses at NWERC want you to figure out a procedure for
    assigning frequencies to the NICs such that the number of
    frequencies in use is maximized, subject to the constraint that
    all pairs of adjacent nodes must be able to communicate. A
    frequency is considered used if any pair of nodes within range
    of each other share that frequency. In the mesh network that
    you will be dealing with, each node is equipped with exactly
    two NICs (i.e., each node can use at most two frequencies).
    Since you are new at NWERC, your bosses further restrict the
    network layouts to make your job easier: the network graph will
    form a tree.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 10\, 000$</span>), the
        number of nodes in the network;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> lines, each
        with two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i,j \leq n$</span> signifying
        that the (one-indexed) network nodes <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> are in range of each
        other.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a frequency assignment for each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2n$</span> NICs such that all adjacent nodes
    can communicate and the number of used frequencies is
    maximized. You should output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th line contains the two
    frequencies of network node <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. Valid frequencies are nonnegative
    integers less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>.</p>
