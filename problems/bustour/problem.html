<div class="problembody">
<p>Imagine you are a tourist in Warsaw and have booked a bus
    tour to see some amazing attraction just outside of town. The
    bus first drives around town for a while (a <em>long</em>
    while, since Warsaw is a big city) picking up people at their
    respective hotels. It then proceeds to the amazing attraction,
    and after a few hours goes back into the city, again driving to
    each hotel, this time to drop people off.</p>
<p>For some reason, whenever you do this, your hotel is always
    the first to be visited for pickup, and the last to be visited
    for dropoff, meaning that you have to suffer through two
    not-so-amazing sightseeing tours of all the local hotels. This
    is clearly not what you want to do (unless for some reason you
    are <em>really</em> into hotels), so let’s fix it. We will
    develop some software to enable the sightseeing company to
    route its bus tours more fairly—though it may sometimes mean
    longer total distance for everyone, but fair is fair,
    right?</p>
<p>For this problem, there is a starting location (the
    sightseeing company headquarters), <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> hotels that need to be visited for
    pickups and dropoffs, and a destination location (the amazing
    attraction). We need to find a route that goes from the
    headquarters, through all the hotels, to the attraction, then
    back through all the hotels again (possibly in a different
    order), and finally back to the headquarters. In order to
    guarantee that none of the tourists (and, in particular,
    <em>you</em>) are forced to suffer through two full tours of
    the hotels, we require that every hotel that is visited among
    the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lfloor h/2 \rfloor
    $</span> hotels on the way to the attraction is also visited
    among the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lfloor h/2
    \rfloor $</span> hotels on the way back. Subject to these
    restrictions, we would like to make the complete bus tour as
    short as possible. Note that these restrictions may force the
    bus to drive past a hotel without stopping there (this is not
    considered visiting) and then visit it later, as illustrated in
    the first sample input.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of each test case consists of two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le n \le 20$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le m$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of locations
    (hotels, headquarters, attraction) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number of pairs of
    locations between which the bus can travel.</p>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> different
    locations are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> is the headquarters, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-2$</span> are the hotels, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> is the attraction. Assume that
    there is at most one direct connection between any pair of
    locations and it is possible to travel from any location to any
    other location (but not necessarily directly).</p>
<p>Following the first line are <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each containing three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le u, v \le n-1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$u \ne v$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le t \le 3600$</span>, indicating that
    the bus can go directly between locations <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> in <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> seconds (in either direction).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, display the case number and the time in
    seconds of the shortest possible tour.</p>
