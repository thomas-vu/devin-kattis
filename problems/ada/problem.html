<p>While mostly known for the programs she wrote for Charles
    Babbage’s Analytic Engine, Augusta Ada King-Noel, Countess of
    Lovelace, described how the method of finite differences could
    be used to solve all types of problems involving number
    sequences and series. These techniques were implemented in
    Babbage’s Difference Engine.</p>
<p>The algorithm: If we compute the difference between
    consecutive values in a numeric sequence, we will obtain a new
    sequence which is related to the derivative of the function
    implied by the original sequence. For sequences generated from
    first-order polynomials (linear functions) the successive
    differences will be a list of identical values, (i.e., a
    constant difference). For second-order polynomial functions the
    lists of differences will be a new sequence whose values change
    linearly. In turn, the list of differences of the values in
    this generated list (i.e., the finite differences of the list
    of differences) will be constant, and so on for higher-order
    polynomials. In general the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n^{\text {th}}$</span> row of differences
    will be constant for an <span class="tex2jax_process">$n^{\text
    {th}}$</span> degree polynomial.</p>
<p>For example, the first-order polynomial <span class="tex2jax_process">$3x + 3$</span> produces the sequence below
    at <span class="tex2jax_process">$x=0,1,2,3,4$</span>, and the
    first differences are shown on the following line.</p>
<pre>
3     6     9    12    15  
   3     3     3     3
</pre>
<p>As another example, the polynomial <span class="tex2jax_process">$x^2$</span>, if evaluated at inputs
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x=3, 5, 7, 9,$</span> produces
    the sequence below.</p>
<pre>
9    25    49    81
  16    24    32
      8     8
</pre>
<p>Furthermore, if we consider a minimum-order polynomial that
    produces the original sequence, its value at the next regularly
    spaced input can be predicted by extending the difference
    table.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a value <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, designating the number of
    polynomial evaluations given with <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 10$</span>, follwed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> values <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_1, v_2, \ldots , v_{n}$</span> which
    represent the value of a polynomial when evaluated at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> regularly spaced input
    values. Each <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ j$</span> will
    satisfy <span class="tex2jax_process">$-2\, 000\, 000 \leq v_ j
    \leq 2\, 000\, 000$</span> and at least two of those values
    will differ from each other.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two integer values <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_{n+1}$</span>, separated by a space. The
    value <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> must be the
    degree of a minimal-degree polynomial producing the original
    sequence, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_{n+1}$</span>
    must be the value of the polynomial if evaluated at the next
    regularly spaced input value.</p>
