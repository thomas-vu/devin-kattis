<p>Jack and Jill have decided to sell some of their Compact
    Discs, while they still have some value. They have decided to
    sell one of each of the CD titles that they both own. How many
    CDs can Jack and Jill sell?</p>
<p>Neither Jack nor Jill owns more than one copy of each
    CD.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a sequence of test cases. The first
    line of each test case contains two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, each at most one million,
    specifying the number of CDs owned by Jack and by Jill,
    respectively. This line is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines listing the catalog numbers
    of the CDs owned by Jack in increasing order, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> more lines listing the catalog
    numbers of the CDs owned by Jill in increasing order. Each
    catalog number is a positive integer no greater than one
    billion. The input is terminated by a line containing two
    zeros. This last line is not a test case and should not be
    processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing one integer,
    the number of CDs that Jack and Jill both own.</p>
