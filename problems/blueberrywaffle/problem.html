<div class="problembody">
<p>You are using a waffle maker machine to make a delicious
    blueberry waffle. One side of your waffle is covered in
    blueberries, while the other side is plain. Initially, the
    cooking pan of the waffle maker lies horizontally, and the
    blueberries are on the top side of the waffle. Once started,
    the cooking pan will rotate at a constant speed for a fixed
    duration, then stop. The cooking time is set so that when the
    waffle maker stops, the cooking pan will not be in a vertical
    position.</p>
<p>If the cooking pan is not horizontal after this time, the
    waffle maker will return to a horizontal position via the
    smallest rotation possible. Therefore, the waffle maker will
    rotate less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span>
    degrees, either forward or backward, until the cooking pan is
    horizontal again.</p>
<p>The pan rotates at a rate of 180 degrees every <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> seconds, and stops after
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> seconds. You don’t
    want to take out your waffle with its blueberry side down.
    Therefore you’d like to figure out whether the blueberry side
    of the waffle is up or down after the cooking pan returns to a
    horizontal position.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The single line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq r, f \leq 10^4$</span>). The pan rotates at a rate of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$180$</span> degrees every
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> seconds, and stops
    after <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> seconds. It is
    guaranteed that after <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>
    seconds the cooking pan is not at a vertical position.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line with a single string, which is
    <tt class="tt">up</tt> if the blueberry side of the waffle is
    up, or <tt class="tt">down</tt> otherwise.</p>
