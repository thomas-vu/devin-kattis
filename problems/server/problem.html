<p>You are in charge of a server that needs to run some
    submitted tasks on a first-come, first-served basis. Each day,
    you can dedicate the server to run these tasks for at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> minutes. Given the
    time each task takes, you want to know how many of them will be
    finished today.</p>
<p>Consider the following example. Assume <span class="tex2jax_process">$T = 180$</span> and the tasks take
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$45, 30, 55, 20, 80,$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> minutes (in order
    they are submitted). Then, only four tasks can be completed.
    The first four tasks can be completed because they take
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$150$</span> minutes, but not the
    first five, because they take <span class="tex2jax_process">$230$</span> minutes which is greater than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$180$</span>. Notice that
    although there is enough time to perform the sixth task (which
    takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> minutes) after
    completing the fourth task, you cannot do that because the
    fifth task is not done yet.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line
    contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 50$</span> is the number of
    tasks and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le T \le
    500$</span>. The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> positive integers no more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> indicating how long
    each task takes in order they are submitted.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the number of tasks that can be completed in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> minutes on a
    first-come, first-served basis.</p>
