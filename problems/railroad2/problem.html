<p>Theta likes to play with her DUPLO railway set. The railway
    set she has consists of pieces of straight tracks, curved
    tracks, Y-shaped switches, and X-shaped level junctions, as
    well as bridges that allow one track to cross over another.
    There are also straight tracks that are railroad crossings to
    allow car traffic to cross.</p>
<p>Close-ups of some of the pieces are shown below:</p>
<div class="figure">
<p><img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth ]{a.jpg}" src="/problems/railroad2/file/statement/en/img-0001.jpg" style="width:25.00%"/> <img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth ]{b.jpg}" src="/problems/railroad2/file/statement/en/img-0002.jpg" style="width:25.00%"/> <img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth ]{c.jpg}" src="/problems/railroad2/file/statement/en/img-0003.jpg" style="width:25.00%"/></p>
</div>
<p>To play, she picks a number of X-shaped level junctions and
    a number of Y-shaped switches and connects them with straight
    and curved pieces, using bridges as necessary.</p>
<p>Because the set doesn’t include any bumpers, she wants to
    build a closed track, like all the examples shown in the manual
    that came with the set:</p>

<p>Unfortunately, sometimes, this doesn’t seem to work with the
    number of X-shaped level junctions and Y-shaped switches she
    starts out with.</p>
<p>She quickly figures out exactly when it is possible to build
    a closed track - can you figure it out, too?</p>
<p>Write a program that outputs if it is possible to build a
    railroad that does not require any bumpers (i.e., which does
    not have any dead-end tracks).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case with two integer
    numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le X \le 1000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le Y \le 1000$</span>) denoting the number of level junctions
    and switches, respectively. You may assume that Theta has
    sufficiently many straight and curved pieces as well as
    bridges.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <tt class="ttfamily">possible</tt> if she can build a
    closed track using all level junctions and all switches without
    any dead ends, or <tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>
    otherwise.</p>
