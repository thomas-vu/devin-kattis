<p>FreeCell Solitaire is, just as computer science, mostly
    about sorting. The goal is to sort a deck of cards using a
    fairly convoluted algorithm.</p>
<p>The rules are the following: A shuffled deck is laid out in
    eight stacks. Only the topmost card of a stack may be moved. A
    card of value <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> may be
    moved to the top of another stack only if the column is empty,
    or if the topmost card of the destination stack is of the
    opposite color and of value <span class="tex2jax_process">$v+1$</span>. For instance the three of
    hearts may be moved on top of the four of clubs. At your
    disposal you have four free cells (think of them as the
    available memory if you like!) that are initially empty. Free
    cells can hold at most one card each, which can be moved
    according to the same rules as stack cards. Figure 1 below
    illustrates a few legal moves.</p>

<p>Most FreeCell computer games allow you to move a pile of
    cards, provided there are enough empty cells and empty stacks
    to accomplish this by moving cards from the pile one by one. In
    the image above for instance, the whole pile with 5, 4 and 3
    can be moved over 6 of spades by using some of the free cells
    and the empty stack to temporarily hold 3 and 4.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>You would like to move a sorted pile of <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> cards from one stack to the top of
    another stack which is non-empty, but of appropriate color and
    value. You will ignore all other non-empty stacks, because
    otherwise you would have to take into account the color and
    value of the topmost card of those stacks and that would be too
    complicated.</p>
<p>Even though you ignore the other non-empty stacks, you can
    still use <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> free cells
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> empty stacks. Is
    it possible to perform this move?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several test cases. Each test case is
    represented by a line with three numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> respectively. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the number of free cells,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> is the number of empty
    stacks and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> is the size
    of the pile you are moving. We are considering a generalized
    form of Free Cell in which <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq N, M \leq 5$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq K \leq 100$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The program should print “<tt>yes</tt>” if it is possible to
    move a pile of <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> cards
    using <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> free cells and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> empty stacks, and
    “<tt>no</tt>” otherwise.</p>
