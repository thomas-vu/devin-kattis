<p>Carl the ant is back! After traversing meandering paths
    (Problem A, 2004 World Finals) and wandering over octahedrons
    (Problem C, 2009 World Finals) it is time for a little vacation
    â€” time to see the sights! And where better to see the sights
    than at the tips of tall structures like, say, pyramids!! And
    where better to see tall pyramids but Egypt!!! (This is so
    exciting!!!!!)</p>
<p>After taking in the view from the tip of one pyramid, Carl
    would like to go to the tip of another. Since ants do not do
    particularly well in the hot sun, he wants to find the minimum
    distance to travel between the tips of these two pyramids,
    assuming he can only walk on the surfaces of the pyramids and
    the plane which the pyramids sit upon. The pyramids are,
    geometrically, right square pyramids, meaning the apex of the
    pyramid lies directly above the center of a square base.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains five integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, h$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^5\leq x_1,x_2,y_1,y_2 \leq
    10^5$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1) \ne
    (x_2, y_2)$</span>) define an edge of the first pyramid, with
    the body of the pyramid lying to the left of the directed
    vector from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1)$</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2, y_2)$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq h \leq 10^5$</span>) is the height of
    the pyramid. The second line of input describes the second
    pyramid in the same format. The intersection of the bases of
    the two pyramids has <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    area.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum distance Carl travels between the tips of
    the two pyramids. Your answer should have an absolute or
    relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
