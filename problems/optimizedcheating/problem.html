<div class="problembody">
<p>Bob’s favorite game just released a limited-time item for
    sale that will boost his game character’s power significantly.
    However, there is not enough time for Bob to acquire sufficient
    in-game currency to purchase the item. Bob thus decides to
    resort to a cheat tool he found online to modify his in-game
    currency value.</p>
<p>The cheat tool will take two values <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> specified by Bob and overwrites
    all memory slots that contain the value <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> with the value <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>. Bob does not want to use the
    cheat tool unsafely. He does not want to modify any memory
    slots other than the one that stores his currency value and
    cause the game to crash. Therefore, Bob needs to make sure that
    his currency value does not have any duplicate in the game’s
    memory space before running the cheat tool. Bob can use a set
    of operations provided by the game to modify his currency
    value, such as doing missions, purchasing items, and so on.
    Those operations can add, subtract, multiply or divide his
    currency value by a constant. All those operations will only
    change Bob’s currency value, and they will not affect any other
    memory slots. Bob cannot use an operation that would cause his
    currency value to become negative (e.g. buying an item that
    costs more than his available currency).</p>
<p>Bob knows that the memory space of the game can be
    represented as an array consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers. He also knows the
    location of the memory slot within this array that stores his
    currency value. However, Bob does not know how to modify his
    currency value as quickly as possible in order to use the cheat
    tool safely. Can you help him?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 10^4, 1 \leq m \leq 1\, 000, 1 \leq k \leq
    n$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is
    the number of memory slots in the game’s memory space,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number of
    operations that Bob can use, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-based index of the memory slot
    that stores Bob’s in-game currency value in the game’s memory
    space.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    contain a single integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>, giving the values stored in
    the game’s memory space in order.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each
    contain a single character <tt class="tt">p</tt> (<tt class="tt">+</tt>, <tt class="tt">-</tt>, <tt class="tt">*</tt>, or
    <tt class="tt">/</tt>) and an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq v \leq 10^9$</span>) that describe one operation that Bob
    can use to change his currency value. If Bob’s current currency
    value is <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>, then after
    applying the operation his currency value will become
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> <tt class="tt">p</tt>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>. For instance,
    applying an operation <tt class="tt">+</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> will increase Bob’s currency value
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. Divisions are
    integer divisions (e.g., <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> <tt class="tt">/</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 = 2$</span>). An operation cannot be
    applied if it would result in a negative currency value. Each
    operation can be applied multiple times (including zero).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is possible for Bob to make to his in-game currency
    value unique in the game’s memory space, output a single
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> on the first
    line, the minimum number of operations that Bob must apply.
    Then output <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> lines that
    each have an integer denoting the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-based index of the operation that
    Bob should apply in order. If there are multiple ways to apply
    the operations, you may output any of them.</p>
<p>If it is impossible for Bob to make his currency value
    unique in the game’s memory space, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
