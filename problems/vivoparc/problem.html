<p>Vivoparc is a zoological park located in Valencia. It has
    recently added a new area formed by a big plane savanna
    grassland divided into several enclosures.</p>
<p>Our purpose is to assign one animal of the 4 different
    species (lions, leopards, tigers, and panthers) to each of the
    new VivoParc enclosures. These animals are very territorial
    therefore we must be sure that no animal can see other animal
    of its own species from its enclosure. The Vivoparc manager has
    sent us a file with the visibility from the different
    enclosures and we have to assign one species to each enclosure.
    At the end of the process, all the enclosures must have an
    assigned species.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input file contains the number of
    enclosures (<span class="tex2jax_process">$N \leq 100$</span>).
    Each of the following lines contain a visibility restriction:
    1-3 means that animals in enclosure #1 can see animals in
    enclosure #3 and animals in enclosure #3 can see animals in
    enclosure #1. Note that the Vivoparc manager is not a very well
    organized person and therefore, some data appearing in the file
    may be redundant.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output file contains one of all the possible species
    assignation. The file consists of a line per enclosure and each
    line contains the number of the enclosure followed by the
    assigned species (1= Lion, 2= Leopard, 3= Tiger, 4= Panther).
    Enclosures assignation must appear in ascending order.</p>
