</div>In a game of darts a player throws darts at a board
    consisting of 20 different sections labelled <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>. When the dart hits section
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> the player scores
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> points. Each section
    also contains a <em>double</em> area and a <em>triple</em>
    area. When the dart hits the <em>double</em> area of section
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> the player scores
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 i$</span> points, and when the
    dart hits the <em>triple</em> area the player scores
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 i$</span> points, instead of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> points. When throwing
    three darts, the player can therefore score a total of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$180$</span> points by throwing
    all three darts in the triple area of section <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>.

    <p>Given a target score, output at most three throw scores such
    that their sum is equal to the given target score. Note that
    the centre of the dartboard, which is usually called bullseye,
    is not taken into account is this problem.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n \leq 180$</span>), the target
    score.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the target score can be achieved, output at most three
    lines, each of the form “<tt class="ttfamily">single
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span></tt>”, “<tt class="ttfamily">double <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span></tt>”, or “<tt class="ttfamily">triple <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span></tt>”, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> (inclusive), such that the sum of
    these scores is equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Otherwise, output “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”. If there are multiple valid
    answers you may output any of them.</p>
