      SoCCat the Spellcaster is a very magical cat. Currently,
      SoCCat is learning about combination spells!
    </blockquote>
<p>SoCCat has just learned about combination spells, which are
    spells that combine two or more spells from different
    spellcasters to deal more damage.</p>
<p>According to the Unified Theory of Magic, if there are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> spellcasters casting
    spells <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_
    k$</span> respectively, then the combination spell will deal
    damage equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1 \oplus x_2
    \oplus \ldots \oplus x_ k$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$\oplus $</span> is the bitwise XOR
    operation.</p>
<p>SoCCat knew of the famous spellcasting group, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-membered Spellcasters
    of the Round Table. SoCCat also knew that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th member of the group can cast
    spells <span class="tex2jax_process">$0, 1, 2, \ldots , a_
    i$</span>.</p>
<p>Now that SoCCat has learned about combination spells, SoCCat
    wants to know the maximum damage that can be dealt by the
    Spellcasters of the Round Table using a combination spell. Help
    SoCCat calculate the maximum damage!</p>
<h2>Notes</h2>
<p><i class="itshape">Bitwise XOR</i> of two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> can be computed as follows.</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Write <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> in base two with
        the same bit length.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Perform the <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{XOR}$</span> operation for each
        corresponding bit pair:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \; \texttt{XOR} \;
            0 = 0$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \; \texttt{XOR} \;
            1 = 1$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \; \texttt{XOR} \;
            0 = 1$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \; \texttt{XOR} \;
            1 = 0$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convert the <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{XOR}$</span> result back to base
        ten.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As an example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$6 \;
    \texttt{XOR} \; 10 = 12$</span>. Because <span class="tex2jax_process">$6 = 0110$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10=1010$</span> in base two, the bitwise XOR
    obtained is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1100=12$</span> in
    base ten.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, denoting the number
    of test cases (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C \leq
    100$</span>). Each test case has the following format.</p>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, denoting the number of members in
    the Spellcasters of the Round Table (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100$</span>).</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_ n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a_ i \leq
    10^{18}$</span>). The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th integer denotes that the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th member of the
    Spellcasters of the Round Table can cast spells <span class="tex2jax_process">$0, 1, 2, \ldots , a_ i$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output two lines.</p>
<p>The first line of output should contain an integer denoting
    the maximum damage that can be dealt by the Spellcasters of the
    Round Table using a combination spell.</p>
<p>The next line should contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, x_2, \ldots , x_ n$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> is the spell that
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th member of the
    Spellcasters of the Round Table should cast for the combination
    spell to deal the maximum amount of damage (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x_ i \leq a_ i$</span>). If there are
    multiple possible answers, output any one of them.</p>
