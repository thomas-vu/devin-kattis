<p>John Doe wants to transport his possessions from one bank of
    Lake Michigan to the other. His possessions consist of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> wolves, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> sheep, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> cabbages. The transportation will
    be carried out using a boat that can hold up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> of these items at the same time.
    During each step, John can take some items from one bank and
    transfer them to the other bank. Unfortunately, when left
    unsupervised, wolves will eat sheep and sheep will eat cabbages
    (but wolves don’t eat cabbages). John doesn’t want to lose his
    possessions, so he has to devise a scheme such that this
    doesn’t happen. With John present, any combination of items is
    allowed (both on the bank and in the boat). This is also true
    during the loading process. Since John isn’t very good at
    solving problems like this, he asks you to help him.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains a single line with four integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>. The input satisfies the following
    constraints:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 0 \leq W, S,
    C, K \leq 10^6, \]</span><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 1
    \leq max(W, S, C). \]</span>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it’s possible to perform the transportation without the
    loss of items, print <tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt>, otherwise
    print <tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt>.</p>
