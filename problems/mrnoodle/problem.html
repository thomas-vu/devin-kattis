        Chef Mario in his restaurant.
      </div>
</div>Inspired by his visit to UCLA, Mario is attempting to
    launch his new Italian restaurant, “Mr. Noodle”. His specialty
    dish is straight noodles!
    <p>To make the dishes interesting, Mario arranges the straight
    noodles into convex polygon shapes. To serve the dish, Mario
    wants to plate the polygon on the smallest possible plate, for
    aesthetic purposes.</p>
<p>Mario has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> pieces of
    straight noodles, with length <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
    i$</span>, for <span class="tex2jax_process">$i=1, 2, \dots ,
    N$</span>. Find the minimum radius, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, such that there exists a convex
    polygon with side lengths <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
    i$</span> that fits in a circle of radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>. It is guaranteed that there
    exists a non-degenerate convex polygon with side lengths
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3
    \leq N \leq 100,000)$</span>, representing the number of line
    segments. The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> spaced integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \dots , a_ N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq a_ i \leq 10^9)$</span>,
    representing the side lengths of the noodles.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line consisting of a single double <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, the minimum possible radius. The
    answer will be considered correct if the relative difference
    does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
