<p>Congratulations! You are now the judge of a programming
    contest! You’ve been put in charge of a problem, and since your
    problem may not have unique correct output, you’ve got to write
    an output checker for it.</p>
<p>Your problem is called “Good as Goldbach”, and it’s based on
    the Goldbach Conjecture (that any positive even integer greater
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> can be expressed
    as the sum of two primes). A solving program’s output should
    have three numbers separated by whitespace: First, a positive
    even integer greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and less than or equal to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>, and then two
    (positive) prime numbers which sum to the even number.</p>
<p>You must write a checker for this problem. Your checker
    should take the output of a contestant’s program, and determine
    whether or not it could possibly be correct. That is, determine
    if the contestant’s output consists only of three tokens
    separated by whitespace, the first of which is a positive even
    integer greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>
    and less than or equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>, and the next two are positive
    prime integers which sum to the first. The integers should be
    in base ten, with no signs or leading zeros. Any amount of
    white space anywhere except within an integer, including blank
    lines, is OK. Any other output, extra characters, missing
    numbers, etc. should be considered incorrect.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will consist of from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> lines. Each line consists of
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> printable ASCII characters (with
    codes 32 through 126), or tabs.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> if the input could possibly be a
    correct output for the “Good as Goldbach” problem, or
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> if the input could not
    possibly be a correct output for the “Good as Goldbach”
    problem.</p>
