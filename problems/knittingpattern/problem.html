<p>Jörmunrekur had found himself with some extra time on his
    hands, so he decided to try to find a new hobby. After
    discussing this with some of his relatives, his grandparents
    lent him a book with knitting guides and knitting patterns.</p>
<p>He wants to start with something big, so he decides to make
    a sweater. He has also picked out a pattern from the book that
    he will repeat around the circumference of the sweater. He
    wants the pattern to be centered and then repeat out towards
    the back in either direction, but never wants to have less than
    the full pattern on the sweater. He will not place any patterns
    that leaves the placements of patterns asymmetric. Now he has
    to know how much empty space he should leave at the back of the
    sweater to achieve this.</p>
<p>The empty space that is not covered by the patterns must be
    a contiguous (possibly empty) section at the back of the
    sweater.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains two positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the length of the sweater, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, the length of the
    pattern. They satisfy <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq P
    \leq N \leq 10^{18}$</span> and they have the same parity, as
    otherwise the pattern could never be perfectly centered. The
    input is all on one line, with the integers separated by a
    space.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single integer, the amount of empty space left on
    the back of the sweater.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Explanation of samples</h2>
<p>In the first sample the sweater is 13 loops in
    circumference. Thus the centered pattern is placed at loops 6,
    7 and 8. There’s space for another pattern in either direction
    at loops 3, 4, 5 and 9, 10, 11. There’s not enough space to
    place two more, and a single pattern would make things
    asymmetric. Thus loops 1, 2, 12 and 13 are empty, so the answer
    is 4.</p>

<p>In the second sample the sweater is 16 loops in
    circumference. The first pattern is placed at loops 7, 8, 9 and
    10. Two more are placed at 3, 4, 5, 6 and 11, 12, 13, 14. This
    leaves 1, 2, 15 and 16, which exactly fits one more pattern
    that will be perfectly centered at the back of the sweater,
    creating no asymmetry. Thus that pattern is placed, leaving no
    empty space.</p>
