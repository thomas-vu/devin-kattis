</div>The North American Cracker Barrel country store chain
    offers its clientele a peg game to pass the time until their
    food arrives. The game is played on a <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span>-peg board. The rules are simple:
    each move jumps one peg over another peg into a free hole. The
    peg thatâ€™s jumped over is removed. If only one peg remains, the
    player wins. Usually, the game is started with <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span> pegs (and one hole). Pegs may
    have different colors: blue, red, yellow, white, though the
    color of a peg usually does not matter.

    <p>In this problem, you are giving a start position of between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span> pegs of different colors, as well
    as a target color. You should output whether it is possible to
    remove all but one peg from the board using the usual rules and
    end up with a peg that is of the target color.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will contain up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> test cases. Each test contains a
    target peg on a single line, followed by the initial position
    of the board. A peg is represented as a pair of two uppercase
    letters, e.g. <tt class="ttfamily">BB</tt> represents a peg of
    a certain color (say blue). The board is given using
    appropriate indentation of <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> spaces for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1^\text {st}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^\text {nd}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3^\text {rd}$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4^\text {th}$</span> row.</p>
<p>The input will be terminated by a line containing the
    characters <tt class="ttfamily">**</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case print <tt class="ttfamily">Possible</tt>
    if there exists a sequence of valid moves such that all but one
    peg can be removed and you end up with a peg of the given
    target color. Otherwise, print <tt class="ttfamily">Impossible</tt>.</p>
