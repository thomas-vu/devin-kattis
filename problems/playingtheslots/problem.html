<p>The small nation of Erratica prides itself on defying
    conventions established by the more “boring” countries around
    the world. One of their more obvious distinctions lies in the
    design of their coinage. Believing that a person should be
    easily able to identify the value a coin in a pocket or change
    purse by touch alone, Erratica designs its coins as polygons.
    For stability, the coins are convex – there are no notches cut
    into the coins. But the overall shapes themselves can be quite
    irregular.</p>
<p>Erratica Vending, the only manufacturer of vending machines
    in the nation, has been sent the design for a new coin to be
    issued. Their machines are designed so that coins enter through
    a slot into channel shaped as a rectangular prism with the slot
    being an open face of the prism. The channel is narrow because
    the coins are thin, but long enough to contain the entire coin.
    From the outside of the machine, the slot appears as a
    rectangular hole.</p>
<p>The company wants to know what would be the smallest slot
    size they will need so that the new coin can be slipped, after
    some rotation, into the slot.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of sides to the
    polygonal coin, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq N
    \leq 20$</span>.</p>
<p>This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines, each containing two real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, the coordinates of a vertex of
    the polygon, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x, y
    \leq 100$</span>. All real numbers have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> digits after the decimal
    point.</p>
<p>All <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> vertices will
    be distinct, and the vertices will be presented in an order
    proceeding clockwise around the perimeter of the coin.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single line with a real number denoting the minimum
    slot size allowing the coin to pass through. Outputs will be
    accepted that are within <span class="tex2jax_process">$\pm
    0.01$</span> of the judges’ answer.</p>
