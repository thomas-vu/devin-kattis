<div class="problembody">
<p>A deadly virus is sweeping across the globe! You are part of
    an elite group of programmers tasked with tracking the spread
    of the virus. You have been given the timestamps of people
    entering and exiting a room. Now your job is to determine how
    the virus will spread. Hurry up, time is of the essence!</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> people in
    this scenario, numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. Every day, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th person enters and exits the room
    at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> respectively. At
    the beginning of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>st
    day, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> people
    infected with the virus, whose indices will be given in the
    input.</p>
<p>When an infected person comes into contact with an
    uninfected person, the uninfected person will become infected
    at the start of the next day. Hence, they can only start
    spreading the infection from the next day onward. An infected
    person will always remain infected.</p>
<p>Two people are in contact with each other if they are in the
    room at the same time. This includes cases where one person
    leaves and another person enters at the exact same time. Also,
    if a person enters and exits the room at the same time
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> = <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>), they are considered to be in
    contact with everyone in the room at that time. Due to
    safe-distancing requirements, no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> people can be in the room at one
    time.</p>
<p>Your job is to print the indices of the people who will be
    infected after <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> days.
    This includes people who came into contact with an infected
    person on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>th day
    but will only become infected at the start of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$D+1$</span>th day.</p>
<p>Given below are the visualizations for sample inputs
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.</p>

<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth ]{sample.png}" src="/problems/contacttracing/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:90.00%"/>
</center>
<p>Note: In sample <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>,
    person <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> will get infected
    after day <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. They can
    only spread the infection to person <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> on day <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>. For <span class="tex2jax_process">$D = 1$</span>, the infected people are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> had been <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, person <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> would have also been infected.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 20\, 000$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le D \le 50\, 000$</span>,
    the number of people and number of days respectively.</p>
<p>The second line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le C \le N$</span>, the initial number of
    infected people, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> integers, the indices of the
    infected people. Indices are from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    describe the entry and exit times of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> people, in order from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. Each line contains two integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>, the entry and exit time
    respectively. <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le s_ i \le t_
    i \le 10^9$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a list of indices of people infected after
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> days, in ascending
    order. The indices should be all on one line, separated by a
    single space.</p>
