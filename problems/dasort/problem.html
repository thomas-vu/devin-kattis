<div class="problembody">
<p>You recently learned a new way to sort an array of numbers
    in your algorithms course. The algorithm sorts an array of
    numbers by repeatedly performing the <em>Delete-and-Append</em>
    operation. The <em>Delete-and-Append</em> operation consists of
    three steps:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Choose an element from the array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Delete the chosen element from the array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Append the chosen element to the end of the array.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Being a curious student, you wonder what is the minimum
    number of <em>Delete-and-Append</em> operations required to
    sort a given array.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single decimal integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 100$</span>), which is the
    number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be
    processed identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of two or more lines of input. The
    first line contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single space,
    followed by an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 1\, 000$</span>), which is the length of the array to
    sort. The remaining lines in the dataset contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> positive integers that comprise
    the array to be sorted, <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> values per line, except for the
    last line which may have less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> values. All the array elements
    are no larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>.
    The same value may appear more than once in the array to be
    sorted.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is one line of output. The single
    output line consists of the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single space
    followed by an integer which is the minimum number of
    <em>Delete-and-Append</em> operations required to sort the
    array.</p>
