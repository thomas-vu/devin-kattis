</div>The NWERC organisers have decided that they want to
    improve the automatic grading of the submissions for the
    contest, so they now use two systems: DOMjudge and Kattis. Each
    submission is judged by both systems and the grading results
    are compared to make sure that the systems agree. However,
    something went wrong in setting up the connection between the
    systems, and now the jury only knows all results of both
    systems, but not which result belongs to which submission! You
    are therefore asked to help them figure out how many results
    could have been consistent.

    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n \leq 10^5$</span>), the number
        of submissions;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        with a result of the judging by DOMjudge, in arbitrary
        order;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        with a result of the judging by Kattis, in arbitrary
        order.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each result is a string of length between <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> characters (inclusive) consisting
    of lowercase letters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with the maximum number of judging results
    that could have been the same for both systems.</p>
