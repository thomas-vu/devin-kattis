<div class="problembody">
<p>Given a square <span class="tex2jax_process">$n\times
    n$</span> matrix <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, the
    definition of its inverse <span class="tex2jax_process">$B=A^{-1}$</span> is the matrix that fulfills
    the equality:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ AB = I
    \]</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$I$</span> are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n\times n$</span> matrices, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$I$</span> is the identity matrix with ones
    along the diagonal, and zeros everywhere else:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ I = \left[ \begin{matrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp;
    \ldots &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; \ldots &amp; 0 \\ \vdots
    &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp;
    \ldots &amp; 1 \end{matrix} \right] \]</span>
<p>For this problem, you should implement a matrix inverse
    solver for <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\times 2$</span>
    matrices.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each test case is described by two lines of input. Each line
    has two integers with absolute value at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, and the integers given in order
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> represent the values of the matrix
    to invert:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ A = \left[
    \begin{array}{cc} a &amp; b \\ c &amp; d \end{array} \right]
    \]</span>
<p>A blank line follows each test case, and the input is
    terminated by end-of-file. There are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> test cases.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, display the case number followed by two lines
    containing the inverse of the given matrix. Each test case is
    guaranteed to have an inverse (i.e. no matrix is singular), and
    that inverse is integer-valued. Follow the format of the sample
    output.</p>
