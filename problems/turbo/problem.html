<div class="problembody">
<p>Frane has been given the task of sorting an array of
    numbers. The array consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers, each between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (inclusive), with each of those
    appearing exactly once in the array. Frane has come up with the
    following sorting algorithm which operates in <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> phases, and named it
    turbosort:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>In the first phase, the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is moved to position
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> by repeatedly
        swapping consecutive elements.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the second phase, the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is moved to position
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> in the same
        manner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the third phase, the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> is moved to position
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the fourth phase, the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> is moved to position
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And so on...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, when the number of the phase is odd, Frane
    will choose the smallest number not yet chosen, and move it to
    its final position. In even phases he chooses the largest
    number not yet chosen. Write a program which, given the initial
    array, output the number of swaps in each phase of the
    algorithm.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 100\, 000$</span>), the number of elements in the
    array. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains an integer between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (inclusive), the array to be
    sorted. The array will contain no duplicates.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    phases, output the number of swaps on a single line.</p>
