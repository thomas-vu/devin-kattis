<div class="problembody">
<p>It is common for cats to have puncture wounds with different
    severity of infections. To help her local neighbourhood, Doctor
    Kattis decided to open a clinic! However, there are too many
    injured cats that come so she needs to prioritise her
    patients.</p>
<p>Given the names of <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textbf{N}$</span> injured cats, their level
    of severity, and subsequent updates of their infection level,
    determine which cat Doctor Kattis needs to give her most
    attention to.</p>
<p>A cat with higher infection level has higher priority. If
    there are more than one cat with the same infection level,
    Doctor Kattis will give priority to the cat who arrived at the
    clinic first.<br/></p>
<p>There will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> types
    of commands:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>ArriveAtClinic(<i class="itshape">catName</i>, <i class="itshape">infectionLevel</i>): This will be indicated by a
        starting integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
        followed by <i class="itshape">catName</i> and <i class="itshape">infectionLevel</i>, e.g. <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> LUNA <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span>. <i class="itshape">catName</i> is a String that is all UPPERCASE
        with length <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> characters. The
        cat names are all unique. <i class="itshape">infectionLevel</i> is an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$(30 \le $</span> <i class="itshape">infectionLevel</i> <span class="tex2jax_process">$ \le 100)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UpdateInfectionLevel(<i class="itshape">catName</i>,
        <i class="itshape">increaseInfection</i>): This will be
        indicated by a starting integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> followed by <i class="itshape">catName</i> and <i class="itshape">increaseInfection</i>, e.g. <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> LUNA <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>. <i class="itshape">catName</i> is guaranteed to have already arrived
        at clinic. <i class="itshape">increaseInfection</i> is an
        integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0 \le $</span>
<i class="itshape">increaseInfection</i> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\le 70)$</span>. The infection level has
        a maximum value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> and the update infection
        commands are given in such a way that the overall infection
        level of any cat will not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treated(<i class="itshape">catName</i>): This will be
        indicated by a starting integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> followed by <i class="itshape">catName</i>, e.g. <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> KITTY. <i class="itshape">catName</i> is guaranteed to have already arrived
        at the clinic. <i class="itshape">catName</i> leaves the
        clinic after being treated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query(): This will be indicated by a single integer
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. Your job is to
        print the <i class="itshape">catName</i> with the highest
        infection level or “The clinic is empty” if there are no
        more cats.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, denoting the number of commands
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le N \le 1\, 000\,
    000)$</span>. There will be up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$200\, 000$</span> cats. This will be
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> commands
    as described above.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Each time the Query() command is encountered, the <i class="itshape">catName</i> with highest infection level or “The
    clinic is empty” is to be printed in one line.</p>
<h2>Subtasks</h2>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$\textbf{(30
        points)}$</span>: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N
        \le 100$</span>, there will be up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> cats</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$\textbf{(30
        points)}$</span>: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N
        \le 1\, 000\, 000$</span>, there will be up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$200\, 000$</span> cats. However, there
        is no call to UpdateInfectionLevel command and the cat with
        the highest infection level is always the first to be be
        treated, i.e. you can see this as Treated(Query())</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$\textbf{(40
        points)}$</span>: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N
        \le 1\, 000\, 000$</span>, there will be up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$200\, 000$</span> cats. However, there
        will be frequent UpdateInfectionLevel commands and the cat
        with the highest infection level is not always the first to
        be treated</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>In the sample test case, we have <span class="tex2jax_process">$N = 15$</span> commands:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>ArriveAtClinic(“LUNA”, <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ArriveAtClinic(“NALA”, <span class="tex2jax_process">$55$</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ArriveAtClinic(“BELLA”, <span class="tex2jax_process">$42$</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query(). You have to print out “NALA”, as she is
        currently the one with the highest infection level. To be
        precise, at the moment the order is: (NALA, <span class="tex2jax_process">$55$</span>), (BELLA, <span class="tex2jax_process">$42$</span>), (LUNA, <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ArriveAtClinic(“KITTY”, <span class="tex2jax_process">$77$</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query(). Now you have to print out “KITTY”. The current
        order is: (KITTY, <span class="tex2jax_process">$77$</span>), (NALA, <span class="tex2jax_process">$55$</span>), (BELLA, <span class="tex2jax_process">$42$</span>), (LUNA, <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UpdateInfectionLevel(“LUNA”, <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>). After this event, the one
        with the highest infection level is still KITTY with
        <i class="itshape">infectionLevel</i> = <span class="tex2jax_process">$77$</span>. “LUNA” now has infection
        level = <span class="tex2jax_process">$31+24$</span> =
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$55$</span>, but this is
        still <span class="tex2jax_process">$22$</span> smaller
        than “KITTY”. Note that “NALA” also has infection level =
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$55$</span> but “LUNA” is in
        front of “NALA” because “LUNA” arrived at the clinic
        earlier. The current order is: (KITTY, <span class="tex2jax_process">$77$</span>), (LUNA, <span class="tex2jax_process">$55$</span>), (NALA, <span class="tex2jax_process">$55$</span>), (BELLA, <span class="tex2jax_process">$42$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treated(“KITTY”). “KITTY” now has been treated
        ‘instantly’, and “KITTY” leaves Doctor Kattis’s clinic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query(). Now you have to print out “LUNA”, as the
        current order is: (LUNA, <span class="tex2jax_process">$55$</span>), (NALA, <span class="tex2jax_process">$55$</span>), (BELLA, <span class="tex2jax_process">$42$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treated(“BELLA”). “BELLA” leaves Doctor Kattis’s
        clinic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query(). The answer is still: “LUNA”. The current order
        is: (LUNA, <span class="tex2jax_process">$55$</span>),
        (NALA, <span class="tex2jax_process">$55$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treated(“LUNA”). “LUNA” leaves Doctor Kattis’s
        clinic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query(). You have to answer: “NALA”. The current order
        is: (NALA, <span class="tex2jax_process">$55$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Treated(“NALA”). “NALA” leaves Doctor Kattis’s
        clinic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Query(). You have to answer: “The clinic is empty”.</p>
</li>
