<div class="problembody">
<p>You live in Grid City, which is composed of integer-numbered
    streets which run east-west (parallel to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis) and integer-numbered avenues
    which run north-south (parallel to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-axis). The streets and avenues
    have infinite length, and there is a street for every integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-coordinate and an
    avenue for every <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-coordinate. All intersections are
    labelled by their integer coordinates: for example, avenue
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> and street
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-3$</span> intersect at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(7,-3)$</span>.</p>
<p>You drive a special electric car which uses up one unit of
    electrical charge moving between adjacent intersections: that
    is, moving either north or south to the next street, or moving
    east or west to the next avenue). Until your battery runs out,
    at each intersection, your car can turn left, turn right, go
    straight through, or make a U-turn. You may visit the same
    intersection multiple times on the same trip.</p>
<p>Suppose you know your starting intersection, your
    destination intersection and the number of units of electrical
    charge in your battery. Determine whether you can travel from
    the starting intersection to the destination intersection using
    the charge available to you in such a way that your battery is
    empty when you reach your destination.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of three lines. The first line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, indicating the
    starting coordinate <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a,
    b)$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-1000 \le a \le
    1000$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1000 \le b \le
    1000$</span>).</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, indicating the destination
    coordinate <span class="tex2jax_process">$(c, d)$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-1000 \le c \le 1000$</span>;
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1000 \le d \le
    1000$</span>).</p>
<p>The third line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le t \le 10\, 000$</span>) indicating the initial number of
    units of electrical charge of your battery.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <tt class="ttfamily">Y</tt> if it is possible to move
    from the starting coordinate to the destination coordinate
    using exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> units of
    electrical charge. Otherwise output <tt class="ttfamily">N</tt>.</p>
