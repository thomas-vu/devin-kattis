<p>An infinite chessboard is obtained by extending a finite
    chessboard to the right and up infinitely. Each square of the
    chessboard is either black or white with the side length of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> millimeters. The
    leftmost bottom square of the chessboard is black. A flea is
    positioned on the chessboard at the point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span> (given in millimeters) and
    makes jumps by jumping <span class="tex2jax_process">$dx$</span> millimeters to the right and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$dy$</span> millimeters up. That
    is, a flea at position <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,
    y)$</span> after one jump lands at position <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x+dx, y+dy)$</span>.</p>
<p>Given the starting position of the flea on the board your
    task is to find out after how many jumps the flea will reach a
    white square. If the flea lands on a boundary between two
    squares then it does not count as landing on the white square.
    Note that it is possible that the flea never reaches a white
    square.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of multiple test cases, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1024$</span>. Each test case consists of one
    line of input containing five integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$dx$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$dy$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le S \le 1000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x,
    y \le 10^6$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le dx, dy
    \le 10^6$</span>). An input line containing five zeroes follows
    the last test case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case print one line of output in the format
    shown in the sample.</p>
