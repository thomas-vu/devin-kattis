<p>You have recently acquired a new job at the Bank for
    Acquiring Peculiar Currencies. Here people can make payments,
    and deposit or withdraw money in all kinds of strange
    currencies. At your first day on the job you help a customer
    from Nijmegia, a small insignificant country famous for its
    enormous coins with values equal to powers of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, that is, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 10, 100, 1000$</span>, etc. This customer
    wants to make a rather large payment, and you are not looking
    forward to the prospect of carrying all those coins to and from
    the vault.</p>
<p>You therefore decide to think things over first. You have an
    enormous supply of Nijmegian coins in reserve, as does the
    customer (most citizens from Nijmegia are extremely strong).
    You now want to minimize the total number of coins that are
    exchanged, in either direction, to make the exact payment the
    customer has to make.</p>
<p>For example, if the customer wants to pay <span class="tex2jax_process">$83$</span> coins there are many ways to make
    the exchange. Here are three possibilities:</p>
<dl class="description">
<dt>Option 1.</dt>
<dd>
<p>The customer pays <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> coins of value <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> coins of value <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. This requires exchanging
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$8 + 3 = 11$</span>
        coins.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Option 2.</dt>
<dd>
<p>The customer pays a coin of value <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, and you return a coin of
        value <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> coins of value
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. This requires
        exchanging <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 + 1 + 7 =
        9$</span> coins.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Option 3.</dt>
<dd>
<p>The customer pays a coin of value <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> coins of value <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. You return <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> coins of value <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. This requires exchanging
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 + 3 + 2 = 6$</span>
        coins.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>It turns out the last way of doing it requires the least
    coins possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>A single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq n
        &lt; 10^{1000}$</span>, the amount the customer from
        Nijmegia has to pay.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Output the minimum number of coins that have to be
        exchanged to make the required payment.</p>
</li>
</ul>
