<p>At the end of every programming contest, statistics and fun
    facts are collected to show the contestants afterwards. Often
    average number of solves, or average number of tries to solve a
    given problem are calculated. Allegedly, someone at the
    statistics department said that arithmetic averages are very
    uninteresting. To make the contest data analysis exciting
    enough for the statisticians the contest hosts have decided to
    use a new exciting method to calculate averages. Instead of
    following the good example set by HÃ¶lder in how to generalise
    averages, the example of Randall Munroe is followed instead.
    That is where the geothmetic meandian comes in. As the image
    shows, the geothmetic meandian is calculated in the following
    way:</p>
<p>Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> be an odd
    number. A sequence of numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, x_2, \dots , x_n$</span> is sorted
    resulting in the sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1,
    y_2, \dots , y_n$</span>. The original sequence is then
    replaced by the sequence</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    n^{-1}\sum _{i = 1}^n y_i, \sqrt[n]{\prod _{i=1}^n y_i},
    y_{(n+1)/2} \]</span>
<p>This is then repeated on the new sequence resulting in
    another sequence. If the repetition is performed infinitely
    often the sequence converges to a single repeated value, this
    repeated value is then the geothmetic meandian.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with a single odd integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$</span>. The next line
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> real values
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, \dots , x_n$</span>. For
    all <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> it is guaranteed
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; x_i \leq
    10^9$</span>. All real values have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> digits after the decimal.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the geothmetic meandian of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, \dots , x_n$</span>. The answer is
    considered correct if its absolute or relative error from the
    true answer is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span>.</p>
