<div class="problembody">
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> crates
    waiting to be loaded onto a ship. The crates are numbered
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \ldots , n$</span>, the
    numbers determining the order of loading. Unfortunately,
    someone messed up the transit and the crates are standing in a
    row in an arbitrary order. As there is only limited space in
    the dock area, you must sort the crates by swapping some of
    them.</p>
<p>You are given a crane that works in the following way: you
    select a connected interval of crates of even length. The crane
    then exchanges the first half of the interval with the second
    half. The order inside both halves remains unchanged. Determine
    the sequence of crane moves that reorders the crates
    properly.</p>
<p>The crane’s software has a bug: the move counter is a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>-based (not
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>-based, as you might
    think) integer with at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> digits. Therefore, the crane stops
    working (and has to be serviced) after <span class="tex2jax_process">$9^6 = 531441$</span> moves. Your solution
    must fit within this limit.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the number of test cases
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 8$</span>. The descriptions of
    the test cases follow:</p>
<p>Each test case starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 10\, 000$</span>, denoting the number of crates. In
    the next line a permutation of numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n\} $</span> follows.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case print a single line containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> – the number of swaps
    – followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
    describing the swaps in the order in which they should be
    performed. A single swap is described by two numbers – the
    indices of the first and the last element in the interval to be
    exchanged. Do not follow the crane’s strange software design –
    use standard decimal numeral system.</p>
