</div>Carl likes to ride the carousel. Carousel operators often
    offer discounts for buying multiple rides. He wonders which of
    the discounts provides the best value. Write a program to help
    him.

    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will contain multiple test cases, up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>. A test case starts
    with a line containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 10$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le m \le 20$</span>). Carl will not take advantage of offers
    that require him to buy more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> tickets. Following this are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each with
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> which each represent
    an offer to buy <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
    tickets for <span class="tex2jax_process">$\$ b$</span>.</p>
<p>The input will be terminated by a line containing the
    characters <tt class="ttfamily">0 0</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print <tt class="ttfamily">Buy a tickets
    for $b</tt> for the best offer that matches his requirements.
    If there are multiple best offers, print the one which buys
    more tickets. If there is no suitable offer, print <tt class="ttfamily">No suitable tickets offered</tt>.</p>
