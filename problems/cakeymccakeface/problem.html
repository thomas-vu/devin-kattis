<p>Cakey McCakeFace’s signature pastry, the Unknowable Cake, is
    baked daily in their Paris facility. The make-or-break trick
    for this cake is the cooking time, which is a very well-kept
    secret. Eve, the well-known spy, wants to steal this secret,
    and your job is to help her.</p>
<p>Cakes are cooked in a single huge oven that has exactly one
    front and one back door. The uncooked cakes are inserted
    through the front door. After the exact and very secret cooking
    time has passed, the cakes exit the oven through the back door.
    Only one cake can go through the front or back door at any
    given time.</p>
<p>Eve has secretly installed detectors at the front and back
    of the oven. They record a signal every time a cake passes
    through the doors. A cake will therefore trigger the entry
    detector at some time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>
    when it goes through the front door, and then trigger the exit
    detector exactly at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> + <em>cooking_time</em> when it
    goes through the back door (all cakes at Cakey McCakeFace are
    always perfectly cooked).</p>
<p>After a few days, she receives two sets of timestamps (in
    ms) corresponding to entry and exit detectors. Unfortunately,
    the detectors are faulty: they are sometimes triggered when no
    cake has passed, or they may fail to be triggered when a cake
    passes. Eve noticed that she could make a good guess of the
    secret <em>cooking_time</em> by finding the time difference
    that maximizes the number of correspondences of entry and exit
    detection times. Help Eve compute this.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">Line 1:</b> the number
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> of times the entry
        detector was triggered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">Line 2:</b> the number
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> of times the exit
        detector was triggered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">Line 3:</b> the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integer timestamps at which
        the entry detector was triggered, sorted in ascending
        order, with no repetition, space-separated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">Line 4:</b> the <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> integer timestamps at which
        the exit detector was triggered, sorted in ascending order,
        with no repetition, space-separated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Limits</h3>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N,M \leq 2\,
        000$</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>each timestamp is between 0 and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 000$</span>
        (inclusive).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>A single integer: your best guess of the secret
    <em>cooking_time</em>, the (positive or zero) time difference
    that maximizes the number of correspondences of entry and exit
    detection times. If multiple such values exist, the smallest
    one should be returned.</p>
