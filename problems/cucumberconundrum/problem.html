</div>Maj loves pickled cucumber (also known as
    <em>pickles</em>). However, her partner is not as keen on
    filling a sandwich with pickles. Maj would like to maximize the
    amount of pickles on a sandwich, while still avoiding being
    judged by her partner.

    <p>Both Majâ€™s sandwich and the pickles have a circular shape.
    The sandwich has radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> cm and the pickles have radius
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> cm.</p>
<p>Maj has exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    pickles. She wants to place as many of them as possible on her
    sandwich, as long as:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$z \% $</span> of
        the area of the sandwich is covered by pickles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no two pickles overlap (but they are allowed to
        touch).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>How many pickles can Maj place on her sandwich?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with the decimal numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le s \le 10$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.5 \le r \le s$</span>, at most
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> digits after the
        decimal point), the radius of the sandwich and the radius
        of a pickle, in centimetres.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 7$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le z \le 100$</span>), the number of
        pickles Maj have, and the maximum area she may cover with
        them, in percent.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum number of pickles Maj can place on her
    sandwich. The input will always be constructed such that this
    number does not change if the radius of the sandwich increases
    or decreases by <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
