<p>You have been assigned the task of ordering and preparing a
    report for a British major. This major does mathematics
    research in his spare time, so he appreciates patterns and
    sequences in everything he sees. When he recieves a stack of
    papers he likes to consider the index of the stack. Each page
    has some information on it, and this info is of varying
    importance. This index is calculated by going through the stack
    from top to bottom and adding up all the page numbers where the
    page is more important than the one following it. So if the
    third page he reads is more important then the fourth he adds
    three to the index. Can you order the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> pages of the report so its index
    is <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, the major’s
    favourite number?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of pages,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq
    10^5$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, the
    major’s favourite number, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq k \leq \frac{n \cdot
    (n-1)}{2}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \dots
    , n$</span> in some order on a single line, separated by
    spaces. The first number denotes the page the major will read
    first and the last number the page he will read last. The least
    important page is denoted by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, the second least important page
    is denoted by <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and so
    on, up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, which
    denotes the most important page. Your output is considered
    correct if the stack it represents has the index <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>.</p>
<p>For example, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=5$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k=4$</span>, then the output
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 2 4 1 3$</span> is considered
    correct, since the first and third page are more important than
    the one that follows, so the index is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1+3=4$</span>.</p>
