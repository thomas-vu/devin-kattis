<div class="problembody">
<p>You are an expert on the most difficult field of math —
    primes! Indeed, you have actually proven the Riemann
    Hypothesis, but unfortunately, this margin is too narrow to
    contain the proof.</p>
<p>Being considered a prime expert, <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> people have come to you for help.
    The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th person has a
    favorite number <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>,
    and they want to find the <em>primmest</em> prime number with
    respect to <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> — that
    is, the smallest prime number <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> such that <b class="bfseries">both
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i + p$</span> are prime</b>!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are too many people, and you don’t want
    to spend your time answering such trivial questions. Instead,
    you decide to write a program to answer all of their
    questions!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>, denoting the number of people
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq q \leq 100$</span>).</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines each
    contain an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>,
    denoting the favorite number of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th person (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x_ i \leq 10^{18}$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines, where
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line contains
    the <em>primmest prime</em> <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> with respect to <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>. If there is no such prime
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> where both
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i + p$</span> are primes, output
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> instead.</p>
