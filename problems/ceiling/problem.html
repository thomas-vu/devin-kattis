<p>Advanced Ceiling Manufacturers (ACM) is analyzing the
    properties of its new series of Incredibly Collapse-Proof
    Ceilings (ICPCs). An ICPC consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> layers of material, each with a
    different value of collapse resistance (measured as a positive
    integer). The analysis ACM wants to run will take the
    collapse-resistance values of the layers, store them in a
    binary search tree, and check whether the shape of this tree in
    any way correlates with the quality of the whole construction.
    Because, well, why should it not?</p>
<p>To be precise, ACM takes the collapse-resistance values for
    the layers, ordered from the top layer to the bottom layer, and
    inserts them one-by-one into a tree. The rules for inserting a
    value <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> are:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If the tree is empty, make <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> the root of the tree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the tree is not empty, compare <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> with the root of the tree. If
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> is smaller, insert
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> into the left
        subtree of the root, otherwise insert <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> into the right subtree.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>ACM has a set of ceiling prototypes it wants to analyze by
    trying to collapse them. It wants to take each group of ceiling
    prototypes that have trees of the same shape and analyze them
    together.</p>
<p>For example, assume ACM is considering five ceiling
    prototypes with three layers each, as described by Sample
    Input 1 and shown in Figure 1. Notice that the first
    prototype’s top layer has collapse-resistance value 2, the
    middle layer has value 7, and the bottom layer has
    value 1. The second prototype has layers with
    collapse-resistance values of 3, 1, and 4 – and yet these
    two prototypes induce the same tree shape, so ACM will analyze
    them together.</p>
<p>Given a set of prototypes, your task is to determine how
    many different tree shapes they induce.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 50$</span>), which is the number
    of ceiling prototypes to analyze, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le k \le 20$</span>), which is the number of layers in each of
    the prototypes.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    describe the ceiling prototypes. Each of these lines contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> distinct integers
    (between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span>, inclusive), which
    are the collapse-resistance values of the layers in a ceiling
    prototype, ordered from top to bottom.</p>
