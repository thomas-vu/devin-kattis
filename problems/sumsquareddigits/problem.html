<p>The <em>Sum Squared Digits</em> function, <span class="tex2jax_process">$SSD(b, n)$</span> of a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, in base <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> is defined by representing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> in base <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> as in:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ n = a_0 + a_1 * b + a_2 * b^2 + \ldots
    \]</span>
<p>then:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ SSD(b, n) = a_0^2
    + a_1^2 + a_2^2 + \ldots \]</span>
<p>is the sum of squares of the digits of the
    representation.</p>
<p>Write a program to compute the <em>Sum Squared Digits</em>
    function of an input positive number.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single decimal integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 1\, 000$</span>), which is the
    number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be
    processed identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by the base,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le b \le 16$</span>) as a decimal
    integer, followed by the positive integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (as a decimal integer) for which
    the Sum Squared Digits function is to be computed with respect
    to the base <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> will fit in a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span> bit unsigned integer.
    The data set number <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    starts at <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and is
    incremented by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> for
    each data set.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is a single line of output.</p>
<p>The single line of output consists of the data set number,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single
    space followed by the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$SSD(b, n)$</span> as a decimal integer.</p>
