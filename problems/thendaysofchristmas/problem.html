<p>Consider the first three verses of the classic Christmas
    carol, <em>The Twelve Days of Christmas:</em></p>
<blockquote class="verse">
<p>On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me<br/>
      A partridge in a pear tree.</p>
<p>On the second day of Christmas my true love gave to me<br/>
      Two turtle doves,<br/>
      And a partridge in a pear tree.</p>
<p>On the third day of Christmas my true love gave to me<br/>
      Three French hens,<br/>
      Two turtle doves,<br/>
      And a partridge in a pear tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The carol continues this pattern for a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> days. On the <span class="tex2jax_process">$d^\textrm {th}$</span> day, you receive
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> copies of a new kind
    of gift, along with <span class="tex2jax_process">$(d-1)$</span> copies of the gift introduced
    on the previous day, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(d-2)$</span> copies of the gift introduced
    the day before that, and so on. This raises some interesting
    questions:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>How many gifts do you receive on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$12^{\textrm{th}}$</span> day?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the total number of gifts you have received by
        the end of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$12^{\textrm{th}}$</span> day?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>But why should the Christmas season be limited to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> days? If your goal is
    to get as many gifts as possible (clearly a noble aspiration),
    then it is advantageous to generalize <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> to an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N,$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> can be as large as the number of
    days in a year <span class="tex2jax_process">$(366$</span> for
    a leap year).</p>
<p>Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, what are the
    answers to the generalized versions of the two questions
    above?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of days of Christmas
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq N \leq 366).$</span></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two lines, the first of which contains the number of
    gifts you receive on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N^{\textrm{th}}$</span> day, and the second
    of which contains the total number of gifts you have received
    by the end of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N^{\textrm{th}}$</span> day.</p>
