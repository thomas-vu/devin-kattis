<div class="problembody">
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> boxes,
    indexed by a number from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. Each box may (or not may not) be
    put into other boxes. These boxes together form a tree
    structure (or a forest structure, to be precise).</p>
<p>You have to answer a series of queries of the following
    form: given a list of indices of the boxes, find the total
    number of boxes that the list of boxes actually contain.</p>
<p>Consider, for example, the following five boxes.</p>

</center>
</div>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If the query is the list “1”, then the correct answer is
        “5”, because box 1 contains all boxes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the query is the list “4 5”, then the correct answer
        is “2”, for boxes 4 and 5 contain themselves and nothing
        else.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the query is the list “3 4”, then the correct answer
        is “2”.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the query is the list “2 3 4”, then the correct
        answer is “4”, since box 2 also contains box 5.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the query is the list “2”, then the correct answer is
        “3”, because box 2 contains itself and two other boxes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 200\, 000$</span>), the number of boxes.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>­integers. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th integer is either the index of
    the box which contains the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th box, or zero if the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th box is not contained in any
    other box.</p>
<p>The third line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq Q \leq 100\, 000$</span>), the number of queries. The
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines will
    have the following format: on each line, the first integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq 20$</span>) is the length of
    the list of boxes in this query, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> integers follow, representing the
    indices of the boxes.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query, output a line which contains an integer
    representing the total number of boxes.</p>
