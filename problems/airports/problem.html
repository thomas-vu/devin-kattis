<div class="problembody">
<p>An airline company offers flights out of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> airports. The flight time between
    any given pair of airports is known, but may differ on
    direction due to things like wind or geography. Upon landing at
    a given airport, a plane must be inspected before it can be
    flown again. This inspection time is dependent on the airport
    at which the inspection is taking place.</p>
<p>Given a set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    flights that the airline company must realize, determine the
    minimum number of planes that the company needs to purchase.
    The airline may add unscheduled flights to move the airplanes
    around if that would reduce the total number of planes
    needed.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that
    your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The
    first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le n, m \le 500$</span>). The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space-separated nonnegative
    integers less than or equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span>, where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> integer denotes the
    amount of time (in minutes) that an inspection takes at airport
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    space-separated nonnegative integers less than or equal to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span>. On the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> line, The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{\text {th}}$</span> integer
    indicates the amount of time it takes to fly from airport
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to airport
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>. It takes no time to
    fly from an airport to itself. Note that the flight time from
    airport <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> is not necessarily the
    same as the flight time from airport <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
    contain three space-separated integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le s, f \le n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s \ne
    f$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le t \le
    10^6)$</span> indicating that a flight must start at airport
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, end at airport
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>, and fly out from
    airport <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> at exactly
    time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> heading directly
    to airport <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single positive integer indicating the minimum
    number of planes the airline company must purchase in order to
    realize the <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> requested
    flights.</p>
