<div class="problembody">
<p>Nathaniel collects rare gems and minerals, and has decided
    he has to protect his valuable collection from thieves. He is
    installing an electric eye system, in which he shines a laser
    into the room with his collection, and the laser will hit a
    sensor as long as no one steps in a spot that the laser
    crosses. Unfortunately, he spent most of his money on his
    collection, so he has only one laser and one sensor, and some
    mirrors. He has installed the mirrors at various locations in
    the room, at <span class="tex2jax_process">$45$</span> degree
    angles to the walls. At the point you have been called in to
    help, he has only one more mirror left to install, and he wants
    to know if there is any way to place it such that the laser
    will reach the sensor (as long as no one is in its way).</p>
<p>We will assume that the room is always square, the laser is
    always in the northern wall pointing south, and the sensor is
    mounted on the eastern wall, such that the laser must hit it
    from the west. We will also assume that the interior of the
    room can be represented by a grid, and that all mirrors
    (including the one to be added) are placed at the center of
    grid cells, at <span class="tex2jax_process">$45$</span>
    degrees with respect to the grid axis, and that the laser and
    sensor are at the center of their respective column/row of the
    grid.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains three integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the size of the room,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, the column number of
    the laser (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq c\leq
    n$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, the
    row number of the sensor (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq
    r\leq n$</span>). This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> characters separated
    by spaces. The character <tt class="tt">.</tt> represents an
    empty space, the character <tt class="tt">\</tt> represents a
    mirror oriented NW/SE and the character <tt class="tt">/</tt>
    represents a mirror oriented NE/SW. You may assume <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 2\, 000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq r,c\leq n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should consist of the string <tt class="tt">YES</tt> if the laser can be made to hit the sensor with
    the addition of at most one mirror, or the string <tt class="tt">NO</tt> otherwise.</p>
