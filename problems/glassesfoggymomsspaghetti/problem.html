        Conway loves being able to see!
      </div>

<p><i class="itshape">Conway’s glasses are foggy,<br/>
    Knees weak, arms are heavy.<br/>
    Palms are sweaty, mom’s spaghetti.<br/>
    He’s nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready<br/>
    to go home neat and tidy, but the streets are trippy.</i></p>
<p>In order to go home, Conway needs to follow the street sign
    that is straight in front of him (not to the left/right).
    Trying to see the sign, he raises his head by an angle,
    aligning the center of the lenses to the center of the road
    sign, where the lens is always perpendicular to the line of
    sight. Unfortunately, Conway’s glasses are foggy so he needs to
    wipe his lenses with his trusty microfiber cloth. Conway can
    only see through the clear areas on the lens, and thus he wants
    to know the height of his glasses lens so he knows how much he
    needs to wipe.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: An example of the scenario is shown on
          the left. The dotted line represents the line of sight.
          The green region on the lens represents the clear region
          on the lens. The scenario on the left can be abstracted
          to the diagram on the right.

<p>Given the following information, find the height of the
    smallest area he needs to wipe before he can see the entire
    sign (the minimum length of the green line segment).</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Distance from the pupil to the lenses: <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Horizontal distance from the pupil to the road sign:
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vertical distance from the pupil to the center of the
        road sign: <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>
        units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vertical size of the road sign: <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> units.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of four space separated integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>. It’s guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; d &lt; x &lt; 10\, 000$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq y &lt; 10\, 000$</span>,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; h &lt; 10\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one number, the minimum required height of the clear
    area on the lens. Your answer will be considered correct if the
    absolute or relative error does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
