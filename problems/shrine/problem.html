<div class="problembody">
<p>A religious sect has holy sites with shrines placed around a
    circle of radius 1000. The circle is split into <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> equal length arcs and the
    endpoints are numbered in order, 1 through <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. The first figure shows a circle
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is 12, with 12
    gray tick marks like on a 12-hour analog clock. We can imagine
    the marks numbered, as on a clock, with 12 at the top. Each
    circle has one or more sacred numbers associated with it. The
    sacred numbers for the circle in the first figure are 2 and 3.
    A shrine, indicated by a black dot in the figure, is placed at
    each mark whose number is a multiple of at least one of the
    sacred numbers, so in this case the shrines are at positions 2,
    3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 12.</p>

<p>When it comes time to inspect and repair the shrines at a
    given site, the area is closed and a team of workers
    simultaneously fan out from a maintenance shed, located in the
    center of the circle, so that each shrine is visited by at
    least one worker. Once all workers have returned to the shed,
    the site is reopened to the public. Because these sites are in
    great demand, it is important that they be closed as briefly as
    possible. In order to minimize this time, they must figure out
    how to apportion the shrines among the current number of
    workers, so the maximum distance traveled by any one worker is
    as small as possible. Figure 1 shows one choice for the optimal
    solution paths for 3 workers. The lower left path has darker
    lines, to indicate that it is one with the longest length,
    which in this case is approximately 3517.6.</p>
<p>This sect has many circular sites with multiple shrines. The
    number of available workers at a site, <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>, the value of the number equal
    arcs, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, and the sacred
    numbers vary between sites. The sacred numbers are always
    divisors of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. Your job
    is to help figure out how much time is required for
    maintenance. Figures 2 and 3 show optimal solutions for other
    sites.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is composed of <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leqslant T \leqslant 30$</span>).</p>
<p>Each test case is on a single line and consists entirely of
    positive integers. The first three entries are <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>, the number of workers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of equal
    arcs around the circle, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>, the number of sacred divisors of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. At the end come the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> divisors of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> is no more than the total number
    of shrines; <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \leqslant
    8600$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$D \leqslant
    6$</span>; each listed divisor of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is smaller than <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<p>A single zero, <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>, will be placed
    on the last line to indicate the end of the input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output is a single line for each test case: the maximum
    distance a worker must travel with an optimal assignment of the
    shrines. This number is displayed so that it is rounded to one
    decimal place, and always shows that decimal place, even if it
    is 0. To ensure unique answers with double arithmetic, the test
    cases are chosen so that if your answer is anywhere within .005
    of the exact minimum distance, then the answer rounded to one
    decimal place will be the same.</p>
<p>The first three sample test cases correspond to the three
    figures.</p>
<p>Caution: Be careful with your algorithm so it finishes
    rapidly.</p>
