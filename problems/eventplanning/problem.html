</div>As you didn’t show up to the yearly general meeting of
    the Nordic Club of Pin Collectors, you were unanimously elected
    to organize this years excursion to Pin City. You are free to
    choose from a number of weekends this autumn, and have to find
    a suitable hotel to stay at, preferably as cheap as possible.

    <p>You have some constraints: The total cost of the trip must
    be within budget, of course. All participants must stay at the
    same hotel, to avoid last years catastrophe, where some members
    got lost in the city, never being seen again.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of four integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 200$</span>, the
    number of participants, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq B
    \leq 500\, 000$</span>, the budget, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq H \leq 18$</span>, the number of
    hotels to consider, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq W
    \leq 13$</span>, the number of weeks you can choose between.
    Then follow two lines for each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> hotels. The first gives
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p \leq 10\, 000$</span>,
    the price for one person staying the weekend at the hotel. The
    second contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a \leq 1\,
    000$</span>, giving the number of available beds for each
    weekend at the hotel.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum cost of the stay for your group, or
    “<tt class="ttfamily">stay home</tt>” if nothing can be found
    within the budget.</p>
