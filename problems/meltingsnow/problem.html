<div class="problembody">
<p>The snowfall in Alberta is setting records this year. At the
    beginning of every single day, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> centimeters of snow falls. At the
    end of every single day, <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> percent of the snow currently on
    the ground melts. As a member of the Alberta Consecutive
    Precipitation Calculation (ACPC) committee, you have been
    tasked with calculating the maximum amount of snow that will
    ever be on the ground. You know already that the ground starts
    with no snow on it and this pattern of snow will continue
    forever.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq S \leq 10^5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq
    P \leq 100$</span>). <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>
    indicates the daily amount of snowfall in centimeters.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> indicates the
    percentage of snow that melts at the end of each day.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single floating-point value equal to the maximum
    amount of snow in centimeters that will ever appear on the
    ground. The restrictions on the input guarantee that this
    number cannot be infinite. Your answer will be considered
    correct if it is within a relative or absolute error of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> of the correct
    answer.</p>
