<p>All the cool kids in town want to become a member of the
    Bots and Androids Programmer Club (BAPC). To become a member of
    the club, applicants must show a feat of their skills with a
    home-made robot that is programmed to perform some tricks. Just
    like your older brother, you want to become a member of the
    BAPC, so it’s time to lock yourself in the hobby basement and
    start building some robots!</p>
<p>Since your older brother has used up almost all of the parts
    for his own projects at the BAPC, you will have to get creative
    with whatever is still left. You find a robotic arm that has
    only a single purpose: fitting circle-shaped objects into
    square-shaped holes. Not exactly what you had in mind, but it
    will have to do. After all, you only have five hours left to
    apply for your BAPC membership.</p>
<p>The memory chip of the robotic arm seems to be wiped, but
    luckily you do know the programming interface of its ARM
    processor. Firstly, the robotic arm only supports integer
    coordinates. Secondly, when the arm picks up a circle-shaped
    object, you need to calculate the smallest possible square that
    it could fit the object in, after which it will autonomically
    find a suitable square-shaped hole.</p>
<p>Given the location of a circle-shaped object, calculate the
    smallest possible square which encloses the object.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^9\leq x,y\leq 10^9$</span>), the
        coordinates of the center of the circle.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq r\leq 10^9$</span>), the radius of
        the circle.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output four lines, each line containing two integers,
    representing the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>- and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-coordinates of one of
    the corners of the square. The coordinates should be printed in
    either clockwise or counter-clockwise order.</p>
<p>If there are multiple valid solutions, you may output any
    one of them.</p>
