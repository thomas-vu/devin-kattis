</div>The English word “mile” derives from the Latin “mille
    passus”, meaning “a thousand paces”. A Roman mile was the
    distance a soldier would walk in <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> paces (a pace being two
    steps, one with each foot).
    <p>Over time, the actual distance referred to as a “mile” has
    changed. The modern English mile is <span class="tex2jax_process">$5\, 280$</span> (modern) feet. The Roman
    mile is believed to have been about <span class="tex2jax_process">$4\, 854$</span> (modern) feet. Therefore a
    distance of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> English
    miles would correspond to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\,
    000 \cdot \frac{5\, 280}{4\, 854}$</span> Roman paces.</p>
<p>Write a program to convert distances in English miles into
    Roman paces.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input will consist of a single line containing a single real
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le X \le 1\,
    000$</span> denoting a distance in English miles. The number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> has at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> digits of precision
    after the decimal point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print an integer denoting the closest number of Roman paces
    equivalent to X. Your answer should be rounded to the closest
    integer (with an exact <span class="tex2jax_process">$.5$</span> decimal part rounded up).</p>
