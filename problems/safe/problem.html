</div>Your little sister misplaced the code for her toy safe -
    can you help her?

    <p>This particular safe has <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> buttons with digital displays.
    Each button shows a single digit in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$0..3$</span>. When you push one of the
    buttons, the number it displays is incremented by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, circling around from <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. However, pushing a button will
    also increment the other digits in the same row and the same
    column as the button pushed.</p>
<p>The safe opens when the display shows nine zeros.</p>
<p>For instance, if you pushed the top-left, center, center,
    and middle-right buttons, in this order, the safe’s display
    would change like so:</p>
<pre>
3 1 2     0 2 3     0 3 3     0 0 3     0 0 0
0 1 1  -&gt; 1 1 1  -&gt; 2 2 2  -&gt; 3 3 3  -&gt; 0 0 0
3 2 3     0 2 3     0 3 3     0 0 3     0 0 0
</pre>
<p>Write a program to determine if the safe can be opened, and
    if so, how many button pushes it would take!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a single test case, given as <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> digits <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le d \le 3$</span>) on <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> lines, representing the digits
    that are initially displayed on the safe’s buttons. Your
    program will be run multiple times on different inputs.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of times buttons need to be pushed to open
    the safe! (The same button may need to be pushed more than
    once, and you do not have to output which buttons must be
    pushed.) If the safe cannot be opened, output <tt class="ttfamily">-1</tt>.</p>
