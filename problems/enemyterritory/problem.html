<div class="problembody">
<p>A small group of commandos has infiltrated deep into enemy
    territory. They have just accomplished their mission and now
    have to return to their rendezvous point. Of course they don’t
    want to get caught even if the mission is already over.
    Therefore they decide to take the route that will keep them as
    far away from any enemy base as possible.</p>
<p>Being well prepared for the mission, they have a detailed
    map of the area which marks all (known) enemy bases, their
    current position and the rendezvous point. For simplicity, we
    view the the map as a rectangular grid with integer coordinates
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x &lt; X$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le y &lt; Y$</span>.
    Furthermore, we approximate movements as horizontal and
    vertical steps on this grid, so we use Manhattan distance:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text {dist}((x_1,y_1), (x_2,
    y_2)) = |x_2 - x_1| + |y_2 - y_1|$</span>. The commandos can
    only travel in vertical and horizontal directions at each
    step.</p>
<p>Can you help them find the best route? Of course, in case
    that there are multiple routes that keep the same minimum
    distance to enemy bases, the commandos want to take a shortest
    route that does so. Furthermore, they don’t want to take a
    route off their map as it could take them in unknown, dangerous
    areas, but you don’t have to worry about unknown enemy bases
    off the map.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains a single test case, consisting of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with three positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 10\, 000$</span> is the
        number of enemy bases and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
        \le X, Y \le 1\, 000$</span> the size of the map:
        coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span>
        are on the map if <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x
        &lt; X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le y &lt;
        Y$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing two pairs of integer coordinates
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ r$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ r$</span>: the initial position of
        the commandos and the rendezvous point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each
        containing one pair of integer coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> of an enemy base. All pairs of
        coordinates are on the map and different from each
        other.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with two numbers separated by one space: the
        minimum separation from an enemy base and the length of the
        route.</p>
</li>
</ul>
