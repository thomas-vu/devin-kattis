<p>One year ago astronauts Alice and Bob set off to explore the
    galaxy each going their own way. The time has finally come for
    them to reunite and share their findings. Luckily they have set
    up a series of “hyper tunnels” between the planets they’ve
    visited. Each hyper tunnel consists of two “gates” (one on each
    planet). Entering a gate will transport them to the
    corresponding gate instantly! However, using a hyper tunnel
    costs a fixed amount of energy from their space suit. As such
    they agree to meet halfway to keep the energy drain as even as
    possible. Given Alice and Bob’s starting planets and the hyper
    tunnel system they’ve set up, determine the minimum number of
    hyper tunnels Alice and Bob will have to take.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line will contain 2 space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2
    \leq n, m \leq 10\, 000)$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of planets connected
    to the hyper tunnel system and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number of hyper tunnels.
    The second line will contain 2 space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq p_ A, p_ B &lt; n$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ A \neq p_ B$</span>) which
    are the planets Alice and Bob start at respectively. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines will contain 2
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq p_1, p_2 &lt; n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1 \neq p_2$</span>) denoting that there is
    a hyper tunnel connecting planets <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_2$</span>. No two hyper tunnels will
    connect the same pair of planets.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> is the larger of the number of
    hyper tunnels Alice or Bob will take (i.e. if one took 3
    tunnels and the other took 4, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$t=4$</span>). It is always possible for them
    to meet by using the hyper tunnels.</p>
