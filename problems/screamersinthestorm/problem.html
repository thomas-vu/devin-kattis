<p>On Mars, though its atmosphere is very thin, winds can blow
    with unexpected force. The effect can grow even stronger in
    narrow and deep canyons close to the equator. The floor of one
    of these canyons is extremely flat and it is used for transport
    because its steep walls provide partial shielding from cosmic
    radiation. Over the time, sand has accumulated in the canyon.
    It is blown by the wind into sizeable sand dunes which obstruct
    the transport. The dunes form one long string of dunes
    stretched along the canyon floor.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the dunes is not stable. Raging sand
    storms often remodel the dunes into a different string. Violent
    movement of sand masses in the storm produce an eerie sound for
    which the dunes are known as “Screamers in the storm”.</p>
<p>Detailed measurements of the dunes revealed that the height
    of adjacent dunes, expressed in Martian meters, is always a
    small positive integer. Moreover, probably due to wind
    interference effects in the canyon, the heights of two adjacent
    dunes are different, unless they are both <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<p>In fact, the heights of two adjacent dunes are always
    relatively prime, that is, they share no common factor bigger
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<p>To model the dunes behavior, the number of all possible
    configurations of the dunes in the string has to be
    established.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains one line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le K \le 66$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N
    \le 10^{18}$</span>), the maximum possible height of a dune and
    the number of dunes in the string of dunes.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the number of different strings of dunes. Output the
    result modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9 +
    7$</span>.</p>
