<p>Croatia’s national television programme is broadcasting an
    entertainment show titled “I Love Croatia”, modeled on the
    licensed format <em>I love my country</em>. In this show two
    teams of celebrities and public figures play various games
    which require knowledge about Croatia. One of the games is
    <em>Happy Birthday</em>, which will be used in this task,
    although somewhat altered.</p>

<p>Eight players numbered one through eight are seated in a
    circle (see picture). One of them is holding a box which will
    explode after 3 minutes and 30 seconds <em>from the beginning
    of the game</em> when some colorful confetti will be blown out.
    The game begins with a question to the player holding the box.
    If the player <em>answers incorrectly or skips the
    question</em>, he is immediately given the next question. If
    the player <em>answers correctly</em>, he passes the box to the
    first player seated on his left and then that player gets the
    next question.</p>
<p>You are given the numbered label of the player who has the
    box in the beginning and the outcomes of the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> questions asked. Determine the
    numbered label of the player who had the box when it finally
    exploded. The question outcome is described with the following
    data - time passed <em>from the beginning of the question being
    asked to the moment an answer was given</em> and whether the
    answer was true (“T”), false (“N”) or skipped (“P”). The time
    between giving the answer and asking the next question
    shouldn’t be taken into consideration, as well as time
    necessary for the box to be passed to the next player. The box
    will surely explode on a player’s turn.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq K \leq 8$</span>), the numbered label
    of the player who has the box initially. The second line of
    input contains a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 100$</span>), the number of questions asked during
    the game. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 100$</span>), time passed from
    the beginning of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th question being asked to the
    moment an answer was given, measured in seconds, and a single
    character <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z$</span> (“T”, “N” or
    “P”), the type of answer given.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the numbered
    label of the player who had the box when it finally
    exploded.</p>
