<p>Given is a set of integers and then a sequence of queries. A
    query gives you a number and asks to find a sum of two distinct
    numbers from the set which is closest to the query number.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains multiple cases. Each case starts with an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 &lt; n \le
    1000$</span>. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contain distinct integer
    numbers. The next line contains a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> giving the number of queries,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; m &lt; 25$</span>. The
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines contain an
    integer of the query, one per line. All the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n+m$</span> integers are between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^7$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^7$</span>, inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output should be organized as in the sample below. For each
    query output one line giving the query value and the closest
    sum in the format as in the sample.</p>
