</div>Always Catch your Mon, Inc., (also know as ACM), wants to
    create a new product, called Pokémon Go Go. Users can purchase
    this application to help them play Pokémon go. The software
    accesses the poké stop locations near the current location as
    well as a list of Pokémon that can be found at each stop. The
    application then computes the shortest route one can follow to
    catch all the unique Pokémon, and return to the starting point.
    <p>The program assumes that the user is in a city where travel
    is restricted to moving only in the north–south and east–west
    directions. The program also assumes that all poké stops are on
    the intersection of two roads.</p>
<p>For example, consider a case where the application finds
    five nearby poké stops. Each stop’s location is indicated by
    two integers, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>,<span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is the number of blocks north of
    your starting position and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is the number of blocks west of
    your starting position. Consider if the locations of the five
    poké stops are <span class="tex2jax_process">$(5,9)$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(20, 20)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,1)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,8)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2,8)$</span> while the names of the Pokémon
    found at these stops are Evevee, Flareon, Flareon, Jolteon, and
    Umbreon, respectively. It is clear that one does not have to
    visit both the second and third stops, since the same Pokémon
    can be caught at either of them. The best route is to visit the
    first, fifth, fourth, and third stops (in that order) for a
    total distance of <span class="tex2jax_process">$28$</span>
    blocks, since:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The distance from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(5, 9)$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distance from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(5,
        9)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2,8)$</span>
        is <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distance from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2,8)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 8)$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distance from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,8)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,1)$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The distance from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,1)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input holds a single test case. The test case begins
    with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; n \le 20$</span>, which
    indicates the number of poké stops to consider. Each of the
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines specifies
    the location of a poké stop and the name of a Pokémon that can
    be found there. The location is specified by two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> separated by a single space,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-100 \le r,c \le 100$</span>.
    The integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> indicate that the stop
    is <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> blocks north and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> blocks east of the
    starting point. The location is followed by a single space and
    followed by the string <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>
    indicating the name of the Pokémon that can be caught there.
    Names have between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> letters (using only
    a–z and A–Z). The number of unique Pokémon is always less than
    or equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span>. Multiple
    pokémon can reside at the same location (but are then listed as
    separate poké stops).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Give the shortest distance, in blocks, required to catch all
    the unique Pokémon.</p>
