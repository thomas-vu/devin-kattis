<div class="problembody">
<p>Peter is expecting a large shipment of fuel oil, but he has
    a small problem (doesn’t everyone in these programming
    problems!). The only containers he has are a set of large
    bottles (each with the same volume) and a set of smaller
    bottles (also each with the same, but smaller volume). Given
    the volume of the shipment of oil, he would like to store the
    oil in the bottles so that</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>all of the oil is stored,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>each bottle is filled to the top, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the minimum number of bottles is used.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>While Peter thinks he has solved this problem for his given
    bottle sizes, he often spends hours wondering what would happen
    if his bottles had different volumes (apparently Peter doesn’t
    lead the most exciting life).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing three
    positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$v_1$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_2$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$s \leq 10^6$</span> is the volume of the
    shipment, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_1, v_2 \leq
    10^6$</span> are the volumes of the two types of bottles, with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_1 &gt; v_2$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of bottles of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_1$</span> and the number of bottles of
    size <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_2$</span> which satisfy
    Peter’s two conditions. If the conditions cannot be met, output
    <tt class="tt">Impossible</tt>.</p>
