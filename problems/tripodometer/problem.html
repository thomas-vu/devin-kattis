<div class="problembody">
<p>A trip odometer can be used to record the distance driven on
    a single trip. You are very diligent: at the start of each trip
    you reset the trip odometer to read <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and at the end of each trip you
    write down the distance travelled.</p>
<p>Thus, you maintain a list of distances (in kilometers) taken
    by all trips. Unfortunately, exactly one number from this list
    is spurious; you mistakenly recorded the length of one trip you
    took in another vehicle. You also forget which entry in your
    list corresponds to this trip.</p>
<p>You want to know all possible total distances that you could
    have taken in your own vehicle given that one of the written
    distances was fake. More specifically, all values <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> such that it is possible to remove
    one trip from your list and have the remaining distances sum to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 10^5$</span>), the number of
    distances you wrote down. The second line of input consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_1, d_2, \ldots , d_ N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d_ i \leq 10^4$</span>),
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span> is the length
    of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th trip you
    recorded.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display two lines. The first line should contain a single
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, which is the
    number of possible distinct distances that could be obtained.
    The second line should contain the list of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> distinct integers, each of which
    is a possible sum that can be obtained by removing exactly one
    of the written distances. The list should be displayed in
    ascending order.</p>
