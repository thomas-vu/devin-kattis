<p>Recently your town has been infested by swindlers who
    convince unknowing tourists to play a simple dice game with
    them for money. The game works as follows: given is an
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-sided die, whose sides
    have <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \ldots , n$</span>
    pips, and a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>. You then roll the die, and then
    have to make a choice. Option <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is to stop rolling. Option
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> is to reroll the die,
    with the limitation that the die can only be rolled
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> times in total. Your
    score is the number of pips showing on your final roll.</p>
<p>Obviously the swindlers are better at this game than the
    tourists are. You, proud supporter of the Battle Against
    Probabilistic Catastrophes, decide to fight this problem not by
    banning the swindlers but by arming the tourists with
    information.</p>
<p>You create pamphlets on which tourists can find the maximum
    expected score for many values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>. You are sure that the swindlers
    will soon stop their swindling if the tourists are better
    prepared than they are!</p>
<p>The layout of the flyers is done, and you have distribution
    channels set up. All that is left to do is to calculate the
    numbers to put on the pamphlet.</p>
<p>Given the number of sides of the die and the number of times
    you are allowed to roll, calculate the expected (that is,
    average) score when the game is played optimally.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>A single line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 100$</span>, the number of
        sides of the die, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq
        k\leq 100$</span>, the number of times the die may be
        rolled.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the expected score when playing optimally. Your
    answer should have an absolute or relative error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-7}$</span>.</p>
