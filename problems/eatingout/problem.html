<div class="problembody">
<p>Alice, Bob, and Clara are eating at a new restaurant today.
    They’re having trouble deciding what to order, so Alice
    proposes that they each pick some items from the menu, and then
    they will order the items that everyone picked. The menu has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> items, and Alice, Bob,
    and Clara will order <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> items respectively. Is it possible
    for them to pick some items such that no item is picked by
    everyone?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single line with four integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq m\leq 100,000$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq a, b, c\leq m$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it’s possible for Alice, Bob, and Clara to pick some item
    such that no item on the menu is picked by everyone, print
    “possible” (without quotes). Otherwise, print “impossible”.</p>
