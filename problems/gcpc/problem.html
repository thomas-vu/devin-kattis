</div>One hundred years from now, in <span class="tex2jax_process">$2117$</span>, the International Collegiate
    Programming Contest (of which the NCPC is a part) has expanded
    significantly and it is now the Galactic Collegiate Programming
    Contest (GCPC).

    <p>This year there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    teams in the contest. The teams are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1,2,\ldots ,n$</span>, and your favorite
    team has number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<p>Like today, the score of a team is a pair of integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a,b)$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is the number of solved problems
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> is the total
    penalty of that team. When a team solves a problem there is
    some associated penalty (not necessarily calculated in the same
    way as in the NCPC – the precise details are not important in
    this problem). The total penalty of a team is the sum of the
    penalties for the solved problems of the team.</p>
<p>Consider two teams <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_2$</span> whose scores are <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a_1,b_1)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a_2,b_2)$</span>. The score of team
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1$</span> is better than that
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_2$</span> if either
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1&gt;a_2$</span>, or if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1=a_2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_1&lt;b_2$</span>. The rank of a team is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k+1$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is the number of teams whose score
    is better.</p>
<p>You would like to follow the performance of your favorite
    team. Unfortunately, the organizers of GCPC do not provide a
    scoreboard. Instead, they send a message immediately whenever a
    team solves a problem.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 10^5$</span> is the number of
    teams, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le
    10^5$</span> is the number of events.</p>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
    that describe the events. Each line contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le t \le n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le p
    \le 1000$</span>), meaning that team <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> has solved a problem with penalty
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>. The events are
    ordered by the time when they happen.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines. On
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th line, output
    the rank of your favorite team after the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> events have happened.</p>
