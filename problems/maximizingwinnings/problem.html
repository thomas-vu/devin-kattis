<p>You are a contestant on a game show where the goal is to win
    as much money as you can. The game is played in a building with
    many numbered rooms, and starting from room 1 with no money,
    you take a fixed number of turns. For each turn you either stay
    in the same room, or walk to an adjacent room. Then you do this
    again, and again, etc. Each turn earns you some amount of money
    (or perhaps none). All rooms are connected, but going through a
    door in one direction may earn a different amount of money than
    going through in the other direction.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> games. Each gameâ€™s description
    starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n
    \le 50$</span>, indicating that rooms <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \ldots , n$</span> are in use. This is
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines that
    describe an <span class="tex2jax_process">$n\times n$</span>
    matrix of numbers in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0,2\, 000]$</span>. The matrix entry for
    row <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and column
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> indicates the amount
    of money received by going directly from room <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to room <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> (or for staying in the same room
    if <span class="tex2jax_process">$i = j$</span>) on any turn.
    Following the description of the rooms is an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le m \le 5\, 000$</span>,
    indicating the number of turns that you take. Input ends when
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each game, print the maximum and minimum dollar amounts
    you can win. Each amount is less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{31}-1$</span>.</p>
