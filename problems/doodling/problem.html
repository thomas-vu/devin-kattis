<p>When thinking about a hard problem a lot of people like to
    doodle, to create “an unfocused drawing that can help the
    memory and improve abstract thinking”. The most basic form of
    doodle is a repetitive pattern covering the whole page. One way
    to create such a pattern is to take a graphing paper and start
    in the top-left corner <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span> and fill out the square, then
    move down and right one square <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,1)$</span>, fill it out, and so on. Every
    time you hit the edge of the paper you reverse direction, until
    you are back at the starting point. This will create a very
    soothing pattern.</p>
<p>However, to ensure you don’t spend the whole competition
    doodling you need to figure out how how many squares you will
    have to fill in the paper to complete the doodle before you
    even start doodling.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>First line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 4000$</span>, the number of
    test cases.</p>
<p>Each test case consists of a line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq x\; y \leq 20000$</span>,
    the height and width (in squares) of the graphing paper.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The number of unique squares you will have filled in before
    you are done with your doodle.</p>
