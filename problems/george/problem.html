<div class="problembody">
<p>Last week Mister George visited Croatia. Since Mister George
    is a very important person, while he was in a street, the
    police <b class="bfseries">disallowed entry</b> to that street,
    but vehicles that entered the street before Mister George could
    continue driving.</p>
<p>While Mister George was visiting, Luka drove his truck
    around town. But because of some of the streets being closed
    off, he couldn’t make his delivery in time and almost lost his
    job. Although it is late now, he is wondering how he could have
    planned his delivery better, i.e., what would have been the
    least time needed to make his delivery while Mister George was
    visiting. He knows the route mister George took.</p>
<p>The city is modeled with intersections and two-way streets
    connecting them. For each street, Luka knows how much time he
    needs to traverse it (mister George needs the same amount of
    time).</p>
<p>For example, if Mister George starts traversing a street
    during minute 10 and needs 5 minutes to exit it, this street
    will be blocked during minutes 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14. Luka can
    enter the street during minutes 9 and earlier, or 15 and later.
    If Luka arrives during minutes 10-14, he has can wait at the
    intersection until minute 15 and then enter the street.</p>
<p>Write a program that calculates the least amount of time
    Luka needs to make his delivery, if he starts driving
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> minutes after the
    arrival of Mister George.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 1\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le
    M \le 10\, 000$</span>), the number of intersections and the
    number of streets. The intersections are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<p>The second line contains four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le A, B \le N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le K
    \le 2000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le G \le
    1000$</span>). These are, in order:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The intersection where Luka starts;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The intersection Luka must get to;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The difference in starting times between mister George
        and Luka (Luka starts at intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> minutes after mister George
        starts his route);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of intersections on Mister George’s
        route.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The third line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> integers, the labels of
    intersections mister George will visit. Every pair of adjacent
    integers denotes a street he will traverse. That street will
    exist and Mister George will traverse every street at most
    once.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines contains three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>, meaning that there is a street
    between intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, and it takes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> minutes to traverse.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> will be between 1 and
    1000.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the least amount of time (in minutes) Luka needs to
    make his delivery.</p>
