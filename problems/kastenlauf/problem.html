<p>Once every year, Jo and his friends want to visit the local
    fair in Erlangen, called Bergkirchweih. This year, they want to
    make a Kastenlauf (box run). They start at Jo’s home, and have
    one box (Kasten) of beer (with twenty bottles). As they are
    very thirsty, they drink one bottle of beer every 50
    metres.</p>
<p>As the way from Jo’s home to the Bergkirchweih is pretty
    long, they need more beer than they have initially.
    Fortunately, there are stores selling beer on the way. When
    they visit a store, they can drop their empty bottles and buy
    new bottles, but their total number of full bottles will not be
    more than twenty (because they are too lazy to carry more than
    one full box).</p>
<p>You are given the coordinates of the stores, of Jo’s home
    and of the location of the Bergkirchweih. Write a program to
    determine whether Jo and his friends can happily reach the
    Bergkirchweih, or whether they will run out of beer on the
    way.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with one line containing the number of test
    cases <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$t \leq 50$</span>).</p>
<p>Each test case starts with one line, containing the number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> of stores selling beer
    (with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq n \leq
    100$</span>).</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n+2$</span> lines
    cointain (in this order) the location of Jo’s home, of the
    stores, and of the Bergkirchweih. The location is given with
    two integer coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, (both in meters, <span class="tex2jax_process">$-32768 \leq x, y \leq 32767$</span>).</p>
<p>As Erlangen is a rectangularly laid out city, the distance
    between two locations is the difference of the first coordinate
    plus the difference of the second coordinate (also called
    Manhattan-Metric).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case print one line, containing either “happy”
    (if Jo and his friends can happily reach the Bergkirchweih), or
    “sad” (if they will run out of beer on the way).</p>
