        A Volbonan cooking stew.
      </div>
</div>
<p>The Volbonans of the Luncheon Kingdom are cooking their
    famous Stupendous Stew! For the Volbonans, Stupendous Stew is
    simply any soup that has saltiness level <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and sweetness level <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>.</p>
<p>However, Bowser has stolen all of their ingredients! All
    they have left are existing soups: <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> soups of varying salt levels
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1,a_2,\dots ,a_ n$</span> and
    sweetness levels <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_1,b_2,\dots
    ,b_ n$</span>. The Volbonans are attempting to salvage the
    situation by mixing their soups into a Stupendous Stew.</p>
<p>The saltiness and the sweetness of a mixture of soups is
    given by the weighted sum of the soups used to make it. For
    example if a mixture consisted of <span class="tex2jax_process">$75\% $</span> of a soup of <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> saltiness and <span class="tex2jax_process">$25\% $</span> of a soup of <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> saltiness, it would have a
    saltiness of <span class="tex2jax_process">$3.5$</span>.</p>
<p>More formally, for each soup <span class="tex2jax_process">$i = 1, \ldots , n$</span>, let <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq p_ i \leq 1$</span>) denote the
    proportion of soup <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    used in a mixture. Then, the saltiness of the mixture is given
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sum _{i=1}^ n p_ ia_
    i$</span> and the sweetness is <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sum _{i=1}^ n p_ ib_ i$</span>. The sum of
    all <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> must be
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<p>Tell the Volbonans if they can make Stupendous Stew. If they
    can, tell them how to make it.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input is an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100\, 000$</span>,
    representing the number of existing soups. The following line
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1,a_2,\ldots ,a_ n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq a_ i\leq 1\,
    000$</span>), the saltiness levels of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> soups. The following line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_1,b_2,\ldots ,b_ n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq b_ i\leq 1\, 000$</span>), the
    sweetness levels of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> soups. The last line contains
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq x,y \leq 1\, 000$</span>), the target
    saltiness and sweetness levels.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is possible to make the Stupendous Stew, on the first
    line print “Yes” followed by a second line with proportions of
    each soup used in the mixture <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1, p_2, \dots , p_ n$</span>. Otherwise,
    print “No”.</p>
<p>If it is possible to make the Stupendous Stew, your answer
    will be accepted if both the sweetness of your mixture and the
    saltiness do not exceed an absolute or relative error of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
