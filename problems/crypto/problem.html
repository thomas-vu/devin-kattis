<p>Lukáš invented a special cryptographic algorithm. He can not
    tell you the details, of course. However, there is one problem.
    He doesn’t know how to select strong keys for messages. Can you
    help him?</p>
<p>Suppose that a message is a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. The strongest key is an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> written in base <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> has the most zeros at the end. In
    case of a tie, the smallest such <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> is the strongest.</p>
<p>For example, the strongest key for <span class="tex2jax_process">$N = 72$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$K = 2$</span>, because <span class="tex2jax_process">$72 = 1001000_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$72$</span> written in base <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>) has <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> zeros at the end. Using base
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, we only get
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> zeroes at the end
    (because <span class="tex2jax_process">$72 = 2200_3$</span>),
    using base <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> would also
    give us <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> zeros, and no
    other base would give us more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> zero.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains one line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 10^{12}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output contains one line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> written in base <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> has the most zeros at the end and
    is the smallest <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> with
    this property.</p>
