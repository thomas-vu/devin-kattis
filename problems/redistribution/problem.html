<p>Linda is giving an exam. When the exam is over, Linda will
    redistribute the exams among the students for a peer review, so
    they may grade each other’s answers and assign preliminary
    scores.</p>
<p>The students are split up in several rooms of varying sizes.
    Linda has devised the following scheme for redistributing the
    exams:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Linda visits the first room, picks up all exams written
        there, and places them in a pile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In each subsequent room Linda takes exams from the top
        of her pile and randomly distributes them to the students
        in the room. She then picks up all exams written in that
        room and adds them to the bottom of her pile.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After having visited each room exactly once, Linda
        returns to the first room, and distributes the remaining
        exams from her pile there.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Naturally, it is imperative that no student receives their
    own exam to review, and that Linda does not run out of exams in
    her pile while doing the redistribution (i.e., that when
    entering a room after the first one, Linda’s pile contains at
    least as many exams as there are students in the room). Whether
    or not this is the case depends on the order in which the rooms
    are visited. We say that an ordering of the rooms is
    <em>safe</em> if Linda will not run out of exams in her pile
    when visiting rooms in that order, and that there is no chance
    that any student receives their own exam to review.</p>
<p>Can you find a safe order in which to visit the rooms (or
    determine that no safe order exists)?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le n \le 30$</span>), the number of
        rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1, \ldots , s_ n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le s_ i \le 100$</span> for each
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>), where
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> is the number
        of students in room <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is impossible to redistribute the exams safely, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”. Otherwise, output a
    safe order in which to visit the rooms. If there are multiple
    safe orders, you may give any of them.</p>
