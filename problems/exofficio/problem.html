<p><i class="itshape">“I have come to the conclusion that one
    useless man is called a disgrace, that two are called a law
    firm, and that three or more become a Congress!” ­–Peter
    Stone.</i></p>
<p>The bureaucracy of government is often criticized; the
    frequency of fruitless meetings, the inefficiency of
    discussions and the like are common topics of ridicule.</p>
<p>The government is trying to change that impression. To
    start, they have hired you to redesign the structure of the
    capitol to decrease inefficiency.</p>
<p>The capitol can be represented as a grid with <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rows and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> columns. Each of the cells in this
    grid is a chamber where meetings can be held. Right now, there
    are no walls between any of the chambers; thus, in one minute,
    it is possible to travel directly from one chamber to any of
    the chambers it shares a side with in the grid. That is, if we
    denote the chamber at the <span class="tex2jax_process">$r^\text {th}$</span> row and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c^\text {th}$</span> column of this grid as
    chamber <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r, c)$</span>, then in
    one minute one can travel from chamber <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r, c)$</span> to any of the chambers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r-1, c)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r, c+1)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r+1, c)$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r, c-1)$</span> (if they exist).</p>
<p>Meetings are periodically held in different chambers, and
    unfortunately, many congressmen end up getting lost and fail to
    find their way to the required chamber, eating up precious
    time. Hence, the first requirement is</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>to build walls between chambers in such a way that there
        is <i class="itshape">exactly one</i> way to travel between
        any two chambers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At the same time, it is imperative that no matter which
    chamber the meeting is held in, all the congressmen in the
    capitol (who could be in any of the other chambers) can be
    gathered in a short amount of time. Hence, define the <i class="itshape">gathering time</i> of a chamber <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r, c)$</span> to be the maximum number of
    minutes required to travel from any chamber to chamber
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r, c)$</span>, assuming one
    takes the unique direct route. The second requirement is</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>to minimize the maximum gathering time across all
        chambers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>That is, across all wall-building plans satisfying the first
    requirement, you should choose one that minimizes the maximum
    gathering time.</p>

<p>Help the government get its act together and eliminate the

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains two integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq R, C, R \cdot C \leq 200\, 000$</span>), the number of
    rows and the number of columns of the grid, respectively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$R+1$</span> rows,
    representing a wall-building plan satisfying the requirements
    in the following format:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first row should contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \cdot C$</span> characters. The
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$c^\text {th}$</span>
        character in this row should be</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>a space, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>

<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rows
        should each contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \cdot
