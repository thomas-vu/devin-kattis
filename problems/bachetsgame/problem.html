</div>Bachetâ€™s game is probably known to all but probably not
    by this name. Initially there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> stones on the table. There are two
    players Stan and Ollie, who move alternately. Stan always
    starts. The legal moves consist in removing at least one but
    not more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> stones
    from the table. The winner is the one to take the last stone.
    Here we consider a variation of this game. The number of stones
    that can be removed in a single move must be a member of a
    certain set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    numbers. Among the <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    numbers there is always <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and thus the game never stalls.
    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a number of lines (between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, inclusive). Each line describes
    one game by a sequence of positive numbers. The first number is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \leq 1\, 000\, 000$</span> the
    number of stones on the table; the second number is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m \leq 10$</span> giving the
    number of numbers that follow; the last <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> numbers on the line specify how
    many stones can be removed from the table in a single move.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line of input, output one line saying either Stan
    wins or Ollie wins assuming that both of them play
    perfectly.</p>
