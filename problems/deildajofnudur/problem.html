<p>The dean of the university is organizing the finances of the
    university. The ministry of education provides financial
    support, according to a well defined government policy. The
    ministry finances the university by offering some number of
    grants. At the university there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span> departments, each labelled by an
    English letter. Each grant is dedicated to a specific
    department, which is decided by the ministry. All grants are
    equal in amount.</p>
<p>The dean can accept or reject each grant, but there are
    strict rules regarding this process. In order to limit the
    financial chaos for the ministry, the dean must select one
    contiguous sequence of grants to accept. The order of the
    grants is fixed and the dean is forbidden from shuffling them
    around. That means there can be no rejected grants between the
    earliest accepted grant and the latest accepted grant.
    Otherwise it would be too difficult for the ministry to plan
    its budget.</p>
<p>The dean wants to maximize the financial support the
    university receives. Ideally, he would like to accept all the
    grants. Sadly, his life is not so simple, since there is a
    requirement that all deparments which receive any funding must
    receive equal funding. This means that some departments may be
    completely unfunded. Some departments may even go completely
    unmentioned in the grants from the ministry.</p>
<p>Can you determine the highest number of grants the dean can
    accept and still fulfill these requirements?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of grants, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 200$</span>. The
    second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lowercase English letters, one for
    each grants, where each letter represents the department to
    which the grant is dedicated.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one integer, the highest number of grants the dean
    can accept and still guarantee all funded departments receive
    equal funding.</p>
<h2>Explanation of samples</h2>
<p>In the first sample, the dean can accept all the grants,
    since each department that is listed in the input is listed
    exactly once.</p>
<p>In the second sample, the dean can accept the grants
    <tt class="ttfamily">narnar</tt>, where each listed department
    appears twice. Note that department <tt class="ttfamily">h</tt>, for example, even though it is listed in the
    input, receives no funding in this case, which is
    acceptable.</p>
<p>In the third sample, the dean can accept the grants
    <tt class="ttfamily">arnanrnarnraranrna</tt>, where each listed
    department appears <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>
    times.</p>
