<p>Since ACTA has entered into force, Slavko has been spending
    his time offline, solving crosswords. Having solved almost all
    that he could get his hands on, he wants to make a few
    crosswords of his own. However, he is too sloppy for such fine
    work, so he has asked you to help him generate the
    crosswords.</p>
<p>You are given two words, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. The word <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> must be output horizontally, and
    the word <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> vertically,
    so that the two words cross (i.e., share exactly one letter).
    The shared letter must be the first letter in <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> that is also contained in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, more specifically the
    first occurrence of that letter in each word.</p>
<p>For example, given the words <span class="tex2jax_process">$A = \texttt{ABBA}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B = \texttt{CCBB}$</span>, you need to
    output <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> lines as shown
    below:</p>
<pre>
.C..
.C..
ABBA
.B..
</pre>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains two words,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, not more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> characters long, separated by a
    single space. Both words will contain only uppercase English
    letters. There will be at least one letter contained in both
    words.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> be the length
    of word <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> the length of word
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. The output must
    contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines, each
    containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> characters.
    The character grid must contain the two words crossed as
    described above. All other characters in the grid must be
    periods (the character “<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>”, without
    quotes), thus padding all lines to the length of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> characters.</p>
