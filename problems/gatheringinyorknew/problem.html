<div class="problembody">
<p>Hunters from all over the world are gathering in
    Yorknew — where the ‘International Hunter Programming
    Contest <span class="tex2jax_process">$2020$</span>’ will take
    place. As Gon has previously passed the final round of Hunter
    Exam and became a Hunter, you may be able to see Gon in
    Yorknew!</p>
<p>There is exactly one road leading to Yorknew — an
    infinitely long and narrow road. For simplicity, you can
    imagine the road as a straight line.</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> Hunters are going
    to Yorknew city. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th Hunter is currently at location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>. Yorknew city is at
    location <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. The Hunters
    all walk very fast — they move with velocity of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> unit per second.</p>
<p>To avoid traffic jam, Yorknew city administrators have
    decided to build two portals. It takes exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> second to teleport from one portal
    to the other. Hunters may choose to use or not use a portal as
    they wish.</p>
<p>The administrators want to place the two portals at some
    integer positions on the road, such that the total time it
    takes for all <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> Hunter
    to reach Yorknew city is as small as possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains exactly one integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> — the number of
    Hunters <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le h \le
    10^5)$</span>.</p>
<p>The second line contains exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> integers: the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> is the current location of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th Hunter.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(-10^9 \le x_ i \le
    10^9)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print only one integer — the total time it takes for
    all Hunters to reach Yorknew city.</p>
<h2>Explanation of sample test</h2>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> Hunters,
    at locations <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>. An optimal plan is to place two
    portals at <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>.</p>
<p>The time it takes for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> Hunters to reach Yorknew city are:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Thus, the total time is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 + 0 + 1 = 2$</span>.</p>
