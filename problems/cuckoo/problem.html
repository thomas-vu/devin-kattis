<div class="description"></div>
</div>One of the most fundamental data structure problems is
    the dictionary problem: given a set <span class="tex2jax_process">${D}$</span> of words you want to be able to
    quickly determine if any given query string <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> is present in the dictionary
    <span class="tex2jax_process">${D}$</span> or not. Hashing is a
    well-known solution for the problem. The idea is to create a
    function <span class="tex2jax_process">$h:\Sigma ^*\rightarrow
    [0..n-1]$</span> from all strings to the integer range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0,1,..,n-1$</span>, i.e. you
    describe a fast deterministic program which takes a string as
    input and outputs an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. Next you allocate an empty hash
    table <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> of size
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and for each word
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> in <span class="tex2jax_process">${D}$</span>, you set <span class="tex2jax_process">$T[h(w)]=w$</span>. Thus, given a query
    string <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>, you only need
    to calculate <span class="tex2jax_process">$h(q)$</span> and
    see if <span class="tex2jax_process">$T[h(q)]$</span> equals
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>, to determine if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> is in the dictionary.
    Seems simple enough, but aren’t we forgetting something? Of
    course, what if two words in <span class="tex2jax_process">${D}$</span> map to the same location in the
    table? This phenomenon, called collision, happens fairly often
    (remember the Birthday paradox: in a class of 24 pupils there
    is more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span>% chance
    that two of them share birthday). On average you will only be
    able to put roughly <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sqrt
    {n}$</span>-sized dictionaries into the table without getting
    collisions, quite poor space usage!

    <p>A stronger variant is Cuckoo Hashing<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000440"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a>. The
    idea is to use two hash functions <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_2$</span>. Thus each string maps to two
    positions in the table. A query string <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> is now handled as follows: you
    compute both <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_1(q)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_2(q)$</span>, and if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T[h_1(q)]=q$</span>, <em>or</em>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$T[h_2(q)]=q$</span>, you
    conclude that <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> is in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">${D}$</span>. The name “Cuckoo
    Hashing” stems from the process of creating the table.
    Initially you have an empty table. You iterate over the words
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> in <span class="tex2jax_process">${D}$</span>, and insert them one by one. If
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T[h_1(d)]$</span> is free, you
    set <span class="tex2jax_process">$T[h_1(d)]=d$</span>.
    Otherwise if <span class="tex2jax_process">$T[h_2(d)]$</span>
    is free, you set <span class="tex2jax_process">$T[h_2(d)]=d$</span>. If both are occupied
    however, just like the cuckoo with other birds’ eggs, you evict
    the word <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T[h_1(d)]$</span> and set
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T[h_1(d)]=d$</span>. Next you
    put <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> back into the
    table in its alternative place (and if that entry was already
    occupied you evict that word and move it to its alternative
    place, and so on). Of course, we may end up in an infinite loop
    here, in which case we need to rebuild the table with other
    choices of hash functions. The good news is that this will not
    happen with great probability even if <span class="tex2jax_process">${D}$</span> contains up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n/2$</span> words!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line of input is a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq t \leq 50$</span>
    specifying the number of test cases to follow. Each test case
    begins with two positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq n \leq 10000$</span> on a line
    of itself, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> telling the
    number of words in the dictionary and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> the size of the hash table in the
    test case. Next follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines of which the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>:th
    describes the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>:th word
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span> in the dictionary
    <span class="tex2jax_process">${D}$</span> by two non-negative
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_1(d_ i)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_2(d_ i)$</span> less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> giving the two hash
    function values of the word <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_
    i$</span>. The two values may be identical.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case there should be exactly one line of
    output either containing the string “<tt class="ttfamily">successful hashing</tt>” if it is possible to insert
    all words in the given order into the table, or the string
    “<tt class="ttfamily">rehash necessary</tt>” if it is
    impossible.</p>
