<p>Åke has heard that there may be some suspicious 5G radiation
    in his city. To test this, he uses the antenna on his roof to
    measure the 5G level each day. However, he does not know how he
    should analyze the data.</p>
<p>We are given the measurements for <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> consecutive days as a list of
    numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, \ldots , x_
    n$</span> (where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>
    denotes the measurement for day <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>) and a constant <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> that measures how much Åke expects
    the radiation to vary from day to day. We want to find, for
    each day <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, the most
    significant difference between the measurement on day
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and any earlier day,
    after the expected variations are taken into account. More
    precisely, the goal is to find the maximum value
    of</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ |x_ i-x_ j| - c \cdot
    |i-j| \]</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$j \le i$</span>. I.e.,
    we want to find a large difference in 5G level that has
    happened recently.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 4 \cdot 10^5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le c \le 10^6$</span>), the number of
    measurements and expected day-to-day variation. The second
    input line contains the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1,x_2,\dots ,x_ n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le x_ i \le 10^6$</span> for <span class="tex2jax_process">$i=1,2,\dots ,n$</span>), giving the
    measurements of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    days.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1, \ldots , y_ n$</span>,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span> is the most
    significant difference on day <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
