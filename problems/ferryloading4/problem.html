<p>Before bridges were common, ferries were used to transport
    cars across rivers. River ferries, unlike their larger cousins,
    run on a guide line and are powered by the river’s current.
    Cars drive onto the ferry from one end, the ferry crosses the
    river, and the cars exit from the other end of the ferry.</p>
<p>There is an <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>-meter-long ferry that crosses the
    river. A car may arrive at either river bank to be transported
    by the ferry to the opposite bank. The ferry travels
    continuously back and forth between the banks so long as it is
    carrying a car or there is at least one car waiting at either
    bank. Whenever the ferry arrives at one of the banks, it
    unloads its cargo and loads up cars that are waiting to cross
    as long as they fit on its deck. The cars are loaded in the
    order of their arrival; ferry’s deck accommodates only one lane
    of cars. The ferry is initially on the left bank where it broke
    and it took quite some time to fix it. In the meantime, lines
    of cars formed on both banks that await to cross the river.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le c \le 20$</span>, the number of test
    cases. Each test case begins with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le l \le 500$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le 10\, 000$</span>. Then follow
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines describing the
    cars that arrive in this order to be transported. Each line
    gives the length of a car (an integer number of centimeters
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>, inclusive),
    and the bank at which the car arrives (“left” or “right”).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line giving the number of
    times the ferry has to cross the river in order to serve all
    waiting cars.</p>
