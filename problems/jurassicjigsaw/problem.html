<p>The famous Jurassic park biologist Dean Oâ€™Saur has
    discovered new samples of what he expects to be the DNA of a
    dinosaur. With the help of his assistant Petra Dactil, he
    managed to sequence the samples, and now they are ready for
    analysis. Dean thinks this dinosaur was affected with a
    particular disease that mutated the DNA of some cells.</p>
<p>To verify his theory, he needs to compute the most likely
    <em>evolutionary tree</em> from the samples, where the nodes
    are the samples of DNA. Because there is no temporal data for
    the DNA samples, he is not concerned where the root of the tree
    is.</p>
<p>Dean considers the most likely evolutionary tree, the tree
    with smallest <em>unlikeliness</em>: the unlikeliness of a tree
    is defined as the sum of the weights of all edges, where the
    weight of an edge is the number of positions at which the two
    DNA strings are different.</p>
<p>As a world expert in data trees, he asks you to reconstruct
    the most likely evolutionary tree.</p>
<p>In the first sample, the optimal tree is <tt class="ttfamily">AA - AT - TT - TC</tt> . The unlikeliness of the
    edge between <tt class="ttfamily">AA</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">AT</tt> edge is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, because the strings <tt class="ttfamily">AA</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">AT</tt> differ in
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> position. The
    weights of the other two edges are also <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, so that the unlikeliness of the
    entire tree is <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. Since
    there is no tree of unlikeliness less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, the minimal unlikeliness of an
    evolutionary tree for this case is <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line consists of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 1\, 000$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq k\leq 10$</span>, the
        number of samples and the length of each sample
        respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contains a string of
        length <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> consisting
        of the characters in <tt class="ttfamily">ACTG</tt>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>On the first line, print the minimal unlikeliness of the
        evolutionary tree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, print <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>
        lines, each consisting of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq u,v &lt; n$</span>, indicating
        that in the most likely evolutionary tree, there is an edge
        between DNA string <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>. If there are
        multiple answers possible, any of them will be
        accepted.</p>
