<p>Khadija is working on her new game, which will be a…well,
    she doesn’t really know yet! She has made an extremely flexible
    game engine, and being a skilled developer, she can implement
    just about anything in it.</p>
<p>To find out what the game should contain, she has asked her
    friends for input. They have a lot of suggestions. So many, in
    fact, that to not overwhelm her with ideas, they have promised
    to only present at most one suggestion each.</p>
<p>However, they all want to give Khadija as many different
    suggestions as possible, so they have gathered and found a set
    of suggestions such that:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>They maximise the total number of suggestions they tell
        to Khadija</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every person suggests at most one of their own
        suggestions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When Khadija has received all the suggestions, she assigns
    them to one or more categories.</p>
<p>To get some variation into the game, she limits the number
    of suggestions from one category. She then picks as many
    suggestions as possible, given the category limits (A
    suggestion only counts towards one category).</p>
<p>While she’s busy implementing all these suggestions, her
    friends wonder how many suggestions she could’ve ended up
    implementing in theory.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with a single line with three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>: The number of friends, distinct
    suggestions and distinct categories, respectively.</p>
<p>Next follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> lines,
    one line for each friend: The line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$Fn_ i$</span> space separated suggestion
    names.</p>
<p>Then, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> lines follow,
    one for each category. The line starts with an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Cn_ i$</span>, the maximum
    number of suggestions Khadija wants to include that are
    assigned to this category, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$Sn_ i$</span> space separated suggestion
    names which are part of this category.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum number of suggestions Khadija could
    possibly end up implementing.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; F, S, C, Fn_ i\leq
        200$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; Cn_ i \leq Sn_ i
        \leq 100$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All suggestion names are unique, and consist of between
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> characters in the range
        <tt class="ttfamily">a–z</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">0–9</tt>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
