</div>Ouch! A kitten got stuck on a tree. Fortunately, the
    treeâ€™s branches are numbered. Given a description of a tree and
    the position of the kitten, can you write a program to help the
    kitten down?

    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a description of a single tree. The first line
    contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>,
    denoting the branch on which the kitten got stuck. The next
    lines each contain two or more integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a, b_1, b_2, \ldots $</span>. Each such line
    denotes a branching: the kitten can reach <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> from <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_1, b_2, \ldots $</span> on its way down.
    Thus, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> will be closer
    to the root than any of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_
    i$</span>. The description ends with a line containing
    <tt class="ttfamily">-1</tt>. Each branch <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> will appear on exactly one
    line. All branch numbers are in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$1..100$</span>, though not necessarily
    contiguous. You are guaranteed that there is a path from every
    listed branch to the root. The kitten will sit on a branch that
    has a number that is different than the root.</p>
<p>The illustration above corresponds to the sample input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the path to the ground, starting with the branch on
    which the kitten sits.</p>
