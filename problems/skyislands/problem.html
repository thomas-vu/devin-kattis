        a single skyisland
      </div>
</div>
<p>Alex wants to build a sky base consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> sky islands, numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, \ldots , N$</span>. There are a total of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> bridges, directly
    connecting certain islands to others. Because she does not have
    an elytra (wings that enable players to fly) and cannot fly,
    she needs to make sure that there exists a way for her to
    travel from one island to any other island. It is fine if she
    needs to travel through other islands to get to the
    destination. We call her islands connected if it exhibits such
    property. Note: a single island is always connected.<br/></p>
<p>Given the number of islands <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and all the bridges <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_1, \cdots , b_ M$</span>, would you be
    able to determine whether Alex’s islands are connected?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of two space-separated
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq
    900$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq M \leq
    10^6$</span>, representing the number of islands and the number
    of bridges respectively. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines each consist of two
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq
    a, b \leq N$</span>, representing a bridge between island
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and island
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “<tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt>” if all of Alex’s
    islands are connected. Output “<tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt>”
    otherwise.</p>
