<p>The magician shuffles a small pack of cards, holds it face
    down and performs the following procedure:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>The top card is moved to the bottom of the pack. The new
        top card is dealt face up onto the table. It is the Ace of
        Spades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two cards are moved one at a time from the top to the
        bottom. The next card is dealt face up onto the table. It
        is the Two of Spades.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Three cards are moved one at a time . . .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This goes on until the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>th and last card turns out to
        be the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> of
        Spades.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This impressive trick works if the magician knows how to
    arrange the cards beforehand (and knows how to give a false
    shuffle). Your program has to determine the initial order of
    the cards for a given number of cards.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line of the input is a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \le 13$</span> the number of
    test cases to follow. Each case consists of one line containing
    the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 13$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line with the correct
    permutation of the values <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, space separated. The first number
    showing the top card of the pack, etcâ€¦</p>
