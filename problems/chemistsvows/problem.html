<p>Chemist Clara swore a solemn vow—from now on, she can only
    speak atomic element symbols. Of course, this limits her
    ability to talk. She can say, for example, “I Am CLaRa” (as I
    is the symbol of iodine, Am is americium, C is carbon and so
    on). She can also say “InTeRnAtIONAl”, but she has a lot of
    trouble with “collegiate”, “programming” and “contest”.</p>
<p>Given a word, determine whether Clara can speak it (i.e. if
    it is a concatenation of atomic symbols). Without your help,
    she might as well have taken silence vows!</p>
<p>You may identify upper- and lowercase letters, as Clara
    cannot speak uppercase anyway. In case you forgot the elements’
    symbols, here is the complete periodic table:</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains the number of test
    cases <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le T \le 10\, 000$</span>).
    The descriptions of the test cases follow:</p>
<p>Each test case is a single lowercase word over the English
    alphabet. The length of the word is positive and does not
    exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$50\, 000$</span>. The
    total number of the length of all the words across all test
    cases is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{20}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the answers to the test cases in the order in which
    they appear in the input. For each test case print a single
    line containing the word <tt>YES</tt> if Clara can say the
    given word, and <tt>NO</tt> otherwise.</p>
