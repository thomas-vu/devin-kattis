<div class="problembody">
<p>Mirko has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> items
    (labeled with numbers from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> drawers (labeled with numbers from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>). All items are currently
    scattered throughout his room, so he decided to clean them up.
    Each drawer can contain one item, and in order to make it
    easier for Mirko to find them later, he has determined in
    advance exactly two drawers (<span class="tex2jax_process">$A_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span>) for
    each item <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
<p>Mirko stores the items in order from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> using the first rule he can
    apply:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>If the drawer <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_
        i$</span> is empty, he stores the item <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> in that drawer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the drawer <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_
        i$</span> is empty, he stores the item <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> in that drawer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try to move the item from <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> to its other drawer; if
        that one’s filled too, try moving that item to its other
        drawer, and so on until you either succeed or get back to a
        previously seen drawer. In case of success, store the item
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> in the drawer
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span>. In case of
        failure, continue to next rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Try moving the item from <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span> to its other drawer; if
        that one’s filled too, try moving that item to its other
        drawer, and so on until you either succeed or get back to a
        previously seen drawer. In case of success, store the item
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> in the drawer
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span>. In case of
        failure, continue to next rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give up and throw away the item <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For given pairs of drawers for each item, determine which
    items will be stored and which will be thrown away.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of two integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N, L \leq 300\, 000$</span>), the number of items and the
    number of drawers.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains two integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq A_ i, B_ i \leq L$</span>), the pair
    of drawers corresponding to item <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. The numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span> will be different.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each item, respectively, output where it ends up. In
    case the item is stored successfully, output “<tt class="ttfamily">LADICA</tt>” (without quotes, Croatian word for
    drawer). In case the item is thrown away, output “<tt class="ttfamily">SMECE</tt>” (without quotes, Croatian word for
    trash).</p>
