<p>Atrebla is developing a new smartphone camera app that she
    believe will be the next big hit on the app store. Camera apps
    usually display the image mirrored left-to-right on the screen,
    so that what you see on the screen matches the movement of your
    face. To help her camera app stand out from the rest, Atrebla
    will be adding a unique effect that mirrors an image both
    left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Help her implement this
    feature.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 100$</span> giving the number of test
    cases. Each test case starts with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq R \leq 20$</span>), the number of
    rows in the image, and an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq C \leq 20$</span>), the number of columns. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> lines contain
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> characters, all of
    which are either <tt class="ttfamily">.</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">*</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing “<tt class="ttfamily">Test <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span></tt>”
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is the test case
    number starting from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.
    After that, output the mirrored image.</p>
