<div class="problembody">
<p>For this problem, you are given two things: a numeric
    interval <span class="tex2jax_process">$[A,B]$</span>, and a
    list of other numeric intervals which, when combined, should
    “cover” (overlap completely with) the interval <span class="tex2jax_process">$[A,B]$</span>. In particular, you should
    find a <em>minimal</em> set of the intervals needed for the
    cover.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> test cases. Each test case begins
    with two real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A \le
    B$</span>, indicating that <span class="tex2jax_process">$[A,
    B]$</span> is the interval to be covered. Then follows an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 20\,
    000$</span>, giving the number of intervals available. After
    this follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th of which contains
    two real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i} \le
    b_{i}$</span>, indicating that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th interval is <span class="tex2jax_process">$[a_{i}, b_{i}]$</span>. All real numbers
    have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> digits
    after the decimal point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing the minimal
    number of intervals needed to cover <span class="tex2jax_process">$[A, B]$</span>, followed by a line
    containing the indices of one such optimal covering (the first
    interval has index <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>,
    the second index <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and
    so on). The intervals can be given in any order.</p>
<p>If it is not possible to cover <span class="tex2jax_process">$[A, B]$</span> using the intervals, output a
    line containing the word “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”
    instead.</p>
