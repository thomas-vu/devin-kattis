<p>Often times it is sufficient to know the rough size of a
    number, rather than its exact value. For example, a human can
    reason about which store to visit to buy milk if one store is
    roughly <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> kilometer
    away, and another store is roughly <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> kilometers away. The exact
    distance to each store is irrelevant to the decision at hand;
    only the sizes of the numbers matter.</p>
<p>For this problem, determine the ‘size’ of the factorial of
    an integer. By size, we mean the number of digits required to
    represent the answer in base-<span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\,
    000$</span> integers, one per line. Each is in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0,1\, 000\, 000]$</span>. Input
    ends at end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>,
    print the number of digits required to represent <span class="tex2jax_process">$n!$</span> in base-<span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>.</p>
