<div class="problembody">
<p>A very popular position has just opened up at Poodle Inc.
    Candidates have formed a queue while they wait for their turn
    to be interviewed.</p>
<p>Competition is fierce and each candidate knows that they
    will not be selected if another candidate is strictly better
    than them. Every minute, each candidate looks at the resumé of
    candidates who are currently adjacent to them in the queue
    (ahead and behind). If at least one of the neighbour’s resumé’s
    perceived value is strictly greater than their resumé’s
    perceived value, they leave the queue since they do not want to
    waste their time. The candidates all look at their neighbor’s
    resumé simultaneously, and then some candidates leave the queue
    simultaneously.</p>
<p>This process continues until no more candidates leave the
    queue. Determine the number of minutes that pass while this
    process takes place. Report the values of the candidates that
    leave the queue in each round. Also report the final state of
    the queue.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 100\, 000$</span>), which is
    the number of candidates.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_1, \ldots , v_ N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq v_ i \leq 10^9$</span> for each
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq N$</span>), where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> is the perceived
    value of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm
    {th}$</span> candidate.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, the number
    of minutes taken by this process. Then display <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> line should contain
    the perceived values of the candidates who left the queue in
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span>
    minute in the same relative order that they appeared in the
    queue. Finally display a line indicating the final list of
    perceived values in the queue after candidates no longer leave
    it.</p>
