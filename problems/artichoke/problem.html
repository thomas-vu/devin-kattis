</div>Fatima Cynara is an analyst at Amalgamated Artichokes
    (AA). As with any company, AA has had some very good times as
    well as some bad ones. Fatima does trending analysis of the
    stock prices for AA, and she wants to determine the largest
    decline in stock prices over various time spans. For example,
    if over a span of time the stock prices were <span class="tex2jax_process">$19$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>, then the largest decline would
    be <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> between the first
    and fourth price. If the last price had been <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> instead of <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>, then the largest decline would
    have been <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> between the
    last two prices.

    <p>Fatima has done some previous analyses and has found that
    the stock price over any period of time can be modelled
    reasonably accurately with the following
    equation:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \operatorname
    {price}(k) = p \cdot (\sin (a \cdot k+b) + \cos (c \cdot k+d) +
    2) \]</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> are constants. Fatima would like
    you to write a program to determine the largest price decline
    over a given sequence of prices. Figure 1 illustrates the
    price function for Sample Input 1. You have to consider
    the prices only for integer values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le p \le 1\, 000$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le a, b, c, d \le 1\, 000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 10^6$</span>). The first <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> integers are described above. The
    sequence of stock prices to consider is <span class="tex2jax_process">$\operatorname {price(1)}, \operatorname
    {price(2)}, \ldots , \operatorname {price}(n)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the maximum decline in the stock prices. If there is
    no decline, display the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. Your output should have an
    absolute or relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
