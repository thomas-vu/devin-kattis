<p>Your crazy aunt has asked you to watch her cats while she’s
    attending a seminar about making cat hats out of cat fur. Your
    aunt owns a great number of cats – all toms – and, due to the
    complex social structure of cats, every cat has a specific but
    different amount of hate reserved for every other cat.</p>
<p>Over the years, the cats have been spoiled to the point that
    they demand (at the least) <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> milliliter of milk at tea time.
    Your task is to feed the cats the aforementioned milk, in order
    to dull their primal instincts and prevent an all-out cat
    war.</p>
<p>The task is complicated by three things:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Your aunt has a limited amount of milk stored in the
        fridge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For each pair of cats, there is a distance they have to
        be kept from each other to avoid infighting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The excessive amount of meowing has driven you to drink
        large amounts of hard liquor, and now you can’t move
        liquids without constant spilling. You will spill
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> milliliter of the
        milk you carry for every meter you walk.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Given an amount of milk, and a set of cats – each pair of
    cats being a given distance apart from each other – determine
    if it’s possible to feed every cat at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> milliliter of milk. Every cat has
    a cat bowl that can hold an arbitrary amount of milk. For every
    meter you walk, you will definitely spill <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> milliliter of milk (instantly
    spoiling it), but instead of carrying all the milk at once, you
    may serve a cat more milk than needed and pick it up when
    backtracking (the cat will not drink the excess milk before
    you’re finished walking). The cats will never move, but they
    will eye each other with intense hate.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the number of test
    cases.<br/>
    Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    cases begins with a line containing two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, separated by a space, denoting
    the amount of milk in the fridge in milliliters and the number
    of cats, respectively.<br/>
    This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{C
    \cdot (C-1)}{2}$</span> (combinations of cats) lines containing
    three positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_{i,j}$</span>, separated by single spaces,
    describing the distance between the cat with index <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and the cat with index
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> in meters. Cats are
    numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> up to
    and including <span class="tex2jax_process">$C-1$</span>, and
    each pair of cats will be listed exactly once. You may assume
    that the fridge is placed at the very same location as cat
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq
        20$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq 20\,
        000$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C \leq 2\,
        000$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq D_{i,j} \leq 3\,
        000$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cats co-exist in dimensions far greater than our three,
        so you can assume that every pair of cats is correctly
        separated by <em>exactly</em> the given distance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt> if it’s possible to
    serve every cat at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> milliliter of milk. Output
    <tt class="ttfamily">no</tt> if it’s not.</p>
