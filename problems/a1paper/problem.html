<p>Björn likes the square root of two, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sqrt {2} = 1.41421356\dots $</span> very
    much. He likes it so much that he has decided to write down the
    first <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span> digits of
    it on a single paper. He started doing this on an A4 paper, but
    ran out of space after writing down only <span class="tex2jax_process">$1250$</span> digits. Being pretty good at
    math, he quickly figured out that he needs an A1 paper to fit
    all the digits. Björn doesn’t have an A1 paper, but he has
    smaller papers which he can tape together.</p>
<p>Taping two A2 papers together along their long side turns
    them into an A1 paper, two A3 papers give an A2 paper, and so
    on. Given the number of papers of different sizes that Björn
    has, can you figure out how much tape he needs to make an A1
    paper? Assume that the length of tape needed to join together
    two sheets of papers is equal to their long side. An A2 paper
    is <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{-5/4}$</span> meters
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{-3/4}$</span> meters
    and each consecutive paper size (A3, A4, ) have the same shape
    but half the area of the previous one.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq n \leq 30$</span>, the
    A-size of the smallest papers Björn has. The second line
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> integers
    giving the number of sheets he has of each paper size starting
    with A2 and ending with A<span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Björn doesn’t have more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> sheets of any paper
    size.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If Björn has enough paper to make an A1 paper, output a
    single floating point number, the smallest total length of tape
    needed in meters. Otherwise output “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”. The output number should have an
    absolute error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span>.</p>
