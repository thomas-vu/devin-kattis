<p>You are an experienced investor who is investing in multiple
    companies. At the end of the year you are expected to file your
    taxes, which requires you to track and report the total number
    of shares you held during any of your trading days during the
    year.</p>
<p>The records you have kept are sorted by company: for each
    company, you have a list of notes stating how many shares of
    that company you owned on a given day.</p>
<p>Your tax accountant has asked you to produce a list of the
    total number of shares across all companies you have held on
    each of the days on which you have traded and recorded your
    holdings.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le C \le 20$</span>), the total number of companies of which
    you hold shares. Next will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> blocks of records, one for each
    company.</p>
<p>Each record block starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le K \le 50$</span>), which is the number of records you have
    kept for this company. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> lines of input, each containing
    two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 1\, 000$</span>)
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le D \le 365$</span>), denoting that you
    held <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> shares of this
    company on day <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>. In
    each companyâ€™s record block, there will be at most one entry
    for each possible trading day, but the days in the record block
    may be specified in any order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print, on a single line, for each day for which you have at
    least one record, the total number of shares held on that day.
    The share totals shall be printed in increasing order of
    trading days.</p>
