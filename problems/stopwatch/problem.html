<div class="problembody">
<p>Robin just received a stopwatch from her grandfather.
    Robin’s stopwatch has a single button. Pressing the button
    alternates between stopping and starting the stopwatch’s timer.
    When the timer is on, the displayed time increases by 1 every
    second.</p>
<p>Initially the stopwatch is stopped and the timer reads 0
    seconds. Given a sequence of times that the stopwatch button is
    pressed, determine what the stopwatch’s timer displays.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 1\, 000$</span>), which is the
    number of times the stopwatch was pressed.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    describe the times the stopwatch’s button was pressed in
    increasing order. Each line contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq t \leq 10^6$</span>), which is the
    time the button was pressed. No two button presses happen on
    the same second.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display <tt class="ttfamily">still running</tt> if the
    stopwatch’s timer is still running after all button presses
    were made. Otherwise display the number of seconds displayed on
    the stopwatch’s timer.</p>
