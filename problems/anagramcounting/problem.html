<p>An anagram is a reordering of the letters in a word of
    phrase. For example, you can rearrange the letters of
    <tt class="ttfamily">terraced</tt> to get the word <tt class="ttfamily">retraced</tt>. Rearranging them some more will give
    you the word <tt class="ttfamily">cratered</tt>. You can even
    make <tt class="ttfamily">dactrere</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">redatrec</tt>, which are both anagrams of <tt class="ttfamily">terraced</tt> even if they are not legitimate
    English words.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> words, one per line. Each word
    consists of upper- and lower-case letters (aâ€“z) and may have as
    many as <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters.
    Input ends at end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For every input word, output the total number of unique
    anagrams that can be made from it. For the purpose of this
    problem, upper- and lower-case letters are considered
    distinct.</p>
