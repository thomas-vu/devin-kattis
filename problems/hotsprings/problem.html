</div>Iceland is famous for its geothermal activity, which
    supplies the country with much of its electricity and heating.
    It is also a source of pleasure, in the form of hot springs.
    <p>Kalle is visiting one of Iceland’s famous hot springs. It
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> pools of
    water, where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th one
    has temperature <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>.
    Although staying in one of the warmer pools for a long time
    sure is relaxing, Kalle is on a very tight schedule and just
    wants a quick dip in each of the pools. As you may know, the
    nicest thing about hot baths is the contrast between hot and
    cold. Therefore, to get the most out of his stay, Kalle wants
    to find an ordering of the pools so that the difference in
    temperature between subsequent pools is increasing.</p>
<p>Given a sequence of pool temperatures <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1, t_2, \dots , t_ n$</span>, rearrange
    them into a new sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$t’_1,
    t’_2, \dots , t’_ n$</span> such that for all <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq i \leq n-1$</span> it holds
    that</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ |t’_{i-1} - t’_ i|
    \leq |t’_ i - t’_{i+1}|. \]</span>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le n \leq 10^5$</span>), the number
        of pools.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1, \ldots , t_
        n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^5\leq t_ i
        \leq 10^5$</span> for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>), the temperatures in each of
        the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> pools.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a rearrangement of the sequence satisfying the given
    requirement. If no solution exists, output “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”. If there are multiple valid
    solutions, you may output any one of them.</p>
