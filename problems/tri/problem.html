<div class="problembody">
<p>Little Mirko wrote into his math notebook an equation
    containing three positive integers, the equals sign and one of
    the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction,
    multiplication and division).</p>
<p>During another class, his friend Slavko erased the equals
    sign and the operations from Mirkoâ€™s notebook. Help Mirko by
    reconstructing the equation from the three integers</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three integers less than
    100, separated by spaces. The input data will guarantee that a
    solution, although not necessarily unique, will always
    exist.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>On a single line, output a valid equation containing the
    three integers (in the same order), an equals sign and one of
    the four operations. If there are multiple solutions, output
    any of them.</p>
