<div class="problembody">
<p>As part of a CS course, Alice just finished programming her
    robot to explore a graph having <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> nodes, labeled <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \ldots , n$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> directed edges. Initially the
    robot starts at node <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<p>While nodes may have several outgoing edges, Alice
    programmed the robot so that any node may have a <em>forced
    move</em> to a specific one of its neighbors. For example, it
    may be that node <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>
    has outgoing edges to neighbors <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> but that Alice programs the robot
    so that if it leaves <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> it must go to
    neighbor <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>.</p>
<p>If operating correctly, the robot will always follow forced
    moves away from a node, and if reaching a node that does not
    have a forced move, the robot stops. Unfortunately, the robot
    is a bit buggy, and it might violate those rules and move to a
    randomly chosen neighbor of a node (whether or not there had
    been a designated forced move from that node). However, such a
    bug will occur <em>at most once</em> (and might never
    happen).</p>
<p>Alice is having trouble debugging the robot, and would like
    your help to determine what are the possible nodes where the
    robot could stop and not move again.</p>
<p>We consider two sample graphs, as given in Figures 1
    and 2. In these figures, a red arrow indicate an edge
    corresponding to a forced move, while black arrows indicate
    edges to other neighbors. The circle around a node is red if it
    is a possible stopping node.</p>

<p>In the first example, the robot will cycle forever through
    nodes <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> if it does not make a buggy move.
    A bug could cause it to jump from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, but that would be the only buggy
    move, and so it would never move on from there. It might also
    jump from <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> and then have a forced
    move to end at <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>.</p>
<p>In the second example, there are no forced moves, so the
    robot would stay at <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    without any buggy moves. It might also make a buggy move from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to either <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, after which it would stop.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, designating the number of nodes
    and number of edges such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 10^3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le m
    \le 10^4$</span>. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines will each have two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le |a|, b \le n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$|a|
    \neq b$</span>. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$a &gt;
    0$</span>, there is a directed edge between nodes <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> that is not forced. If
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> &lt; 0, then there is
    a forced directed edge from <span class="tex2jax_process">$-a$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. There will be at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$900$</span> such forced moves.
    No two directed edges will be the same. No two starting nodes
    for forced moves will be the same.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the <em>number</em> of nodes at which the robot
    might come to a rest.</p>
