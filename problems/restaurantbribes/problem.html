<p>Several participants in programming competitions end up
    founding startup companies. Two of them created Eeet, a social
    restaurant rating system. Each member of Eeet can rate a
    restaurant with an integer score from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> or not give a score at all. The
    score that a person sees is the average of ratings from the
    friends who gave one. In particular, a person giving a score of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> will in general
    decrease the rating that their friends see, whereas not giving
    a score at all will not affect it. If none of the friends of a
    user has given a rating to a restaurant, then the restaurant
    does not show up to that user.</p>
<p>Two other past contestants have opened a restaurant, The
    Smelly Fish, but they are bewildered as to why nobody is dining
    at their establishment. Through experimentation they found out
    that each person is willing to come once to the restaurant (for
    some inexplicable reason no customer ever returns) and spend
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100y$</span> SEK, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> is the rating they see
    on Eeet. Everybody pays by card, and money transactions are not
    rounded.</p>
<p>However, they did not get any ratings yet, and all the fresh
    produce they bought risks going past its prime. Hence they
    selected some people to bribe so that they will leave them a
    rating in Eeet. For each person, we know that they will give
    The Smelly Fish a rating according to the function <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lfloor \sqrt {x}/a\rfloor $</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is a constant
    depending on the person, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is the amount of the bribe in SEK.
    Note that a person bribed with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> SEK will leave a rating of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> (instead of not giving
    a rating at all), that the maximum rating is <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, and that a person that received
    a bribe knows about the scheme and will not go to the
    restaurant.</p>
<p>Your task is to maximize the profit the restaurant makes,
    i.e., the income from customers minus the money spent on
    bribes.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq m \leq 10^5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq
    n \leq 10^5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq k
    \leq n$</span>), the number of people in Eeet, the number of
    friendship relations, and the number of people we are going to
    bribe.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq a,b \leq n$</span>), the ids of a pair of friends. No
    unordered pair <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ a,b\} $</span>
    appears more than once.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    lines contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq i \leq n$</span>), the id of a person we are going to
    bribe, and the parameter <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
    i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a_ i \leq 1\,
    000$</span>). No id appears more than once.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with the maximum profit the restaurant can
    make. Answers with an absolute or relative precision up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> will be
    accepted.</p>
