<div class="problembody">
<p>As a preschool teacher you are used to kids not coming to
    school due to sickness. A part of your job is taking
    attendance, so you have a list of which students came to school
    on which day. Today is Wednesday and you are look at the
    attendance on Monday and Tuesday. You are interested in which
    students came to school on both Monday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>To adhere to local privacy laws no names appear on the list
    of attendance. The children are instead represented by numbers.
    So you want to know what numbers appear on both lists.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n, m \leq 100$</span>). The second line of the input
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> distinct
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x \leq 10^5$</span>). The third line
    of the input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    distinct integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x \leq 10^5$</span>).
    The second line describes the students that attended on Monday,
    and the third line describes thee students that attended on
    Tuesday.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should contain those numbers in the output that
    appear on both the second and the third line of the input, in
    the order they appear on the second line.</p>
