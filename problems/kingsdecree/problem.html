      SoCCat the Cat King is a very fair cat. Currently, SoCCat
      wants to ensure all cats can live in peace and harmony!
    </blockquote>
<p>The Cat Kingdom is a very large kingdom, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cats living in it. The cats are
    numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>King SoCCat has noticed a glaring problem in the kingdom —
    the uneven distribution of wealth among the cats. To solve this
    problem, King SoCCat has decreed that wealthy cats should give
    some of their wealth to poorer cats — to ensure that all cats
    can live in peace and harmony.</p>
<p>After surveying each cat in the kingdom, King SoCCat has
    determined that:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Cat <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> has
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_ i$</span> units of
        wealth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cat <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is not
        willing to have less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_
        i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$l_ i \leq w_
        i$</span>) units of wealth.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As a fair king, SoCCat wants to ensure that all cats have
    <em>at least</em> <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_ i$</span>
    units of wealth, and the poorest cat has the maximum possible
    wealth.</p>
<p>To achieve this, King SoCCat can do the following any number
    of times:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Choose a cat <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
        with wealth <em>strictly greater</em> than <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_ i$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose any other cat <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, and give <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> unit of wealth from cat
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to cat
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, King SoCCat is not very good at math.
    Therefore, as a friend of the Cat Kingdom, help King
    SoCCat!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, denoting the number
    of test cases (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C \leq
    300\, 000$</span>). Each test case has the following
    format.</p>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, denoting the number of cats in
    the kingdom (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 300\,
    000$</span>). The sum of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> over all test cases does not
    exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$300\, 000$</span>.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_1, w_2, \ldots , w_ n$</span>, denoting
    the wealth of each cat (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq
    w_ i \leq 10^9$</span>).</p>
<p>The third line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_1, l_2, \ldots , l_ n$</span>, denoting
    the minimum wealth that each cat is willing to have
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq l_ i \leq w_
    i$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing a single
    integer denoting the maximum possible wealth that the poorest
    cat can have, if King SoCCat distributes the wealth of the cats
    in the kingdom fairly and optimally.</p>
