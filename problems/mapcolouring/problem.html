<p>A map maker wants to colour different countries or provinces
    on his maps using different colours. That is, he wants to
    colour countries that share a common border with a different
    colour. He has heard that any map can be coloured with four
    colours, but even after a lot of puzzling he is unable to
    colour some of his maps using four colours. Interested in the
    problem, and hoping that he can publish four-coloured maps, the
    map maker visits you for help.</p>
<p>After inspecting his maps you explain to the map maker that
    not every map can be coloured with four colours. You tell him
    that when countries are made up of different non-connected
    parts (such as Alaska and the rest of the United States), it
    can be the case that one needs more colours. Also, if the maps
    contains a quadripoint (a point where four countries touch), it
    can also be the case that one needs more colours. The same is
    true when more than four countries meet in one point.</p>
<p>Disappointed, the map maker asks you whether you cannot help
    him in quickly deciding how many colours he needs. While you
    try to explain that this is a quite difficult question, he
    shows you his maps. After a lot of persuasion by him, and the
    realisation that all his maps are actually very small, you
    agree to make a computer program for him. You agree to write a
    program for his small maps (at most 16 countries) that
    determines whether his map can be coloured with 1, 2, 3, 4 or
    more colours. This program should still work if there are
    non-connected countries, quadripoints, etc.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 33$</span>), the number of
    test cases. Then for each test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, indicating the number of
        countries <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C \leq 16$</span>)
        and the number of borders <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq B \leq 120$</span>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> lines with two
        space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq i, j \leq C-1$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i \neq j$</span>),
        indicating that there is a border between country
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and country
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing either
    an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, or the
    string ’<tt class="ttfamily">many</tt>’. Your program should
    output the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> is the minimum
    number of colours needed to colour the map if this number is 1,
    2, 3 or 4. Your program should output ’<tt class="ttfamily">many</tt>’ if this number is larger.</p>
