<div class="problembody">
<p>There is an upcoming raid event in an online game. You are
    the leader of a guild with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> adventurers. In this game, every
    adventurer has a rating <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> for each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> skills that every adventurer must
    learn. A high <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> value
    indicates mastery at that skill. You wish to group the
    adventurers into raid teams using the following steps:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Amongst all currently available adventurers, the
        adventurer with the highest <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> value for the first skill is
        selected. In cases of ties, the adventurer with the
        lexicographically smallest name is selected. That
        adventurer is no longer available from now on.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The same selection criteria is applied for the second
        and third skill in order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>These three adventurers will form a raid team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The process repeats starting from the first skill until
        no more teams of three can be formed. There could be
        situations where some players are not part of any raid
        teams. They will stay behind and guard the guild hall
        during the event.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Report the members of every newly-created raid team, in the
    order which the teams were formed. All <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> adventurers are available
    initially.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \leq N \leq 100\, 000$</span>). <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines follow, each line beginning
    with the name of the adventurer followed by three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_1\: S_2\: S_3$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq S_1, S_2, S_3 \leq 2\,
    000\, 000\, 000$</span>) describing the level of proficiency of
    the adventurer in the three skills in order. All names are
    non-empty alphanumeric string of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> characters, and all names are
    unique.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Whenever a raid team is formed, on a new line, output the
    three names of the adventurers of the new team from the
    lexicographically smallest name to the lexicographically
    largest name, with a single space between consecutive
    names.</p>
<h2>Subtasks</h2>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span> Points)</b>: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10\, 000$</span>, all
        adventurers have the same skill values for all three
        skills.</p>
