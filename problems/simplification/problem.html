<p>Mapping applications often represent the boundaries of
    countries, cities, etc.Â as polylines, which are connected
    sequences of line segments. Since fine details have to be shown
    when the user zooms into the map, these polylines often contain
    a very large number of segments. When the user zooms out,
    however, these fine details are not important and it is
    wasteful to process and draw the polylines with so many
    segments. In this problem, we consider a particular polyline
    simplification algorithm designed to approximate the original
    polyline with a polyline with fewer segments.</p>
<p>A polyline with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    segments is described by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n+1$</span> points <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_0 = (x_0, y_0), \ldots , p_ n = (x_ n, y_
    n)$</span>, with the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th
    line segment being <span class="tex2jax_process">$\overline{p_{i-1}p_ i}$</span> . The
    polyline can be simplified by removing an interior point
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq n-1$</span>), so that the line
    segments <span class="tex2jax_process">$\overline{p_{i-1}p_
    i}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\overline{p_
    ip_{i+1}}$</span> are replaced by the line segment <span class="tex2jax_process">$\overline{p_{i-1}p_{i+1}}$</span>. To select
    the point to be removed, we examine the area of the triangle
    formed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_{i-1}$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_{i+1}$</span> (the area is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> if the three points are colinear),
    and choose the point <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_
    i$</span> such that the area of the triangle is smallest. Ties
    are broken by choosing the point with the lowest index. This
    can be applied again to the resulting polyline, until the
    desired number <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> of line
    segments is reached.</p>
<p>Consider the example below.</p>

<p>The original polyline is shown at the top. The area of the
    triangle formed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_2$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_3$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_4$</span> is considered (middle), and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_3$</span> is removed if the
    area is the smallest among all such triangles. The resulting
    polyline after <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_3$</span> is
    removed is shown at the bottom.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n \leq 200\, 000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq m &lt; n$</span>). The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n+1$</span> lines specify <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_0, \ldots , p_ n$</span>. Each point is
    given by its <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates which are
    integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$-5000$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5000$</span> inclusive. You
    may assume that the given points are strictly increasing in
    lexicographical order. That is, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i &lt; x_{i+1}$</span>, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i = x_{i+1}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i &lt; y_{i+1}$</span> for all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq i &lt; n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>th line
    the index of the point removed in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>th step of the algorithm described
    above (use the index in the original polyline).</p>
