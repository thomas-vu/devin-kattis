<div class="problembody">
<p>Farmer John has a problem: it’s raining, and his pastures
    are at risk of flooding. Luckily he’s invested in a
    state-of-the-art drain system that ensures that the water level
    is the same across the farm. He hasn’t been as lucky with the
    terrain. Farmer John’s cows can only stand on dry land: if the
    land becomes wet, any cow on that land drowns. Luckily, cows
    can move one grid sector each hour, giving them a chance to
    escape the water (the levels of which rise and fall each
    hour).</p>
<p>Farmer John has divided his field into grid sectors, which
    he indexes with a row and column. Each grid sector is small
    enough to only be able to hold one cow.</p>
<p>Given a description of Farmer John’s field, the starting
    locations of his cows, and the height of the water at each
    hour, and assuming that Farmer John’s cows are extremely
    intelligent and prescient, and so can always make the best
    move, what is the maximum number of Farmer John’s cows that
    could survive?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There will be a single test case in the input. This test
    case will begin with a line with three integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 100$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le k \le 100$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le h \le 24$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> represents the size of Farmer
    John’s field (it’s <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \times
    n$</span> grid sectors), <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is the number of cows in the
    field, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> is the
    number of hours he needs to track.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines will contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    integers each, which represent the height of each grid sector
    of Farmer John’s field (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le
    \text {height} \le 100$</span>). The first row in the input is
    row <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, and the last is
    row <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. The first
    column in each row is column <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, and the last is column
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines
    will each contain a pair of integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le r &lt; n, 0 \le c &lt; n$</span>). Each line indicates the
    grid sector position of one cow at hour 0, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is the row and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is the column. No two cows will be
    in the same position. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> lines will each contain a single
    integer, indicating the level of the flood at that hour
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le \text {level} \le
    100$</span>). These lines are given in order: hour <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> first, then hour <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and so on. Note that the times
    start at hour <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and the
    cows’ positions are given at hour <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, so the cows have an opportunity
    to move (or MOOOOve) before the first hour’s flood. A grid
    square is considered to be flooded if its <span class="tex2jax_process">$\text {height} \le \text {level}$</span> of
    the flood at a given hour.</p>

<p>Output a single integer denoting the maximum possible number
    of surviving cows.</p>
