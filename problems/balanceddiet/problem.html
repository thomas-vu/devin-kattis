<div class="problembody">
<p>Appreciating the time savings, product consistency and
    nutritional value of prepared foods, you have decided to eat
    all your meals from cans. You have a shopping bag full of cans,
    enough for the next two meals. You want to finish the entire
    contents of all of these cans within the next two meals, but,
    since you have no means of refrigeration, you can’t save
    partial cans from one meal to the next. You need to divide the
    cans up so you have approximately the same caloric intake for
    each of the next two meals. If you can’t make it work out
    exactly, you will choose to eat more calories for your first
    meal and fewer for your second.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$150$</span> test cases, one per line. Each
    test case starts with a positive integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 20$</span>, indicating the
    number of cans in your shopping bag. This is followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integer values in the
    range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[100,600]$</span>, each
    one representing the calorie value of a particular can. The
    sequence of test cases ends with a value of zero for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For every test case, print out a line giving your calorie
    intake for the next two meals under the optimal partitioning of
    cans.</p>
