<p>Great scientific discoveries are often named by the last
    names of scientists that made them. For example, the most
    popular asymmetric cryptography system, RSA was discovered by
    Rivest, Shamir and Adleman. Another notable example is the
    Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm, named by Knuth, Morris and
    Pratt.</p>
<p>Scientific papers reference earlier works a lot and it’s not
    uncommon for one document to use two different naming
    conventions: the short variation (e.g. KMP) using only the
    first letters of authors last names and the long variation
    (e.g. Knuth-Morris-Pratt) using complete last names separated
    by hyphens.</p>
<p>We find mixing two conventions in one paper to be
    aesthetically unpleasing and would like you to write a program
    that will transform long variations into short.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input will contain at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters,
    uppercase and lowercase letters of the English alphabet and
    hyphen (‘<tt class="ttfamily">-</tt>’ ASCII <span class="tex2jax_process">$45$</span>). The first character will always
    be an uppercase letter. Hyphens will always be followed by an
    uppercase letter. All other characters will be lowercase
    letters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output should contain the
    appropriate short variation.</p>
