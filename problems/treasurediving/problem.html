<div class="problembody">
<p>Legends often tell of great treasures. But you rarely get
    the chance to actually stumble upon those treasures. Most of
    them are lost in the sea, or hidden below mountains. But as you
    learned from one of your biggest idols, treasures do belong
    into a museum. And now you have the chance to make that
    happen.<br/></p>
<p>On an expedition you found a large cave network. A native
    shaman has spoken about incredible values his ancestors have
    hidden in the caves. He even gave you an ancient map, depicting
    the cave network and the location of the treasures within.
    Sadly, the cave network is completely flooded. Since the trip
    out here takes forever, you decided to do a short dive and
    scout out the cave network. But on your arrival back at the
    entrance to the cave network you get the news<span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span> a volcano just erupted
    nearby. It is next to guaranteed that the lava will cover the
    entries to the cave network and the treasures will be lost
    forever.<br/></p>
<p>That puts you on the spot. You only have a short time left,
    and only one lousy tank of air. So it is all on you. You only
    have time for a single dive. But how could you possible decide
    which route to take? The cave network is huge, and you should
    definitely try and rescue as much of the treasures as possible.
    You think back to your times as a computer scientist at the
    university<span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span> And
    then it hits you. You still have your laptop with you. You
    could write a program to help you figure out the best you can
    do in rescuing the treasures.</p>
<p>You may assume that neither locating or picking up a
    treasure within a cave nor the traversal of a cave consumes any
    air.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each test set consists of multiple test cases. The file
    starts with a single number <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; t \le 2000$</span>) on a single line, denoting the number
    of testcases in the file. Each test case starts with two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> on a single line,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> the number of
    caves and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> the number
    of the connecting tunnels in the network (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10\, 000$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq m \leq 50\, 000$</span>). This line
    is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines,
    giving a description of the tunnels of the cave as three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> denoting caves and <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> giving the amount of air necessary
    for diving through the tunnel (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le a, b &lt; n; 0 \le l \le 500$</span>). After the tunnels
    follows an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> on
    a single line, giving the number of idols in the cave system
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq i \leq 8$</span>). This
    line is followed by a single line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1, \ldots , p_ i$</span> giving the caves
    withing the network conaining an idol (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le p_1,\ldots ,p_ i &lt; n$</span>). The
    input is concluded by a single number, giving the liters of air
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> you have available
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le a \le 1\, 000\,
    000$</span>). You will always start (and end) at the node with
    the label <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case print a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> on a single line, where X is
    replaced by the maximal number of idols the diver can
    recover.</p>
