<p>Oh no! Donald Duck accidentally went through Professor
    Ludwig von Drake’s reversing machine, so now everything he sees
    is mirror inverted.</p>
<p>Quack-it, this was very untimely. Scrooge McDuck namely has
    a very important quest for Donald Duck. He needs Donald to
    choose the biggest out of two money bags so that he, Mr.
    McDuck, can become even richer than he already is.</p>

<p>In order to not make his uncle furious, Donald Duck has
    asked you for help. He will give you the two mirror inverted
    numbers he sees on the two money bags. Your task is to help him
    choose the biggest of these numbers. Print <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt> if Donald should choose the first number and
    <tt class="ttfamily">2</tt> if he should choose the second
    number. Keep in mind: The mirror reversal has made Donald see
    twos as fives and fives as twos. Otherwise Donald Duck will see
    the digits as they are, but in reversed order. The bags don’t
    contain the same amount of money and the numbers on the bags
    neither start nor end with a zero.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line with two space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N, M &lt; 10^6$</span>)</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt> if the first bag has more
    money, or <tt class="ttfamily">2</tt> if the second bag has
    more.</p>
