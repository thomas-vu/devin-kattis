<div class="problembody">
<p>Lars is planning to do a backpacking tour by train
    throughout <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> cities in
    Europe. He has a list of train lines numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> that each goes back and forth
    between some pair of cities, no two between the same pair. He
    wants to visit the cities in the order <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\dots $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, finally returning back to his
    home in city <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<p>Since Lars has limited vacation days, he only has time to
    take exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> direct
    trains during his trip. Can you determine if this is possible,
    and tell Lars the numbers of the train lines he should
    take?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 10^6$</span>), the number of cities Lars wants to
    visit, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le M \le 10^6$</span>), the
    number of train lines.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines
    contains a pair of integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le a \neq b \le N$</span> representing a train line between
    cities <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. The train lines are
    numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> in the order that they
    appear in the input. No two train lines go between the same
    pair of cities.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If Lars cannot make the trip, output <tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>. Otherwise, output a sequence of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines. These should be
    the numbers of the train lines Lars should take <b class="bfseries">in order of travel</b>.</p>
