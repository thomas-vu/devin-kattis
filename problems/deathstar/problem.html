<div class="problembody">
<p>Young jedi Ivan has infiltrated in The Death Star and his
    task is to destroy it. In order to destroy The Death Star, he
    needs an array of non-negative integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> that represents the code for
    initiating the self-destruction of The Death Star. Ivan doesn’t
    have the array, but he has a piece of paper with requirements
    for that array, given to him by his good old friend Darth
    Vader.</p>
<p>On the paper, a square matrix of the size <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is written down. In that matrix
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th row and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th column there is a number that
    is equal to bitwise and between numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ j$</span>. Unfortunately, a lightsaber
    has destroyed all the fields on the matrix’s main diagonal and
    Ivan cannot read what is on these fields. Help Ivan to
    reconstruct an array for the self-destruction of The Death Star
    that meets the requirements of the matrix.</p>
<p>The solution doesn’t need to be unique, but will always
    exist.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 1\, 000$</span>), size of the matrix. Each of the
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_{ij}$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq m_{ij} \leq 10^9$</span>), the
    elements of the matrix. Additionally, each diagonal element
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$m_{ii}$</span>) is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain any array of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> non-negative integers
    at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> that meet
    the requirements from the task.</p>
