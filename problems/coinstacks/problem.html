</div>A and B are playing a collaborative game that involves
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> stacks of coins,
    numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Every round of the
    game, they select a nonempty stack each, but they are not
    allowed to choose the same stack. They then remove a coin from
    both the two selected stacks and then the next round begins.
    <p>The players win the game if they manage to remove all the
    coins. Is it possible for them to win the game, and if it is,
    how should they play?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le n \le 50$</span>), the number of coin stacks. Then follows
    a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    nonnegative integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2,
    \ldots , a_ n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
    i$</span> is the number of coins in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th stack. The total number of
    coins is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the players can win the game, output a line containing
    “<tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt>”, followed by a description of
    the moves. Otherwise output a line containing “<tt class="ttfamily">no</tt>”. When describing the moves, output one move
    per line, each move being described by two distinct integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>) indicating that the players
    remove a coin from stacks <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. If there are several possible
    solutions, output any one of them.</p>
