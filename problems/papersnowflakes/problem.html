<p>To make a paper snowflake, you fold a sheet of paper in
    various places and then cut some parts out of the folded sheet.
    When you unfold the sheet, it can make a very nice pattern.
    That is, if the folds and cuts are chosen well.</p>
<p>Samantha has recently taken up this hobby but with a “modern
    art” twist. To get started, she explores folding a strip of
    paper that is <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>
    picometres long (Samantha likes to measure her folds and cuts
    very precisely). She places it on the real line with one end at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and the other at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>. The left end at point
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> is affixed to this
    point, the other endpoint at position <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> is the <em>loose</em>
    endpoint.</p>
<p>She then performs a series of folds. For the first fold,
    Samantha creases the paper <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_1$</span> picometres from the loose end
    and folds the loose end over this fold. The loose end is now
    pointing towards the left. For the second fold, she then
    creases the top portion of the paper <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_2$</span> picometres from the loose end
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$f_2 &lt; f_1$</span>) and folds
    the top portion of the paper over this point back to the right
    over this crease point. The loose end is now pointing towards
    the right.</p>
<p>She alternates folding back-and-forth this way. At each
    step, she creases the top portion of the paper <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_ i$</span> picometres from the loose end
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$f_ i &lt; f_{i-1}$</span>) and
    folds the loose end over the crease.</p>
<p>She will now cut the paper at <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> distinct locations, which will
    split the paper into <span class="tex2jax_process">$M+1$</span>
    piles. Each of the piles will have zero or more layers of paper
    in it. The figure below depicts the folded paper from the first
    sample input, the cuts (solid lines), and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-locations of where the paper was
    folded (dashed lines).</p>
<p>What is the total length of paper in each of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M+1$</span> piles?</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10^5$</span>), which is the
    number of folds, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq 10^5$</span>),
    which is the number of cuts, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq L \leq 10^{18}$</span>), which is the length of the paper
    in picometres.</p>
<p>The second line describes the folds. This line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_1, f_2, \ldots , f_ N$</span>, indicating
    that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span>
    fold occurred <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_ i$</span>
    picometres from the loose end. These values satisfy
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq f_ N &lt; f_{N-1} &lt;
    \cdots &lt; f_1 &lt; L$</span>.</p>
<p>The third line describes the cuts. This line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1, c_2, \ldots , c_ M$</span>, indicating
    that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span>
    cut is <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span> picometres
    from the affixed point. These values satisfy <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^{18} \leq c_1 &lt; c_2 &lt; \cdots &lt;
    c_ M \leq 10^{18}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the total length of paper in each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$M+1$</span> piles, in order from left to
    right.</p>
