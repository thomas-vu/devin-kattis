</div>Sheila is a student and she drives a typical student car:
    it is old, slow, rusty, and falling apart. Recently, the needle
    on the speedometer fell off. She glued it back on, but she
    might have placed it at the wrong angle. Thus, when the
    speedometer reads <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, her
    true speed is <span class="tex2jax_process">$s+c$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is an unknown constant
    (possibly negative).

    <p>Sheila made a careful record of a recent journey and wants
    to use this to compute <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>. The journey consisted of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> segments. In the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> segment
    she traveled a distance of <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_
    i$</span> and the speedometer read <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> for the entire segment. This
    whole journey took time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>. Help Sheila by computing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>.</p>
<p>Note that while Sheila’s speedometer might have negative
    readings, her true speed was greater than zero for each segment
    of the journey.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>), the number of sections in Sheila’s
    journey, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le t \le 10^6$</span>), the
    total time. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each describing one segment
    of Sheila’s journey. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> of these lines
    contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_
    i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le d_ i \le 1\,
    000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$|s_ i| \le 1\, 000$</span>),
    the distance and speedometer reading for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> segment of the
    journey. Time is specified in hours, distance in miles, and
    speed in miles per hour.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the constant <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> in miles per hour. Your answer
    should have an absolute or relative error of less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
