<p>Robot Turtles is one of Theta’s favorite games. In this
    game, kindergarteners learn how to “code” by creating programs
    that move a turtle from a starting field to a diamond. Robot
    Turtles is reportedly the most successful game funded by the
    Kickstarter incubator.</p>
<p>In the actual board game, an adult plays the role of the
    “turtle master,” which is the person that plays the role of a
    CPU to execute the program. As you can imagine, this is a
    pretty boring task that cries out for automation: in this
    problem, you are asked to write a program that automates the
    task of the turtle master.</p>
<p>Robot Turtles is played on an <span class="tex2jax_process">$8 \times 8$</span> board. There is one
    turtle (marked with the letter <tt class="ttfamily">T</tt>),
    which always starts out at the bottom-left field, facing right.
    The board contains empty squares (marked as <tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>), castles made out of rock (<tt class="ttfamily">C</tt>), and castles made out of ice (<tt class="ttfamily">I</tt>). The diamond is marked with a <tt class="ttfamily">D</tt>. The turtle may move only onto empty squares
    and the square on which the diamond is located.</p>
<p>A turtle program contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> kinds of instructions, marked by a
    single letter.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">F</tt> The turtle moves one field
        forward in the direction it is facing. If the turtle faces
        a castle or the border of the board, a program error
        occurs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">R</tt> The turtle turns
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span> degrees to the
        right (the turtle will just turn and stay on the same
        field).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">L</tt> The turtle turns
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span> degrees to the
        left (the turtle will just turn and stay on the same
        field).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">X</tt> The turtle fires a laser in
        the direction it is facing. If the square it is facing
        contains an ice castle, the ice castle will melt and the
        square will turn into an empty square. Otherwise, a program
        error occurs. The turtle will not move or change direction.
        It is a program error to fire the laser at empty squares,
        rock castles or outside the board.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> lines. The first <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> lines contains the board, each
    line representing the squares in a row of the board. The turtle
    will always be at the bottom-left. There will be exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> diamond. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9^{\text {th}}$</span> line
    contains the program the turtle master is asked to execute,
    which contains at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span> instructions.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <tt class="ttfamily">Diamond!</tt> if the entire
    program can be executed without program error and if the turtle
    is on the diamond square after the program has been executed.
    Output <tt class="ttfamily">Bug!</tt> if a program error
    occurred, or if the turtle does not end up on the diamond
    square!</p>
