<p>Ashley and Brandon are playing the new hit card game,
    Ruffians!</p>
<p>In Ruffians, ten cards are dealt out in a grid of two rows
    and five columns. Each card has a number on it from 1 to 9.
    Ashley and Brandon are both looking for a pair of cards that
    have the same number.</p>
<p>After playing this game for a while, they realize that there
    is always a pair of cards that have the same number. To make
    the game harder, they require that they find a pair of cards
    with the same number, and that the two cards are in different
    rows and different columns.</p>
<p>Given an arrangement of cards, determine if such a pair
    exists or not.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq t \leq 10^3$</span>). This is the
    number of test cases.</p>
<p>Each test case is represented on two lines.</p>
<p>The first line of each test case contains five integers,
    each between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>. The second line of
    the test case also contains five integers, each between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>. These two lines combined form the
    grid of two rows and five columns of cards.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> lines, one
    for each test case.</p>
<p>For each test case, if there exists a pair of cards with the
    same number in different rows and different columns, output
    <tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt>. Otherwise, output <tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt>.</p>
