<div class="problembody">
<p>You are hosting a party with <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> guests and notice that there is an
    odd number of guests! When planning the party you deliberately
    invited only couples and gave each couple a unique number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> on their invitation.
    You would like to single out whoever came alone by asking all
    of the guests for their invitation numbers.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input gives the number of cases,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> test cases follow. For each test
    case there will be:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing the value <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> the number of guests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing a space-separated list of
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> integers. Each
        integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> indicates
        the invitation code of a guest.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N
    \leq 50, 0 &lt; C &lt; 2^{31}, 3 \leq G &lt; 1\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing “Case
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>: ” followed by the
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> of the guest
    who is alone.</p>
