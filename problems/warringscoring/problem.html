<p>Notnomde and Yraglac have been stuck at home for months, and
    have taken to playing ping pong to pass the time. Usually, the
    player who scores the highest number of points wins, but after
    a while Notnomde and Yraglac got tired of using the same rules
    all of the time. Both players decided on a new scoring system,
    but they came up with two different systems!</p>
<p>Under Notnomde’s system, the player with the longest
    consecutive streak of points wins, and the game is a tie if
    both player’s longest streaks are of the same length. Under
    Yraglac’s system, the player who held the largest lead over the
    other player at a single point during the game wins, and the
    game is a tie if both players’ highest leads were of the same
    number of points.</p>
<p>Sometimes the two systems agree on the outcome, but
    sometimes they don’t. In the first sample case, for example,
    Yraglac reached the largest lead of three points over Notnomde,
    but Notnomde had the longest streak with five consecutive
    points.</p>
<p>Given the sequence of points, will Notnomde and Yraglac
    agree or disagree about the outcome under their respective
    systems?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10^5$</span>, the
    total number of points scored in a game. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines then follow, each with the
    name of the player who scored that point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the outcome of the game (win for Notnomde, win for
    Yraglac, or tie) is the same under both systems, output
    <tt class="ttfamily">Agree</tt>. Otherwise, output <tt class="ttfamily">Disagree</tt>.</p>
