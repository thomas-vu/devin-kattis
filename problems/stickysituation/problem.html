<p>While on summer camp, you are playing a game of
    hide-and-seek in the forest. You need to designate a “safe
    zone”, where, if the players manage to sneak there without
    being detected, they beat the seeker. It is therefore of utmost
    importance that this zone is well-chosen.</p>
<p>You point towards a tree as a suggestion, but your fellow
    hide-and-seekers are not satisfied. After all, the tree has
    branches stretching far and wide, and it will be difficult to
    determine whether a player has reached the safe zone. They want
    a very specific demarcation for the safe zone. So, you tell
    them to go and find some sticks, of which you will use three to
    mark a non-degenerate triangle (i.e. with strictly
    positive area) next to the tree which will count as the safe
    zone. After a while they return with a variety of sticks, but
    you are unsure whether you can actually form a triangle with
    the available sticks.</p>
<p>Can you write a program that determines whether you can make
    a triangle with exactly three of the collected sticks?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq N \leq 20\, 000$</span>, the number
    of sticks collected. Then follows one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> positive integers, each less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{60}$</span>, the lengths of
    the sticks which your fellow campers have collected.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing a single word: <tt class="ttfamily">possible</tt> if you can make a non-degenerate
    triangle with three sticks of the provided lengths, and
    <tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt> if you can not.</p>
