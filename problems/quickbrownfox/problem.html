<p>A <i class="itshape">pangram</i> is a phrase that includes
    at least one occurrence of each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span> letters, ‘a’<span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span>‘z’. You’re probably familiar
    with this one: “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy
    dog.”</p>
<p>Your job is to recognize pangrams. For phrases that don’t
    contain every letter, report what letters are missing. We’ll
    say that a particular letter occurs in the phrase if it occurs
    as either upper case or lower case.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 50$</span>. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines are each a
    single phrase, possibly containing upper and lower case
    letters, spaces, decimal digits and punctuation characters
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’, ‘<tt class="ttfamily">,</tt>’,
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">?</tt>’, ‘<tt class="ttfamily">!</tt>’,
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">’</tt>’ and ‘<tt class="ttfamily">"</tt>’. Each phrase contains at least one and no
    more than 100 characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input phrase, output “pangram” if it qualifies as a
    pangram. Otherwise, output the word “missing” followed by a
    space and then the list of letters that didn’t occur in the
    phrase. The list of missing letters should be reported in lower
    case and should be sorted alphabetically.</p>
