<p>The Great Cardoni, Master Prestidigitator, has a deck of 21
    numbered cards which he uses in a trick as follows:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
      A spectator secretly selects a number between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$21$</span>, inclusive, after which Cardoni
      deals the <span class="tex2jax_process">$21$</span> cards,
      face-up, row by row in order from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$21$</span>, into a <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-column grid. The spectator then
      indicates which of the three columns contains the selected
      card, at which point the magician picks up the cards by
      columns, picking up the specified column second (the order of
      collecting the other two columns is unimportant). Cards are
      collected face up, beginning with the top card in each column
      and placing each succeeding card immediately beneath the
      previously collected card. The cards are then redealt by rows
      into a <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-column grid,
      starting from the top of the face-up deck. The process is
      repeated two more times; each time, the column indicated by
      the spectator is the second column picked up by the magician.
      After three such iterations, Cardoni announces, “I have
      penetrated to the heart of your mind; your card lies at the
      heart of this display.” And it’s true—the selected card is
      located at the “heart” of the array (row four, column two).
      Moreover, the selected card will always remain in this stable
      location for any further iterations of the column indication
      and card redealing process.
    </blockquote>
<p>The process always works, no matter the number selected,
    provided that the column containing the secret number is the
    second column to be picked up and redealt.</p>
<p>Cardoni would like to expand his trick to use different
    numbers of cards, rows, and columns, and to experiment with
    different orderings of picking up the columns after the
    spectator indicates a column. However, it is not a trivial
    problem. For instance, when using <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span> cards in <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> rows and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> columns, and always picking up the
    indicated column as the second one to redeal, the number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> eventually ends up in
    stable location row <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>,
    column <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, while the
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> ends up in
    stable location row <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>,
    column <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Also, neither
    location is one of the two “heart” positions in column
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> of rows <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>. Moreover, Cardoni is uncertain of
    how many iterations of the “indicate column and redeal” process
    are needed before a selected card reaches a stable
    location.</p>
<p>Given the number of rows and columns of cards, help Cardoni
    set up his trick in such a way that there is a unique stable
    location that is as close to the center as possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line with two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le r, c \le 10^6$</span>), the number of rows and columns used
    in the trick. The cards are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$r \cdot c$</span> and are initially dealt
    row by row in increasing order.</p>
<p><br/></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a line containing four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, where:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>the column indicated by the spectator should be picked
        up as the <span class="tex2jax_process">$p^{\text
        {th}}$</span> column,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using this value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> causes all cards to eventually
        end up in the stable location at row <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> column <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is the maximum
        number of iterations required for any card to reach the
        stable location.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> should
    be chosen so that the stable location <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i, j)$</span> is as close as possible to
    any of the one, two or four central positions in the grid,
    where the distance between locations <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i, j)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i’, j’)$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$|i-i’| + |j-j’|$</span>. If more than one
    value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> results in
    the same minimum distance, choose the smallest such
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>.</p>
