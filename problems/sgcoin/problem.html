<div class="problembody">
<p>There is a new cryptocurrency called SG coin. Alice
    purchases an item from Bob and pays in SG coin. The transaction
    is recorded in a blockchain. A blockchain is a chain of blocks
    where each block contains the hash value of the previous block,
    a transaction string, a token, and the hash value of the block
    (a positive integer with <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> trailing zeros).</p>
<p>Example: Suppose the hash value of the last block in the
    blockchain is <span class="tex2jax_process">$140\, 000\,
    000$</span> and the next transaction string to be recorded is
    “<tt class="ttfamily">alice-pays-bob-3-sg-coins</tt>”. The new
    block containing the transaction is appended (chained) to the
    last block in the blockchain like this:</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth ]{example.png}" src="/problems/sgcoin/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:90.00%"/>
</center>
<p>The token in the new block must be set to a number between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{9}-1$</span> such that the hashValue of
    the new block is positive and has <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> trailing zeros. If the token is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$606\, 969\, 470$</span> then the
    hashValue of the new block is computed as follow:</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">H(140000000,"alice-pays-bob-3-sg-coins",606969470)=990000000</tt></p>
<p>The function <tt class="ttfamily">H</tt> is given below (in
    C++ and Java format only). There can be many other valid values
    for the token that produces a valid hashValue (with 7 trailing
    zeros), e.g.,</p>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">H(140000000,"alice-pays-bob-3-sg-coins",306969470)=690000000</tt></p>
<p>In a distributed system, a new block can be added to the
    blockchain by anyone and then broadcast to everyone. Everyone
    will receive the new block and verify that it is valid (i.e.,
    the last block’s hashValue, transaction string, and token of
    the new block produces a hashValue with <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> trailing zeros). Everyone keeps
    track of the longest chain and only appends a new block to the
    longest chain that they have.</p>
<p>Charlie has a lot of computing power and he sees an
    opportunity to attack the distributed blockchain system by
    generating new blocks rapidly, thus producing the longest chain
    quickly. This allows him to monopolize new transactions to be
    appended to the blockchain.</p>
<p>Let’s see an attack scenario. Alice pays Bob <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> SG coins for purchasing an item,
    she puts the transaction in the blockchain and broadcasts. Bob
    sees the transaction in the blockchain and then gives the
    purchased item to Alice. Charlie then comes in to disrupt this
    transaction by creating two consecutive new blocks and
    broadcasting. Everyone sees the two new blocks from Charlie and
    keeps them, discarding the new block from Alice (which is
    shorter).</p>
<p>You are Charlie and you want to make life harder for Alice
    and Bob.</p>
<p>The hash function in C++:</p>
<pre>
long long H(long long previousHash, string &amp;transaction,
            long long token) {
  long long v = previousHash;
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; transaction.length(); i++) {
    v = (v * 31 + transaction[i]) % 1000000007;
  }
  return (v * 7 + token) % 1000000007;
}
</pre>
<p>The hash function in Java:</p>
<pre>
static long H(long previousHash, String transaction,
              long token) {
  long v = previousHash;
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; transaction.length(); i++) {
    v = (v * 31 + transaction.charAt(i)) % 1000000007;
  }
  return (v * 7 + token) % 1000000007;
}
</pre>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line is the hashValue of the last block in the
    blockchain. The hashValue is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 006$</span> inclusive and
    guaranteed to have <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>
    trailing zeros.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Produce two new blocks <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> as fast as possible. <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> should be chained to the last
    block (from the given input) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> should be chained to <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>. Print the transaction strings and
    the tokens of the two new blocks.</p>
<p>The first line contains the transaction string and the token
    for <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> separated by a
    space and the second line is for <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. The transaction string is
    non-empty and can be anything you want containing only
    lowercase English characters, digits (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0–9$</span>), or hyphen with at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters. The
    token must be an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9-1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Explanation</h2>
<p>The last three blocks have hashValues of: <span class="tex2jax_process">$140\, 000\, 000 \rightarrow 930\, 000\, 000
    \rightarrow 730\, 000\, 000$</span>.</p>
