<div class="problembody">
<p>Consider an ASCII art figure like the one on the left. If
    the figure contains only spaces and the <tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>
    and <tt>|</tt> symbols, then its possible to produce rotated
    versions of the figure using ASCII art. For example, the figure
    on the right is a 90 degree clockwise rotation of the one on
    the left (note that <tt>-</tt> and <tt>|</tt> are swapped in
    the rotation). Your job is to develop a program that rotates
    ASCII art figures like this automatically.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to 100 figures. Each figure starts with
    an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq
    100$</span>. Following this are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines of up to 100 characters
    each, containing only spaces, <tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>, and
    <tt>|</tt>. Each line ends in a non-space character. Each image
    has at least one non-space character somewhere in its leftmost
    column. Input ends with a line containing only the number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each figure, print a copy of the figure rotated 90
    degrees clockwise. Like the input, your output should contain
    no spaces after the last non-space character of a line, and
    adjacent figures should be separated by a single blank
    line.</p>
