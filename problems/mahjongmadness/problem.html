<p>Mahjong is an ancient game similar to poker, where players
    build hands of tiles to win. You are playing a very simple
    version of the game, where there is only one player and one
    “suit” of tiles. Tiles can be numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1-9$</span>, and there are a total of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> of each numbered tile,
    resulting in a total of <span class="tex2jax_process">$36$</span> tiles.</p>
<p>You win the game once you complete a hand, which consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span> tiles in total:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> “sets” of tiles and a
    “pair” of tiles. A “pair” of tiles is any pair of the same
    numbered tile, and a “set” of tiles can be either <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> of the same numbered tile, or a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-length straight of
    numbered tiles (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1-2-3$</span> or
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6-7-8$</span>). If a tile is
    counted in a “set” or “pair”, it cannot be counted again in any
    other “set” or “pair”. No set can wrap around (<span class="tex2jax_process">$8-9-1$</span> is not a valid set).</p>
<p>In addition, different completed hands have different
    scores. At the start of each game, you will be given a number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> such that all tiles
    numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> will be worth
    more points. In this game, a completed hand is worth
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> point, and each tile
    numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> in your
    completed hand is worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> additional point. An incomplete
    hand is worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    points.</p>
<p>In this version of the game, you are given a starting hand
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span> tiles out of the
    total <span class="tex2jax_process">$36$</span> tiles, and you
    are given one turn where you must discard a tile from your hand
    and draw a new tile from the remaining unused tiles. Given a
    starting hand and the extra point tile, find the maximal
    expected point value after drawing and discarding a single
    tile.</p>
<p>Also note that you must discard a tile even if you are dealt
    a winning starting hand.<br/></p>
<p>In the first sample input, you would output <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.863636$</span>, since if you discard the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, you complete your
    hand if you draw any tile other than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. This means that out of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$22$</span> tiles remaining,
    there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$19$</span> tiles that
    can complete the hand, and the resulting hand will be worth
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> point, so the expected
    point value after discarding the <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{19}{22} = 0.863636$</span>. An example
    of the hand that can be formed after discarding a <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and picking up a <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$3-3-3, \; \; 4-5-6, \; \; 7-8-9, \; \;
    9-9-9, \; \; 8-8$</span>. On the other hand, if you discard the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> tile instead and wait for the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, your expected value
    is lower: <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{3}{22}*3 =
    0.409091$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> that represents the
    extra point tile. (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x \leq
    9$</span>)</p>
<p>The second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span> space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ i$</span> representing the
    tiles in your starting hand. (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n_ i \leq 9$</span>)</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing a single real value representing
    the maximal expected point value of your starting hand. Your
    answer will be considered correct if it is within an absolute
    or relative error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span></p>
