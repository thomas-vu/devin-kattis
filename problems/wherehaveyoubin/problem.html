<p>Ben Bean owns Ben Bean’s Bin Bonanza which offers storage
    bins to the five big companies in town: a rubber band company,
    a Mercedes Benz dealership, a bing cherry farm, a bonbon candy
    store and a bun bakery. Together they store their bands,
    Benzes, bings, bonbons and buns in Ben’s bins.</p>
<p>Ben has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> bins
    altogether arranged in a single row, numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. While not all of the bins may be
    in use at any given time, Ben finds it useful to keep all the
    bins for one company contiguous. Thus, when a company needs a
    new bin or relinquishes one it no longer needs, Ben may need to
    move items from one bin to another to make sure all of that
    company’s bins stay next to each other. Sometimes Ben has a
    choice of which bin to move, so he has assigned a cost to each
    bin equal to the number of items stored in the bin (removing
    items from a relinquished bin and/or moving items into a new
    bin are the company’s responsibility and do not add to Ben’s
    costs). Obviously when moving bins Ben wants to keep the cost
    as low as possible.</p>
<p>If a single company has to make changes Ben can usually
    figure out the cheapest way to move items around, but typically
    at the end of each business quarter all of the five companies
    will make additions and deletions of bins as they reassess
    their product lines. In cases like this, deciding the
    lowest-cost set of moves is more difficult. Consider the
    situation in Figure 1a which shows <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> bins storing items from the five
    companies labeled A, E, I, O and U. The numbers in parentheses
    indicate the number of items in that bin (and thus the cost of
    moving the items from that bin to another). Suppose that at the
    end of the quarter company U decides it no longer needs bin
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> and company A requests
    a second bin. One possibility is to move E’s items from bin
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> to the empty bin
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> which frees up bin
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> for company A (Figure
    1b)—the cost of this rearrangement to Ben is <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>. The optimal move though is to
    move U’s items from bin <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> to bin <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and move A’s items from bin
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to bin <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> and giving company A bin
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> (Figure 1c)—the cost
    of this move is <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. Ben
    could also have moved A’s items from bin <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to bin <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> to achieve the same optimal cost.
    Notice that in all cases removing the three items from U’s bin
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> and adding the seven
    items to A’s second bin does not cost anything to Ben.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a string of characters of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 150$</span>) indicating the
    initial usage of the bins. The characters will all be from the
    set {A, E, I, O, U, X} indicating either the company using the
    bin or an empty bin (X). Following this is a row of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers indicating
    the number of items in each bin; values at locations
    corresponding to an empty bin will always be <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and values at locations
    corresponding to a company’s bin will be positive and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\leq 100$</span>. Bins for any
    one company will always be contiguous.</p>
<p>The next line starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq d \leq n$</span>) indicating the number of deletions for
    this quarter. Following this are <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> integers. Each integer specifies a
    bin which is no longer needed by a company. None will ever
    correspond to an already empty bin. On the final line is a
    positive-length string of characters indicating the new bins
    requested. If this string is a single X then no new bins are
    being requested. Otherwise the characters will all be in the
    set {A, E, I, O, U}, in no particular order, each character
    representing a request for a new bin by the corresponding
    company. There will always be enough bins to handle any set of
    changes.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimal cost required to satisfy all the bin
    changes while keeping each company’s bins contiguous.</p>
