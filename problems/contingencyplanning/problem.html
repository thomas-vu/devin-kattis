        With two zombies, there exist four different ways that at
        least one can rise from the graveyard and attack.

<p>Taking that internship in a remote mountain may not have
    been the best idea. Pulling that lever with the skull symbol
    just to see what it did was not so smart either. But now is not
    the time for regrets because you need to find a way to prepare
    for these mutant zombies fast. You need to find a way to
    survive and to do that you need to find a way to neutralize
    them.</p>
<p>Luckily you have some time to prepare before they rise from
    the cursed graveyard. You know that the graveyard will select
    at least one and up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    graves randomly and sequentially (one by one) from which a
    zombie will attack.</p>
<p>The laboratory is equipped a machine with just enough
    antidote that you can use to neutralize every zombie. But here
    is the catch: the laboratory machine needs to produce specific
    and unique antidotes for each zombie in the right order.</p>
<p>If the wrong antidote is used, the zombie will become
    stronger, and you will not live to see the next day. You need
    to count all of the orderings of subsets of zombies, so that
    the machine can pre-process the required antidote sequence for
    every possible graveyard raid containing at least one zombie
    and help you plan for contingencies in any of the possible
    sequences.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100$</span>, the number of
    cursed graves which can produce a zombie that will attack the
    laboratory.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of different possible orderings, and thus
    antidote sequences, that the zombies can raid in up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>. If the machine has
    to process more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> sequences, it will crash and
    output <tt>JUST RUN!!</tt></p>
