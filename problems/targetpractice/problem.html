<p>You are a newly designed and created robot. As a robot, you
    are excellent at shooting lasers: your lasers always go
    perfectly straight, go infinitely far, and are infinitely thin.
    To test you, the scientist who made you set out a number of
    targets for you to hit with your laser beam. The targets
    (point-like objects) are set up in a large, open room.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you are running low on battery. You only have
    enough charge left to fire two shots. The targets are
    transparent, so you might be able to shoot multiple targets
    with your laser beam. In fact, you are able to hit an infinite
    number of targets with a single shot, as long as they are on a
    straight line. In addition, you can move anywhere before and
    between the two shots. Can you figure out if it is possible to
    hit all targets with at most two shots from your laser
    beams?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 100\, 000$</span>, the number
    of targets.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    each contain two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y_ i$</span>,
    satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^9 \leq X_ i,Y_ i
    \leq 10^9$</span>. Each pair <span class="tex2jax_process">$(X_
    i,Y_ i)$</span> specifies the coordinates of one of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> targets. No two
    targets are placed at the same coordinates.</p>
<p>You may assume that height does not play a role in this
    problem.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing a single word: “<tt class="ttfamily">success</tt>” if it is possible to line up the two
    shots so that they hit all the targets, and “<tt class="ttfamily">failure</tt>” if it is not.</p>
