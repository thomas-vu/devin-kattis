<p>Daenerys frequently invents games to help teach her second
    grade Computer Science class about various aspects of the
    discipline. For this week’s lesson she has the children form a
    circle and (carefully) throw around a petrified dragon egg.</p>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> children are
    numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n - 1$</span> (it is a Computer
    Science class after all) clockwise around the circle. Child
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> always starts with the
    egg. Daenerys will call out one of two things:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>,
        indicating that the egg is to be thrown to the child who is
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> positions
        clockwise from the current egg holder, wrapping around if
        necessary. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> is
        negative, then the throw is to the counter-clockwise
        direction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the phrase <tt class="tt">undo <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span></tt>, indicating that the last
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> throws should be
        undone. Note that <tt class="tt">undo</tt> commands never
        undo other <tt class="tt">undo</tt> commands; they just
        undo commands described in item <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> above.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For example, if there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> children, and the teacher calls
    out the four throw commands <tt class="tt">8 -2 3 undo 2</tt>,
    the throws will start from child <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to child <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, then from child <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> to child <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, then from child <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to child <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>. After this, the <tt class="tt">undo 2</tt> instructions will result in the egg being
    thrown back from child <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>
    to child <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and then from
    child <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> back to child
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. If Daenerys calls out
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> (or <span class="tex2jax_process">$n, -n, 2n, -2n$</span>, etc.) then the child
    with the egg simply throws it straight up in the air and
    (carefully) catches it again.</p>
<p>Daenerys would like a little program that determines where
    the egg should end up if her commands are executed correctly.
    Don’t ask what happens to the children if this isn’t the
    case.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of two lines. The first line contains two
    positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n \leq 30$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq 100$</span>) indicating the
    number of students and how many throw commands Daenerys calls
    out, respectively. The following line contains the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> throw commands. Each command is
    either an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\, 000 \leq p \leq 10\,
    000$</span>) indicating how many positions to throw the egg
    clockwise or <tt class="tt">undo</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$m
    \geq 1$</span>) indicating that the last <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> throws should be undone. Daenerys
    never has the kids undo beyond the start of the game.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the number of the child with the egg at the end of
    the game.</p>
