</div>While visiting a traveling fun fair you suddenly have an
    urge to break the high score in the Whac-a-Mole game. The goal
    of the Whac-a-Mole game is to... well... whack moles. With a
    hammer. To make the job easier you have first consulted the
    fortune teller and now you know the exact appearance patterns
    of the moles.

    <p>The moles appear out of holes occupying the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n^2$</span> integer points <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span> satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x,y &lt; n$</span> in a
    two-dimensional coordinate system. At each time step, some
    moles will appear and then disappear again before the next time
    step. After the moles appear but before they disappear, you are
    able to move your hammer in a straight line to any position
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2, y_2)$</span> that is at
    distance at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> from
    your current position <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1,
    y_1)$</span>. For simplicity, we assume that you can only move
    your hammer to a point having integer coordinates. A mole is
    whacked if the center of the hole it appears out of is located
    on the line between <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1,
    y_1)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2,
    y_2)$</span> (including the two endpoints). Every mole whacked
    earns you a point. When the game starts, before the first time
    step, you are able to place your hammer anywhere you see
    fit.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several test cases. Each test case
    starts with a line containing three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n,d$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> are as described above, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the total number of
    moles that will appear (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n
    \leq 20$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d \le
    5$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 1\,
    000$</span>). Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each containing three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x, y$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> giving the position
    and time of the appearance of a mole (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x, y &lt; n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq t \leq 10$</span>). No two moles will
    appear at the same place at the same time.</p>
<p>The input is ended with a test case where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = d = m = 0$</span>. This case should not
    be processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case output a single line containing a single
    integer, the maximum possible score achievable.</p>
