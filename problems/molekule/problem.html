<p>Scientists in a chemical lab in Croatia have been studying
    the chemical bonds between different molecules. They have a
    special interest in a group of molecules of the chemical
    compound nitro hydrogen laminate. The compound consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> molecules bound
    together by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N - 1$</span>
    covalent bonds and all the molecules are directly or indirectly
    tied together with bonds in a single structure.</p>
<p>The scientists want to modify the compound in a way that all
    the covalent bonds are transformed into directed covalent
    bonds. Because of the instability of the newly created
    compound, each molecule will have a large number of impulses
    coming out of it and travelling to other molecules using the
    directed bonds. An impulse can travel using the directed
    covalent bond only in the direction of the bond itself.</p>

<p>The instability of the compound is defined as the largest
    possible number of bonds a single impulse can use to travel.
    The scientists want to direct the compoundâ€™s covalent bonds in
    a way that the newly created compound is as stable as possible.
    In other words, their goal is to create a compound with the
    minimal longest path an impulse can take during its travel.</p>
<p>Help the scientists determine the direction of each covalent
    bond in the compound.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 100\, 000$</span>). Each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N - 1$</span> lines contains the integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a_ i, b_ i \leq N$</span>) that
    denote that molecules <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> are
    connected with a covalent bond.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$N - 1$</span> lines,
    where each line must contain <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt> if the
    covalent bond is going to be directed from <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span>, otherwise it contains
    <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>. If there are multiple possible
    solutions, output any.</p>
