<p>Jake is learning how to play the card game Dominion. In
    Dominion, you can buy a variety of treasure, action, and
    victory point cards – at the end of the game, the player with
    the most victory points wins!</p>
<p>Each turn, each player draws <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> cards and can use their action and
    treasure cards to obtain buying power in order to buy more
    cards. Since Jake is just starting out, he’s decided to buy
    only treasure and victory point cards.</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> kinds of
    victory cards in Dominion:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Province (costs <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>, worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> victory points)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Duchy (costs <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>,
        worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> victory
        points)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Estate (costs <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>,
        worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> victory
        point)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>
    kinds of treasure cards:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Gold (costs <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>,
        worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> buying
        power)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Silver (costs <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>,
        worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> buying
        power)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Copper (costs <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>,
        worth <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> buying
        power)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the start of Jake’s turn, he draws <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> of these cards. Given the number
    of Golds, Silvers, and Coppers in Jake’s hand, calculate the
    best victory card and best treasure card he could buy that
    turn. Note that Jake can buy only one card.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case on a single line,
    which contains three non-negative integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$G
    + S + C \le 5$</span>) indicating the number of Golds, Silvers,
    and Coppers Jake draws in his hand.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the best victory card (<tt class="ttfamily">Province</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Duchy</tt>, or
    <tt class="ttfamily">Estate</tt>) and the best treasure card
    (<tt class="ttfamily">Gold</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">Silver</tt>, or <tt class="ttfamily">Copper</tt>)
    Jake can buy this turn, separated with <tt class="ttfamily">"
    or "</tt>, in this order. If Jake cannot afford any victory
    cards, output only the best treasure card he can buy.</p>
<h2>Sample Explanation</h2>
<p>In Sample Input <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>,
    Jake has <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> Silver in his
    hand, which means he has <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> buying power. This would allow him
    to either buy an Estate or a Copper.</p>
