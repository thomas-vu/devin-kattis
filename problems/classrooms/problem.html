<p>The new semester is about to begin, and finding classrooms
    for orientation activities is always a headache.</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    classrooms on campus and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> proposed activities that need to
    be assigned a venue. Every proposed activity has specfic
    starting time <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> and
    ending time <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_ i$</span>. Any
    such an activity should take place at one of the classrooms.
    Any of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> classrooms
    is big enough to hold any of the proposed activities, and each
    classroom can hold at most one activity at any time. No two
    proposed activities can take place at the same classroom at the
    same time. Even if two proposed activities overlap momentarily
    (the ending time of one activity equals the starting time
    another activity), they cannot be assigned to the same
    classroom.</p>
<p>There are so many proposed activities that there may not be
    enough classrooms to hold all the activities. It is desirable
    to have as many activities as possible. At most how many
    proposed activities can be assigned to the classrooms?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains two positive integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq n \leq 200\, 000$</span>),
        representing the number of proposed activities and number
        of classrooms, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        lines each contains two positive integers: the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th line among these
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contains
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s_ i \leq f_ i \leq
        10^9$</span>), indicating the starting time and ending time
        of proposed activity <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output an integer indicating the maximum number proposed
    activities that can be scheduled.</p>
