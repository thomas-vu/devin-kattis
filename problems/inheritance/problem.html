<p>The King of Life, the Universe and Everything is nearing the
    end of his reign. He has started planning for his eventual
    demise by getting a bunch of kids, hoping one of them will take
    over after him.</p>
<p>The king has a huge fortune of <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> suns (the currency of the
    Universe). He wants to evenly split the fortune among all his
    kids. However, he also loves the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$42$</span>. So much, in fact, that he wants
    the number of kids to consist only of the digits <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>.</p>
<p>Of course, this will put some constraints on the number of
    kids he gets. Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>,
    determine all amounts of kids the king can get and be able to
    split his fortune evenly between them in this manner.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le P \le 10^{18}$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output all the number of kids the king can get in ascending
    order, one per line.</p>
<h2>Explanation of sample 1</h2>
<p>In the first example, if the king gets <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> kids, each of them gets
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$357$</span> suns. If he instead
    gets <span class="tex2jax_process">$42$</span> kids, each of
    them gets <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span> suns. There
    is no other amount of kids he could get.</p>
