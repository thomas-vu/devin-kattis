<div class="problembody">
<p>Your sports club has a rivaling sports club in the same
    city. They did some awful things to you and you want to get
    back at them. You have learned that they are planning on doing
    a ’drop’: they drive people blindfolded to a city none of the
    participants know and tell them to find a specific place, the
    goal. They then have fun randomly walking through the city
    trying to find the goal.</p>
<p>You intend to spoil their fun thoroughly: you know that they
    promise a prize for whoever reaches the goal first, so the
    participants will use all available means to get to the goal.
    Indeed, you are fairly sure that if you set up official-looking
    signposts in that city in advance, they will probably follow
    them. You therefore decide to place signposts throughout the
    city so that no matter where the participants get dropped, they
    can follow the signposts to the goal; this takes out the
    element of ’randomly walking around’ and therefore all the
    fun.</p>
<p>However, official-looking signposts are not cheap and
    attract a lot of attention, particularly from police officers.
    So you wish to minimize the number of signposts you have to
    place in the city. This may lead the participants to use a very
    slow detour, but they don’t know the city anyway, so they won’t
    find out.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: City of 2nd and 3rd sample input. The
          2nd input has the goal at intersection 5 and the 3rd at
          4.

<p>You get yourself a map of the city and start planning. You
    notice one nice aspect of the city: all intersections are
    cross-shaped, so it is easy to predict where participants will
    go to: they will just go to the opposite side of the
    intersection they arrive at. If a participant gets dropped at
    an intersection with a signpost, he or she will follow that
    sign; otherwise they go in an arbitrary direction until they
    hit a sign post. You know that participants never get dropped
    at the goal (that would be silly).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \leq n \leq 100\, 000$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq g \leq n$</span>):
        the number of intersections and the goal, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        with four space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a, b, c, d \leq n$</span>). The
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line gives the
        intersections you end up at if you follow one of the roads
        adjacent to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
        intersection; more precisely, participants who approach the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th intersection
        coming from intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> will continue towards
        intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> and
        vice versa, while participants coming from intersection
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> will continue
        towards intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> and vice versa.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each intersection connects to four different other
    intersections.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a single integer: the smallest number of
        signposts needed to ruin the fun.</p>
</li>
</ul>
