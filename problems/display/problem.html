<p>There is a suspicion that some officers cheat when reporting
    exact time of various events. They antedate important documents
    and gain enormous profit by that. To eliminate such practices,
    ACM decided to install big digital clock on the wall of each
    office. Thank to this, everyone can easily see the current time
    and verify that it is correctly recorded on documents.</p>
<p>Your task is to write a firmware for this digital clock.
    Digits will be shown using the classical seven-segment
    display.</p>
<h2>Input Specification</h2>
<p>On each line of the input, there are exactly five
    characters: two digits, a colon (“<tt>:</tt>”) and another two
    digits. These characters specify a time between 00:00 and
    23:59, inclusive.</p>
<p>The last time is followed by a line containing the word
    “<tt>end</tt>”.</p>
<h2>Output Specification</h2>
<p>For each input line, print a display consisting of seven
    rows of exactly 29 characters each. The only characters allowed
    are dashes (“<tt>-</tt>”) for horizontal segments, pipes
    (“<tt>|</tt>”) for vertical segments, plus signs (“<tt>+</tt>”)
    for corners, small latin letter “<tt>o</tt>” for the colon
    between hours and minutes, and spaces (“ ”).</p>
<p>The area for each digit is exactly 5 characters wide and
    there are two empty columns (spaces) between neighboring digit
    areas or between a digit area and the colon. Exact digit shapes
    and placements can be seen in Sample Output.</p>
<p>Always print two empty lines after each time displayed.
    Also, print the word “<tt>end</tt>” on a line of its own at the
    end of the output.</p>
