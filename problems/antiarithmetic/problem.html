<div class="problembody">
<p>A sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{1}, a_{2},
    a_{3}, \ldots $</span> is an arithmetic progression if there
    exists a constant <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> such
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i} - a_{i+1} = c$</span>
    for <span class="tex2jax_process">$i = 1, 2, 3, \ldots
    $</span>.</p>
<p>A permutation of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is
    a bijective function of the initial <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> natural numbers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$0, 1, \ldots n-1$</span>. A permutation
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is called
    antiarithmetic if there is no subsequence of it forming an
    arithmetic progression of length greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, i.e., there are no three indices
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le i &lt; j &lt; k &lt;
    n$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$(p_{i} ,
    p_{j} , p_{k})$</span> forms an arithmetic progression.</p>
<p>For example, the sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2,
    0, 1, 4, 3)$</span> is an antiarithmetic permutation of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>. The sequence
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 5, 4, 3, 1, 2)$</span> is
    not an antiarithmetic permutation as its first, fifth and sixth
    term <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 1, 2)$</span> form an
    arithmetic progression; and so do its second, forth and fifth
    term <span class="tex2jax_process">$(5, 3, 1)$</span>.</p>
<p>Your task is to check whether a given permutation of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is antiarithmetic.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There are several test cases (at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>), followed by a line containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. Each test case is a
    line of the input file containing a natural number <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le n \le 10\, 000$</span> followed by a
    colon and then followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> distinct numbers separated by
    whitespace. All <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    numbers are nonnegative integers smaller than <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case output one line with <tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">no</tt> stating
    whether the permutation is antiarithmetic or not.</p>
