</div>Sven the Polar Bear (the mascot of the various Swedish
    national teams in science sports) plays hide and seek with
    Gloria the Hippo (the mascot from Madagascar). The game is
    played in a network of <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    caves, numbered between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m - 1$</span>. The caves are connected by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m - 1$</span> tunnels (each
    between two distinct caves), such that there is a path between
    any pair of caves.

    <p>Each round starts with Gloria hiding in one of the caves
    (except cave <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>) with
    uniform probability. Sven, starting in cave <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, then has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> seconds to find Gloria. Each
    tunnel takes some number of seconds for Sven to traverse
    depending on the length of the tunnel, and can be traversed in
    both directions.</p>
<p>Sven likes to win, so he wants to choose his movements in
    such a way that he maximizes the probability of finding Gloria
    before the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> seconds are
    up. How many caves does Sven have time to visit?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le m \le 100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 300$</span>), the number of
        caves in the network and the number of seconds Sven has to
        find Gloria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$m - 1$</span> lines with
        three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le u \not= v &lt; m$</span>,
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le t \le 300$</span>),
        the two endpoints of a tunnel and the time it takes to
        traverse the tunnel, in seconds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum number of caves Sven can visit, excluding
    the cave he starts in.</p>
