</div>In a two player card game, you have <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> minions on the board and the
    opponent has <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> minions.
    Each minion has a health between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>.
    <p>You are contemplating your next move. You want to play an
    “Explosion” spell which deals <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> units of damage randomly
    distributed across all minions. The damage is dealt one unit at
    a time to some remaining minion on the board. Each living
    minion (including your own) has the same chance of receiving
    each unit of damage. When a minion receives a unit of damage,
    its health is decreased by one. As soon as the health of a
    minion reaches zero, it is immediately removed from the board,
    before the next damage is dealt. If there are no minions left
    on the board, any excess damage caused by the spell is
    ignored.</p>
<p>Given the current health of all minions, what is the
    probability that the Explosion will remove all of the
    opponent’s minions? Note that it does not matter if all your
    own minions die in the process as well, and the damage
    continues to be dealt even if all your own minions are
    gone.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n, m \le 5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le d
    \le 100$</span>). Then follows a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers, the current health of
    all your minions. Finally, the third line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> integers, the current health of
    all the opponent’s minions. All healths are between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> (inclusive).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the probability that the Explosion removes all the
    opponent’s minions, accurate up to an absolute error of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
