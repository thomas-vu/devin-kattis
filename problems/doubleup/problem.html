<div class="problembody">
<p>A Double Up game consists of a sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, \ldots , a_ n$</span>, where each
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> is a power of two.
    In one move one can either remove one of the numbers, or merge
    two identical adjacent numbers into a single number of twice
    the value. For example, for sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$4,2,2,1,8$</span>, we can merge the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>s and obtain
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4,4,1,8$</span>, then merge the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>s and obtain
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8,1,8$</span>, then remove the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and, finally, merge
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>s, obtaining a
    single final number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span>.
    We play the game until a single number remains. What is the
    largest number we can obtain?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two lines. The first line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1000$</span>). The second line
    contains numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, \ldots ,
    a_ n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq a_
    i\leq 2^{100}$</span> for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The ouput consists of a single line containing the largest
    number that can be obtained from the input sequence
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, \ldots , a_ n$</span>.</p>
