<div class="problembody">
<p>Filip came across an interesting math problem: He was
    supposed to find a five-digit number with the following
    property. If you cross out its first two digits, then place the
    digit <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> after the
    remaining three digits to form a four-digit number and multiply
    the resulting four-digit number by <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, you will get the original
    five-digit number.</p>
<p>After thinking for a while, he found his answer. But now he
    is wondering, what if he had to find an <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>-digit number, where you have to
    cross out the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    digits, place a (possibly multi-digit) number <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> after the remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$(m-n)$</span>-digit number, then multiply
    this new number by a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> to get the original number? Please
    help him!</p>
<p>(You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> start with a non-zero digit, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is either <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> or starts with a non-zero digit.
    The <span class="tex2jax_process">$(m-n)$</span>-digit number
    also needs to start with a non-zero digit.)</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing four numbers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>. You may assume that each number
    is positive and not larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span>. You may also assume
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$m\geq n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output consists of a single line. If such an
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>-digit number exists,
    the line contains the smallest such number. If no such number
    exists, the line contains the string <tt class="tt">IMPOSSIBLE</tt>.</p>
