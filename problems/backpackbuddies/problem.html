<p>The prudent Mr. Day and adventurous Dr. Knight have decided
    to be backpack buddies and go trekking in the gorgeous
    Norwegian mountains. Of course they will use the trails marked
    by the Norwegian Trekking Association (DNT), like any sane
    trekkers would; such trails all start and end at some cabin
    where it is possible to lay over. Mr. Day for one likes
    sleeping comfortably, so he immediately suggested that they
    sleep in a cabin every night.</p>
<p>However, Dr. Knight was of a different opinion; she argued
    that they’d arrive at their destination much quicker if they
    went for as long as possible each day, and then slept in tents
    in between two cabins if need be. Even though Mr. Day agreed
    that reaching the destination as quickly as possible was
    desirable, he was not willing to sacrifice the comfort of a
    proper bed.</p>
<p>After a fierce argument, Mr. Day and Dr. Knight decided to
    split up, each to follow their own strategy. Assuming they both
    walk at the same pace, how long will Dr. Knight need to wait at
    the final destination before Mr. Day shows up?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 100\, 000$</span>) the number of cabins, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 100\, 000$</span>) the number
    of trails. Then follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each describing a trail.
    The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th such line
    contains three integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_
    i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq u_ i, v_ i &lt; n$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq d_ i \leq 12$</span>)
    meaning that there is a trail between cabin <span class="tex2jax_process">$u_ i$</span> and cabin <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> which will take exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> hours to traverse.
    (There can be more than one trail between two cabins, and some
    trails could lead back to the same cabin from where it
    started).</p>
<p>Mr. Day and Dr. Knight start in cabin <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and their destination is cabin
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. Each day they start
    walking at 08:00 in the morning, and then walks non-stop for
    (at most) <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> hours
    before settling down for the night.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the number of hours Dr. Knight
    needs to wait at the destination before Mr. Day shows up.</p>
