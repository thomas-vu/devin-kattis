<p>GME is the stock market ticker symbol for Gamestop, which is
    famously known around the world today for its short squeeze
    phenomenon. This incident caused major financial consequences
    for rich hedge funds, and brought money to many young, naive
    investors.</p>
<p>Sarah recently became interested in GME, and managed to
    obtain a list of predicted prices for the stock in the next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> days. Due to the high
    volume of trades happening with GME, major stock brokers have
    put out the following restrictions:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Only one transaction may be completed on a given
        day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After selling, you will not be able to buy on the next
        day.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You may only hold one stock at any given time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Write Sarah a program that can return the maximum profit
    while considering the restrictions put in place.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of two lines. The first will contain the
    number of predictions, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10^3$</span>)
    made for each day. The second line consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space separated integers with a
    predicted value between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^3$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum profit that can be made from the
    predictions provided.</p>
