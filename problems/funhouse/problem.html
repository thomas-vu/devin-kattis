<div class="problembody">
<p>American Carnival Makers Inc. (ACM) has a long history of
    designing rides and attractions. One of their more popular
    attractions is a fun house that includes a room of mirrors.
    Their trademark is to set up the room so that when looking
    forward from the entry door, the exit door appears to be
    directly ahead. However, the room has double-sided mirrors
    placed throughout at 45 degree angles. So, the exit door can be
    on any of the walls of the room. The set designer always places
    the entry and mirrors, but can never seem to be bothered to
    place the exit door. One of your jobs as part of the
    construction crew is to determine the placement of the exit
    door for the room given an original design.</p>
<p>The final diagram for a sample room is given below. The
    asterisk (<tt class="ttfamily">*</tt>) marks the entry way,
    lower case x’s mark the walls, the mirrors are given by the
    forward and backward slash characters (<tt class="ttfamily">/</tt> and <tt>\</tt>), open spaces with no visual
    obstructions are marked by periods (<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>), and the desired placement of the exit is
    marked with an ampersand (<tt class="ttfamily">&amp;</tt>). In
    the input diagram, there is an ’<tt class="ttfamily">x</tt>’ in
    place of the ’<tt class="ttfamily">&amp;</tt>’, since the exit
    has not yet been located. You need to alter the input diagram
    by replacing the proper ’<tt class="ttfamily">x</tt>’ with an
    ’<tt class="ttfamily">&amp;</tt>’ to identify the exit. Note
    that entrances and exits can appear on any of the walls
    (although never a corner), and that it is physically impossible
    for the exit to be the same as the entrance. (You don’t need to
    understand why this is so, although it may be fun to think
    about.)</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is composed of <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leqslant T \leqslant 40$</span>), each
    representing one room.</p>
<p>Each room will be preceded by two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \leqslant W \leqslant 20$</span> is the
    width of the room including the border walls and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \leqslant L \leqslant 20$</span> is the
    length of the room including the border walls. Following the
    specification of <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> are <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> additional lines containing the
    room diagram, with each line having <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> characters from the alphabet: {
    <tt class="ttfamily">*</tt> , <tt class="ttfamily">x</tt> ,
    <tt class="ttfamily">.</tt> , <tt class="ttfamily">/</tt> ,
    <tt>\</tt> }. The perimeter will always be comprised of walls,
    except for one asterisk (<tt class="ttfamily">*</tt>) which
    marks the entrance; the exit is not (yet) marked.</p>
<p>A line with two zeros indicates the end of input data.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, the first line will contain the word,
    <tt class="ttfamily">HOUSE</tt>, followed by a space and then
    an integer that identifies the given fun house sequentially.
    Following that should be a room diagram which includes the
    proper placement of the exit door, as marked by an ampersand
    (<tt class="ttfamily">&amp;</tt>).</p>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>In both Java and C++ the backslash character (<tt>\</tt>)
    has special meaning as an escape character within character and
    string literals. You must use the combination <tt>\\</tt> to
    express a single backslash within a character or string literal
    within source code.</p>
