<div class="problembody">
<p>An integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is a
    rotated number of some integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> if <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> can be obtained by moving some
    digits from the back of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> to the front without changing
    their order. In this case, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(n,m)$</span> is considered as a rotated
    pair. For example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1234,4123)$</span> is a rotated pair since
    you can obtain <span class="tex2jax_process">$4123$</span> by
    moving <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> from the back
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1234$</span> to the front.
    Note that both <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> do not contain leading
    zeros.</p>
<p>Given two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, your task is to
    count the number of distinct rotated pairs <span class="tex2jax_process">$(n,m)$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">${A \leq n &lt; m \leq B}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several datasets. The first line of
    the input contains the number of datasets, which is not greater
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>. The following
    lines describe the datasets.</p>
<p>Each dataset is printed in one line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">${1
    \leq A &lt; B \leq 10^6}$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each dataset, write out on one line the number of
    rotated pairs.</p>
