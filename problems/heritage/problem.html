<p>Bob has always been interested in his family history, and
    above all else his family name’s meaning. Unfortunately for
    Bob, no one else in his family has ever had any similar
    interest whatsoever. Because of this the family name seems to
    have changed at random points in time without any reason that
    Bob can find.</p>
<p>You have a dictionary of words that may make up part of
    Bob’s family name, and one or more unique meanings associated
    with each word. By concatenating one or more of these
    dictionary words to construct exactly the family name, count
    the number of different meanings associated with these
    different constructions.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and a word <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>, indicating the number of words in
    the dictionary and the family name respectively. The following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contain the
    dictionary. Each dictionary line starts with the dictionary
    word followed by an integer representing the number of meanings
    of the word.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of possible meanings Bob’s family name can
    have. As this number can be very large, output it modulo
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 007$</span>.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 1\,
        000$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each word (family name and dictionary) has a length
        between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span> characters
        (inclusive), and uses only characters a–z.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of meanings of a word in the dictionary is at
        least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and at most
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Dictionary words are distinct.</p>
