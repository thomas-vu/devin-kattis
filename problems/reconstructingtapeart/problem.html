</div>Raelynn is trying to learn the newest craze in modern
    art: Tape Art! This wonderful new type of art is created by
    taking a wooden plank and pieces of tape of different colors.
    Each artwork is constructed by taking multiple pieces of tape
    and placing them on the plank. For each color that appears in
    the artwork, only a single piece of tape is used. Tapes can be
    placed on top of each other in which case the tape placed last
    obscures already placed pieces of tape with which it overlaps.
    <p>Raelynn has decided the best way to learn is by copying
    Sheila, the world-famous tape artist. Unfortunately those
    pieces of art are under lock and key and Raelynn can see only
    pictures of these marvels. Since Raelynn is having trouble
    reverse engineering the artwork from the picture, she has hired
    you to create a set of instructions with which she can copy the
    art.</p>
<p>Since Raelynn is spoiled by the ease of IKEA catalogs she
    requires instructions to be given in the following format:
    there should only be one instruction per color of tape and
    instructions should be given in the order they should be
    executed.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line of
    this test case contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 10^5$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the length of the tape art in
    inches. The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le c_ i \le n$</span>) representing the
    color of one inch of the plank. Planks are divided into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-inch sections numbered
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <i class="itshape">any</i> set of instructions that,
    when executed, will result in the tape art given by the input.
    The set of instructions should start with the number of
    instructions that follow. Each instruction must consist of
    three numbers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$[l, r]$</span> represents the inclusive
    range on which the tape should be placed and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> represents the color of the tape
    piece.</p>
<p>Output the string “<tt class="ttfamily">IMPOSSIBLE</tt>” if
    the piece of tape art cannot be reconstructed using only one
    piece of each color (Sheila must have broken the rules to make
    it or this piece is a forgery).</p>
