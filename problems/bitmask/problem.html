<p>Masking greatly reduces the transmission of certain viruses.
    This is true for computer viruses as well. In order to protect
    binary data from infection, we must cover it up with masks!</p>
<p>Binary data can be represented as a string of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>s and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>s. A bitmask can be used to cover a
    portion of the data. Specifically, a bitmask of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m \leq n$</span> can be used to
    cover <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> consecutive bits
    in the data. To maximize protection, only well-fitting masks
    can be used. That is, each covered bit in the binary data is
    the opposite to the corresponding bit in the mask. For example,
    if the data is</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 1001\ 0110\
    1010 \]</span>
<p>then the mask <span class="tex2jax_process">$011$</span> can
    be used to cover positions <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. The mask <span class="tex2jax_process">$101$</span> can be used to cover positions
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span>.</p>
<p>The cost to produce a bitmask of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ i$</span>. Fortunately, if you have
    already produced a particular bitmask, you can make as many
    copies as you wish for free! Thus, one can produce two masks of
    101 for only <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_3$</span>.</p>
<p>What is the minimum cost to cover a particular piece of
    binary data with bitmasks? Every bit in the data must be
    covered by exactly one bitmask.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of a string of <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>s and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>s representing the binary data. The
    length of the string <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    satisfies <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq
    12$</span>. The second line of input consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_1, \ldots , C_ n$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C_ i \leq
    100$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum cost to produce the bitmasks to cover the
    binary data.</p>
