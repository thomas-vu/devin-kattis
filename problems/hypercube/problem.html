<p>Hypercube graphs are fascinatingly regular, hence you have
    devoted a lot of time studying the mathematics related to them.
    The vertices of a hypercube graph of dimension <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> are all binary strings of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, and two vertices are
    connected if they differ in a single position. There are many
    interesting relationships between hypercube graphs and
    error-correcting code.</p>
<p>One such relationship concerns the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-bit Gray Code, which is an
    ordering of the binary strings of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, defined recursively as follows.
    The sequence of words in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-bit code first consists of the
    words of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(n-1)$</span>-bit
    code, each prepended by a <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, followed by the same words in
    reverse order, each prepended by a <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>-bit Gray Code just consists of a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and a <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. For example the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-bit Gray Code is the following
    sequence:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    000,001,011,010,110,111,101,100 \]</span>
<p>Now, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-bit Gray
    Code forms a Hamiltonian path in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-dimensional hypercube, i.e., a
    path that visits every vertex exactly once (see
    FigureÂ 1).</p>

<p>You wonder how many vertices there are between the vertices
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0^ n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> zeros) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1^ n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> ones) on that path. Obviously it
    will be somewhere between <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{n-1}-1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^ n-2$</span>, since in general
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0^ n$</span> is the first
    vertex, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1^ n$</span> is
    somewhere in the second half of the path. After finding an
    elegant answer to this question you ask yourself whether you
    can generalise the answer by writing a program that can
    determine the number of vertices between two arbitrary vertices
    of the hypercube, in the path corresponding to the Gray
    Code.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line, containing:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 60$</span>),
        the dimension of the hypercube</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>two binary strings <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, both of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> appears before <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-bit Gray Code.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of code words between <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-bit Gray Code.</p>
