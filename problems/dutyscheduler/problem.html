<p>Resident Advisors (or RAs) at Virginia Tech are student
    leaders who are responsible for helping freshmen transition
    smoothly to college life. Mr. Friedel is trying to design a
    system to assist him in the process of scheduling RAs to be on
    duty every month. On each day there are exactly 2 RAs on duty.
    Unfortunately for Mr. Friedel, each RA is available only on
    specific days and can only be scheduled then. Before the end of
    each month, each RA submits a list of days with their
    availability to Mr. Friedel.</p>
<p>Your goal is to help him write a program that will take a
    list of RAs and their availabilities and assign two RAs for
    duty on each day.</p>
<p>While there is no limit for how many days each RA can be on
    duty, Mr. Friedel wants to reduce unfairness by limiting the
    imbalance between the number of days each RA is assigned.</p>
<p>Towards that goal, your program needs to minimize the
    maximum number of days to which any RAs may be assigned.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le m \le 60$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$28
    \le n \le 31$</span>) where <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number of RAs and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the total number of
    days this month. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines where each line consists of
    the name of the RA followed by an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le d \le n$</span>) denoting the number of days this RA is
    available. The remainder of the line consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> unique integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le i \le n$</span>) denoting the days on which this RA is
    available. Each RAâ€™s name is a unique string between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> characters consisting only of
    English lowercase or uppercase letters. You may assume that
    there is at least one possible assignment of RAs!</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>On the first line, output the maximum number of days on
    which any RA is assigned. Following that, you should output
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines starting with
    <tt class="ttfamily">Day k:</tt> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is the number of the day ranging
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (inclusive and in order), followed
    by a space, followed by the names of two RAs scheduled for that
    day, separated by spaces. The two RAs scheduled for a given day
    can be listed in any order.</p>
<p>If there are multiple valid assignments, you may output any
    of them!</p>
