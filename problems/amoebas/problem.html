<p>After a successful Kickstarter campaign, Sheba Arriba has
    raised enough money for her mail-order biology supply company.
    “Sheba’s Amoebas” can ship Petri dishes already populated with
    a colony of those tiny one-celled organisms. However, Sheba
    needs to be able to verify the number of amoebas her company
    sends out. For each dish she has a black-and-white image that
    has been pre-processed to show each amoeba as a simple closed
    loop of black pixels. (A loop is a minimal set of black pixels
    in which each pixel is adjacent to exactly two other pixels in
    the set; adjacent means sharing an edge or corner of a pixel.)
    All black pixels in the image belong to some loop.</p>
<p>Sheba would like you to write a program that counts the
    closed loops in a rectangular array of black and white pixels.
    No two closed loops in the image touch or overlap. One
    particularly nasty species of cannibalistic amoeba is known to
    surround and engulf its neighbors; consequently there may be
    amoebas within amoebas. For instance, each of the images in
    Figure 1 contains four amoebas.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq m,n \leq 100$</span>). This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> characters. A
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">#</tt>’ denotes a black pixel, a
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’ denotes a white pixel. For every
    black pixel, exactly two of its eight neighbors are also
    black.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display a single integer representing the number of loops in
    the input.</p>
