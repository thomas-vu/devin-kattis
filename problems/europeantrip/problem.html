<div class="problembody">
<p>After winning Vietlott, a woman decided to go on a trip to
    Europe! Let’s refer to her as <i class="itshape">Ms.
    Mask</i>.</p>
<p>Like other women, <i class="itshape">Ms. Mask</i> really
    loves shopping and guess where her first stop is? Of course, it
    is London, a dream land for shopaholics. She has already
    discovered three greatest shopping centers in London: Westfield
    Stratford City, Piccadily Arcade and Fortnum &amp; Mason. On
    the Cartesian plane, these three shopping centers can be
    depicted by three points.</p>
<p><i class="itshape">Ms. Mask</i> wants to rent a house to
    stay during the whole trip, so that the total distance from her
    house to those shopping centers are as small as possible. Help
    her find an optimal position for her house, assuming that she
    can put her house everywhere, even in Green Park or on Thames
    River!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of three lines, each line contains two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^3$</span>, inclusive) representing the
    coordinates of three shopping centers.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that those three points are not
    collinear.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Write in one line two real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> representing the place where
    <i class="itshape">Ms. Mask</i> should hire a house and
    stay.</p>
<p>Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> be the total
    distance from your point to three points given in the input,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$J$</span> be the total
    distance from jury’s point. Your answer is considered correct
    iff <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> differs from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$J$</span> at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span> in term of either absolute
    or relative value.</p>
