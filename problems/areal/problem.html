</div>Old MacDonald had a farm, and on that farm she had a
    square-shaped pasture, and on that pasture she had a cow that
    was prone to escape. So now Old MacDonald wants to set up a
    fence around the pasture. Given the area of the pasture, how
    long a fence does Old MacDonald need to buy?

    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le a \le 10^{18}$</span>), the area in square meters of Old
    MacDonaldâ€™s pasture.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the total length of fence needed for the pasture, in
    meters. The length should be accurate to an absolute or
    relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
