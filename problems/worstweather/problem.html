<p>“Man, this year has the worst weather ever!”, David said as
    he sat crouched in the small cave where we had sought shelter
    from yet another sudden rainstorm.</p>
<p>“Nuh-uh!”, Diana immediately replied in her traditional
    know-it-all manner.</p>
<p>“Is too!”, David countered cunningly.</p>
<p>Terrific. Not only were we stuck in this cave, now we would
    have to listen to those two nagging for at least an hour. It
    was time to cut this discussion short.</p>
<p>“Big nuh-uh. In fact, 93 years ago it had already rained
    five times as much by this time of year.”</p>
<p>“Duh”, David capitulated, “so it’s the worst weather in 93
    years then.”</p>
<p>“Nuh-uh, this is actually the worst weather in 23 years.”,
    Diana again broke in.</p>
<p>“Yeah, well, whatever”, David sighed, “Who cares
    anyway?”.</p>
<p>Well, dear contestants, you care, don’t you?</p>
<h2>The Problem</h2>
<p>Your task is to, given information about the amount of rain
    during different years in the history of the universe, and a
    series of statements in the form “Year <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> had the most rain since year
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>”, determine whether
    these are true, might be true, or are false. We say that such a
    statement is true if:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The amount of rain during these two years and all years
        between them is known.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It rained at most as much during year <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> as it did during year
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For every year <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z$</span>
        satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y &lt; Z &lt;
        X$</span>, the amount of rain during year <span class="tex2jax_process">$Z$</span> was less than the amount of
        rain during year <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We say that such a statement might be true if there is an
    assignment of amounts of rain to years for which there is no
    information, such that the statement becomes true. We say that
    the statement is false otherwise.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will consist of several test cases, each
    consisting of two parts.</p>
<p>The first part begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 50\, 000$</span>, indicating
    the number of different years for which there is information.
    Next follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th of these contains
    two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^9 \leq y_ i
    \leq 10^9$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq r_
    i \leq 10^9$</span> indicating that there was <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i$</span> millilitres of rain during year
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span> (note that the
    amount of rain during a year can be any nonnegative integer,
    the limitation on <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i$</span>
    is just a limitation on the input). You may assume that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i &lt; y_{i+1}$</span> for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i &lt; n$</span>.</p>
<p>The second part of a test case starts with an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 10\, 000$</span>,
    indicating the number of queries to process. The following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each contain two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^9 \leq Y &lt; X
    \leq 10^9$</span> indicating two years.</p>
<p>There is a blank line between test cases. The input is
    terminated by a case where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n =
    0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m = 0$</span>.
    This case should not be processed.</p>
<p>Technical note: Due to the size of the input, the use of
    cin/cout in C++ might be too slow in this problem. Use
    scanf/printf instead. In Java, make sure that both input and
    output is buffered.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>There should be <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines of output for each test case, corresponding to the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> queries. Queries
    should be answered with “<tt class="ttfamily">true</tt>” if the
    statement is true, “<tt class="ttfamily">maybe</tt>” if the
    statement might be true, and “<tt class="ttfamily">false</tt>”
    if the statement is false.</p>
<p>Separate the output of two different test cases by a blank
    line.</p>
