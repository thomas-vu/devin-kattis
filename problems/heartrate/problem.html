<p>A common method for determining your own heart rate is to
    place your index and third finger on your neck to the side of
    your windpipe. You then count how many beats you feel in a span
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> seconds, multiply
    that number by four and that gives you a measure of your heart
    rate in beats per minute (BPM). This method gives a good
    estimate, but is not quite accurate. In general, if you measure
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> beats in <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> seconds the BPM is calculated as
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{60b}{p}$</span>.</p>
<p>For this problem, we assume that all heart rates are
    constant and do not change. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> is the amount of time (in seconds)
    between each beat of your heart, we define your Actual Beats
    Per Minute (ABPM) as <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{60}{t}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 1000$</span>) indicating the number of cases to
    follow. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines specify one case, consisting
    of the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq b \leq 1000$</span>) as
    well as <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; p &lt; 1000$</span>) as described
    above. The value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is
    a real number specified to 4 decimal places.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, print on a single line the minimum possible
    ABPM, the calculated BPM, and the maximum possible ABPM,
    separated by a space. Your answer will be considered correct if
    its absolute or relative error does not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span>.</p>
