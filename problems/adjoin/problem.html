<p>One day your boss explains to you that he has a bunch of
    computer networks that are currently unreachable from each
    other, and he asks you, the cable expert’s assistant, to adjoin
    the networks to each other using new cables. Existing cables in
    the network cannot be touched.</p>
<p>He has asked you to use as few cables as possible, but the
    length of the cables used does not matter to him, since the
    cables are optical and the connectors are the expensive parts.
    Your boss is rather picky on cable usage, so you know that the
    already existing networks have as few cables as possible.</p>
<p>Due to your humongous knowledge of computer networks, you
    are of course aware that the latency for an information packet
    travelling across the network is proportional to the number of
    <em>hops</em> the packet needs, where a hop is a traversal
    along a single cable. And since you believe a good solution to
    your boss’ problem may earn you that long wanted promotion, you
    decide to minimise the maximum number of hops needed between
    any pair of network nodes.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line, you are given two positive integers, the
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq c \leq
    10^5$</span> of computers and the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq \ell \leq c-1$</span> of existing
    cables. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell
    $</span> lines, each line consisting of two distinct
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, the two
    computers the cables connect. You may assume that every
    computer has a unique name between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c-1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The maximum number of hops in the resulting network.</p>
