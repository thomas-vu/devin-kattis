<p>Lt. Columbo, arguably the best detective in the world,
    was faced with a problem. He was asked: if he was placed in a
    room with some number of stacks of gold-colored coins, where
    all but one stack consisted solely of tungsten coins, and the
    remaining stack consisted solely of pure gold coins, how could
    he determine which stack had the pure gold coins? Oh, excuse
    me, there’s just one more thing … he was also told he is given
    a modern penny scale and one penny. A modern version of the
    penny scale operates as follows: when you deposit a penny and
    put an object (or objects) on the scale, the machine displays
    the weight on a digital display. The scale is extremely
    accurate, down to milligrams. Every coin is the same size and
    color, but the tungsten coins weigh <span class="tex2jax_process">$29\, 260$</span> mg each and the gold coins
    weigh <span class="tex2jax_process">$29\, 370$</span> mg
    each.</p>
<p>Being the genius that he is, Columbo came up with the
    solution to figure out which stack contained the gold coins
    using a single weighing (since he has only one penny for the
    penny scale). As an example, suppose there are four stacks of
    coins labeled <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>. If he took one coin
    from stack <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, two coins
    from stack <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, three
    coins from stack <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and
    four coins from stack <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>,
    and weighed those <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    coins together on the penny scale, he could determine which
    stack had the gold coins. “How?” you might ask. Suppose all
    four stacks were tungsten. The total weight of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> coins would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$292\, 600$</span> mg. If, say, stack
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> was gold (one gold
    coin in the pile that was weighed), the total weight would be
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$292\, 710$</span> mg. If stack
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> was gold (two gold
    coins in the pile that was weighed), the total weight would be
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$292\, 820$</span> mg. So, if you
    know the number of coins being weighed and the total weight of
    those coins, you can determine which stack has the gold coins.
    Just as a reminder, given a number of stacks, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, the number of coins, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, being weighed will
    be:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ c = \frac{s(s+1)}{2}
    \]</span>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$87\, 890 \leq w \leq 147\, 774\,
    000$</span>) is the weight in milligrams reported by the scale
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq s \leq 100$</span>) is the number of
    coin stacks. The stacks are labeled <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> coins from stack <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> moved to the scale for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq s$</span>. For
    given values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, it will always be
    possible to determine which stack is composed solely of gold
    coins.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output consists of a single positive integer indicating
    which stack contains the gold coins.</p>
