<div class="problembody">
<p>Dick is <span class="tex2jax_process">$d=12$</span> years
    old. When we say this, we mean that it is at least twelve and
    not yet thirteen years since Dick was born.</p>
<p>Dick and Jane have three pets: Spot the dog, Puff the Cat,
    and Yertle the Turtle. Spot was <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> years old when Puff was born; Puff
    was <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> years old when
    Yertle was born; Spot was <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> years old when Yertle was born.
    The sum of Spot’s age, Puff’s age, and Yertle’s age equals the
    sum of Dick’s age (<span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>)
    and Jane’s age (<span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>). How
    old are Spot, Puff, and Yertle?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input line contains four non-negative integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> as defined above. All numbers are
    at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> and there
    will be at most 250 test cases.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input line, print a line containing three integers:
    Spot’s age, Puff’s age, and Yertle’s age. Ages are given in
    years, as described in the first paragraph.</p>
