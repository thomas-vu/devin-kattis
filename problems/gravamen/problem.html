<p><i class="itshape">“Next to the confrontation between two
    highly honed batteries of lawyers, jungle warfare is a stately
    minuet.” ­–Bill Veeck.</i></p>
<p>Frivolous lawsuit or legitimate litigation? That is the
    question the judge Kattis faces today as she presides over
    lawsuits between individuals and corporations.</p>
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>
    individuals and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>
    corporations involved in lawsuits that Kattis must preside over
    today. For simplicity, we label the individuals <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \dots , R$</span> and the corporations
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \dots , S$</span>. Each of
    the individuals and corporations is involved in at least one of
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> lawsuits; each
    lawsuit involves exactly one individual and one corporation,
    and in particular, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text
    {th}$</span> of these lawsuits involves the individual
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> and the corporation
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span>.</p>
<p>There has been a growing resentment among the populace that
    judges tend to be biased, and Kattis really wants to be known
    as an equitable and fair judge. For each lawsuit, she needs to
    rule in favor of one party or the other; the party she rules in
    favor of is said to have “won” the lawsuit. In an aggressive
    bid to improve her optics, she has decided to ignore the merits
    of the arguments involved (as the public is incapable of
    nuanced discussion anyway), but to rule in such a way that no
    single individual or corporation wins too many lawsuits, so as
    to avoid accusations of bias.</p>
<p>That is, she wants to make rulings with the goal of
    <i class="itshape">minimizing</i> the maximum number of
    lawsuits any single individual or corporation wins.</p>
<p>What ruling should she make for each lawsuit?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains three integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq R \leq 2\, 000$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq S \leq 2\, 000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$\max (R, S) \leq L \leq 2\, 000$</span>) the
    number of individuals, the number of corporations and the
    number of lawsuits.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> lines
    contain the descriptions of the lawsuits. In particular, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span> of these
    lines contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_
    i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq A_ i \leq
    R$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq B_ i \leq S$</span>),
    denoting that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text
    {th}$</span> lawsuit involves individual <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> and corporation <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span>.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that each individual and corporation is
    involved in at least one lawsuit. Note that it is possible for
    the same pair of one individual and one corporation to be
    involved in more than one lawsuit.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> lines, where
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span> of
    these lines contains either <tt class="ttfamily">INDV</tt>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> or <tt class="ttfamily">CORP</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_
    i$</span>, describing the party Kattis should rule in favor of
    for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span>
    lawsuit, such that the maximum number of lawsuits any single
    individual or corporation wins is minimized.</p>
<p>If there are multiple correct answers, you can output any of
    them.</p>
