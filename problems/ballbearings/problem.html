<p>The Swedish company SKF makes ball bearings. As explained by
    Britannica Online, a ball bearing is</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<p><em>“one of the two types of rolling, or anti friction,
      bearings (the other is the roller bearing).</em></p>
<p><em>Its function is to connect two machine members that
      move relative to one another so that the frictional
      resistance to motion is minimal. In many applications, one of
      the members is a rotating shaft and the other a fixed
      housing. Each ball bearing has three main parts: two grooved,
      ring like races and a number of balls. The balls fill the
      space between the two races and roll with negligible friction
      in the grooves. The balls may be loosely restrained and
      separated by means of a retainer or cage.”</em></p>

<p>Presumably, the more balls you have inside the outer ring,
    the smoother the ride will be, but how many can you fit within
    the outer ring? You will be given the inner diameter of the
    outer ring, the diameter of the balls, and the minimum distance
    between neighboring balls. Your task is to compute the maximum
    number of balls that will fit on the inside of the outer ring
    (all balls must touch the outer ring).</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> that indicates the
    number of test cases. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each describing a test
    case. Each test case consists of three positive floating point
    numbers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> is the inner diameter of the outer
    ring, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is the diameter
    of a ball, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is the
    minimum distance between balls. All parameters are in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0.0001, 500.0]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case output a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> on a line by itself, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the maximum number
    of balls that can fit in the ball bearing, given the above
    constraints. There will always be room for at least three
    balls.</p>
