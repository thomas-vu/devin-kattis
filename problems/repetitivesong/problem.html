<div class="problembody">
<p>Your younger sibling is obsessed with a fairly repetitive
    song. They claim that it is not repetitive, so you decided to
    prove your point by finding the longest (in terms of the number
    of words) subsequence of the song that your sibling cannot
    definitively identify within the full song lyrics.</p>
<p>More formally, a length-<span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell
    $</span> subsequence of a song with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> words is a tuple of <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s_1 &lt; s_2 &lt; \cdots &lt; s_\ell
    \leq n$</span> identifying the words in the subsequence. The
    subsequence is non-identifiable if there exists a different
    length-<span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> subsequence
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq t_1 &lt; t_2 &lt; \cdots
    &lt; t_ L \leq n$</span> (with <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i \neq t_ i$</span> for at least one
    index <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>) where word
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1$</span> in the song is
    identical to word <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1$</span>,
    word <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_2$</span> is identical to
    word <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_2$</span>, etc.</p>
<p>Given the lyrics for a song, print the length of the longest
    non-identifiable subsequence.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \leq 10^5$</span>) specifying the
    number of words in the song lyrics.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains one word of the song lyrics, given in order.
    Each word consists of up to 20 uppercase (<tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>–<tt class="ttfamily">Z</tt>) and lowercase
    (<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>–<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>)
    letters. The same word may appear on multiple lines. If two
    words do not match exactly (including the use of upper and
    lower case) then they are considered to be different words.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell
    $</span>, the number of words in the longest non-identifiable
    song subsequence. If all of the song’s subsequences are
    identifiable, print <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.
    When determining if a subsequence is identifiable, treat two
    words in the lyrics as identical if each of their corresponding
    characters are identical (in other words, case <em>does</em>
    matter).</p>
