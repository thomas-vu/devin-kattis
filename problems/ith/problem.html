<p>Did you know that during the ACM-ICPC World Finals a big
    chessboard is installed every year and is available for the
    participants to play against each other? In this problem, we
    will test your basic chess-playing abilities to verify that you
    would not make a fool of yourself if you advance to the World
    Finals. Let us centrate on queens. As you probably know, the
    queens may move not only horizontally and vertically, but also
    diagonally. You are given a chessboard with <span class="tex2jax_process">$i-1$</span> queens already placed and your
    task is to find all squares that may be used to place the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th queen such that it
    cannot be captured by any of the others.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several tasks, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>. Each task begins with a line
    containing three integer numbers separated by a space:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X, Y, N$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> give the chessboard size,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq X, Y \leq 20\,
    000$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N = i-1$</span> is
    the number of queens already placed, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq N\leq \min (X\cdot Y, 20\,
    000)$</span>. After the first line, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, each containing two numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ k, y_ k$</span> separated by
    a space. They give the position of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>-th queen, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq x_ k \leq X, 1\leq y_ k\leq Y$</span>.
    You may assume that those positions are distinct, i.e., no two
    queens share the same square. The last task is followed by a
    line containing three zeros.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each task, output one line containing a single integer
    number: the number of squares which are not occupied and do not
    lie on the same row, column, or diagonal as any of the existing
    queens.</p>
