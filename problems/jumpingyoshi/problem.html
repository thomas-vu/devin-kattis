<p>Yoshi is a frog. He lives in the ZOO under a log which was
    specially transported there from a distant equatorial
    rainforest. The log is big and wet and attracts the flies and
    that is what makes Yoshi satisfied.</p>
<p>There is also a line of pebbles which runs through the
    wetland in front of the log. There are various dark spots on
    the pebbles and sometimes Yoshi likes to look at them and dream
    that they are not just spots but some really big flies
    instead.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Yoshi’s friend camel Addawser came to see him and
    suggested to play a game.</p>
<p>“Do you see those spots on the pebbles?” asked Addawser. “I
    challenge you to start on the leftmost pebble and then do some
    jumps from a pebble to another pebble but with some
    restrictions. You can jump from a pebble to another one only if
    the sum of numbers of spots on both pebbles is equal to the
    distance between the pebbles. And you have to get to as distant
    pebble as possible.”</p>
<p>“All right, but you know that I can count at most to twenty
    three and no more,” hesitated Yoshi.</p>
<p>“No problem, I will help you with the bigger numbers,” said
    Addawser.</p>
<p>“Then, it’s easy,” said Yoshi, positioning himself on the
    first pebble and looking inquisitively over the rest of the
    line. “Although, one might not be quite so sure, after all,” he
    added after a while.</p>
<p>You are given the sequence of numbers of dark spots on the
    pebbles in the line. You are asked to find the most distant
    pebble which can be reached by a sequence of jumps. The first
    jump starts at the first pebble in the line and a jump between
    two pebbles is possible if and only if the sum of numbers of
    spots on both pebbles is equal to the distance between them.
    You may suppose that the line of pebbles is straight and that
    the distance between each two neighboring pebbles is exactly
    one frog distance unit.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each case starts with a line containing one integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 1\, 000\, 000$</span>)
    representing the number of pebbles. The second line contains a
    list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers. The
    order of the integers in the list is the same as the order of
    the pebbles in the wetland, each integer represents the number
    of spots on the corresponding pebble. No pebble contains more
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> spots. Suppose
    that Addawser knows all different pairs of pebbles where Yoshi
    can perform a jump from one pebble to another one during his
    sequence of jumps. You are guaranteed that the number of those
    pairs of pebbles never exceeds <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single line with one integer denoting the distance
    of the pebble which can be reached by successive jumps
    according to the given rules and which is the most distant from
    the first pebble.</p>
