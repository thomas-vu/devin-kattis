<p>Balaji and his coworkers like to play Foosball on their
    lunch break. Foosball is a game typically played by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> players (individual
    matchup) or <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> players
    (team play). However, due to the increasing interest and
    availability of coworkers, Balaji has created a new variation
    that supports <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> or more
    players. Each individual point is played by four players: two
    on the White team and two on the Black team.</p>

<p>The remaining players wait in line for their turn to play.
    On each point, the players on the scoring team switch positions
    (e.g., if White scores the point, then the White Offense player
    becomes the White Defense player, and vice versa). The Offense
    player of the team that lost the point becomes the Defense
    player of the same team, while the Defense player of the team
    that lost the point goes to the back of the line and waits for
    their next chance to play. The person at the front of the line
    becomes the new Offense player of the team that lost the
    point.</p>
<p>Based on these rules, a team that continues scoring
    consecutive points gets to keep playing together (swapping
    positions with each other after each point) until the other
    team breaks the streak. Each such streak of points creates a
    <em>dynasty</em> for the winning team. Dynasties can be
    short-lived (a single point) or long-lived, but they are always
    broken when the opposing team scores a point. The “winners” of
    this variation of foosball are the players that can create the
    longest dynasty.<br/></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> representing the number of players
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \leq n \leq 10$</span>). The
    next line contains the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    names of all participating players. The first four are the
    names of the four players who initially arrive at the table (in
    that order): the first person to arrive starts at White
    Offense, the second starts at Black Offense, the third starts
    at White Defense, and the fourth starts at Black Defense. The
    remaining players get in line to wait for their turn. The final
    input line contains a non-empty string indicating which side
    scored each point, with a White team point represented by ‘W’
    and a Black team point represented by ‘B’. The maximum length
    of this string will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the team that has achieved the longest dynasty. If
    more than one team ties for the record, then display each of
    these teams in chronological order of when the record was set,
    one team per line. When displaying a team, names should be
    displayed in the order in which the players arrived at the
    table for that team. Note that it is possible for the same team
    to appear more than once in the output, potentially with the
    player names in a different order.</p>
