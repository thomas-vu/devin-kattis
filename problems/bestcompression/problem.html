<p>Being educated in Computer Science and Mathematics is not
    always easy. Especially not if you have “friends” who
    repeatedly insist on showing you their new “proofs” that P
    equals NP, that the Riemann Hypothesis is true, and so on.</p>
<p>One of your friends recently claims to have found a
    fantastic new compression algorithm. As an example of its
    amazing performance, your friend has told you that every file
    in your precious collection of random bit strings after
    compression would be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> bits long! Naturally, you find
    this a bit hard to believe, so you want to determine whether it
    is even theoretically possible for this to be true.</p>
<p>Your collection of random bit strings consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> files, no two of which
    are identical, and each of which is exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span> bits long.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 10^{15}$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le b \le 50$</span>), giving the number of files in your
    collection and the maximum number of bits a compressed file is
    allowed to have.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a line containing either “<tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt>” if it is possible to compress all the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> files in your
    collection into files of size at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> bits, or “<tt class="ttfamily">no</tt>” otherwise.</p>
