<p>A mobile is a type of kinetic sculpture constructed to take
    advantage of the principle of equilibrium. It consists of a
    number of rods, from which weighted objects or further rods
    hang. The objects hanging from the rods balance each other, so
    that the rods remain more or less horizontal. Each rod hangs
    from only one string, which gives it freedom to rotate about
    the string.</p>
<p>We consider mobiles where each rod is attached to its string
    exactly in the middle, as in the figure underneath. You are
    given such a configuration, but the weights on the ends are
    chosen incorrectly, so that the mobile is not in equilibrium.
    Since thatâ€™s not aesthetically pleasing, you decide to change
    some of the weights.</p>

<p>What is the minimum number of weights that you must change
    in order to bring the mobile to equilibrium? You may substitute
    any weight by any (possibly non-integer) weight. For the mobile
    shown in the figure, equilibrium can be reached by changing the
    middle weight from 7 to 3, so only 1 weight needs to
    changed.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of
    testcases, at most 100. After that per testcase:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with the structure of the mobile, which is a
        recursively defined expression of the form:</p>
<center>
<span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \langle
          \texttt{expr}\rangle \; \; ::= \; \; \langle
          \texttt{weight}\rangle \; \; \mid \; \; \mbox{``[''} \;
          \langle \texttt{expr}\rangle \; \mbox{``,''} \; \langle
          \texttt{expr}\rangle \; \mbox{``]''} \]</span>
</center>
<p>with <span class="tex2jax_process">$\langle
        \texttt{weight}\rangle $</span> a positive integer smaller
        than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> indicating
        a weight and <span class="tex2jax_process">$[\langle
        \texttt{expr}\rangle ,\langle \texttt{expr}\rangle
        ]$</span> indicating a rod with the two expressions at the
        ends of the rod. The total number of rods in the chain from
        a weight to the top of the mobile will be at most 16.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per testcase:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with the minimum number of weights that have to
        be changed.</p>
