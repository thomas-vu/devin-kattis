<p>You may have wondered why most extraterrestrial life forms
    resemble humans, differing by superficial traits such as
    height, colour, wrinkles, ears, eyebrows and the like. A few
    bear no human resemblance; these typically have geometric or
    amorphous shapes like cubes, oil slicks or clouds of dust.</p>
<p>The answer is given in the 146th episode of <em>Star Trek -
    The Next Generation</em>, titled <em>The Chase</em>. It turns
    out that in the vast majority of the quadrant’s life forms
    ended up with a large fragment of common DNA.</p>
<p>Given the DNA sequences of several life forms represented as
    strings of letters, you are to find the longest substring that
    is shared by more than half of them.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Standard input contains several test cases. Each test case
    begins with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le
    100$</span>, the number of life forms. <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines follow; each contains a
    string of lower case letters representing the DNA sequence of a
    life form. Each DNA sequence contains at least one and not more
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 006$</span> letters and
    consists solely of lower case ’a’-’z’. A line containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> follows the last test
    case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the longest string or strings
    shared by more than half of the life forms. If there are many,
    output all of them in alphabetical order. If there is no
    solution with at least one letter, output “?”. Leave an empty
    line between test cases.</p>
