<div class="problembody">
<p>You are the boss of <span class="scshape">ACM</span>
    (Association for the Country of Mububa), an upstanding company
    with a single goal of world domination.</p>
<p>Today, you have conquered the unnamed country of Mububa (how
    an unnamed country has a name is, of course, outside the scope
    of this problem). Mububa is known for its great, great,
    bananas. In light of this monumental achievement, you have
    decided to reward your executives with Mububaâ€™s greatest
    treasure (which is obviously, bananas). You have prepared
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> briefcases, each
    contains a number of bananas. These briefcases are numbered
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<p>You reward your executives one by one in order from the
    least evil executive, to the most evil executive (still not
    comparably evil to you, of course). No two executives are
    equally evil. For each executive, you first decide how many
    briefcases you want to give him. If you decide to give an
    executive <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> briefcases,
    you give him the <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
    briefcases with lowest numbers that you still have. Each
    executive you reward must receive at least one briefcase.</p>
<p>It is important to be fair when distributing rewards. You do
    not want your executives to stage a hunger strike, after all.
    Thus, the rewards the executives received must reflect how evil
    they are. More rigorously, if executive <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> is more evil than executive
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, then the total number
    of bananas received by executive <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> must be at least as large as the
    total number of bananas received by executive <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>.</p>
<p>You know the number of bananas inside all of the briefcases.
    You want to reward as many executives as possible, but wants
    the distribution to still be fair (i.e. following the previous
    requirement) amongst them. What is the maximum number of
    executives you can reward this way?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a non-negative integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 3\, 000$</span>, giving the
    number of briefcases you have. Then follows a line with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th of which denotes
    the number of bananas in briefcase number <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. Each briefcase contains between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> bananas, inclusively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the maximum number of executives you can reward with
    bananas.</p>
<h3>Sample Data explanation</h3>
<p>In the first example, give briefcase <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to the least evil executive,
    briefcase <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> to the
    second least evil executive, and briefcases <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> to the most evil executive.</p>
<p>In the second example, give briefcase <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to the least evil executive,
    briefcases <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> to the second least
    evil executive, and briefcases <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> to the most evil executive.</p>
