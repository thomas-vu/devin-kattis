<p>A <em>Doublet</em> is a pair of words that differ in exactly
    one letter; for example, “booster” and “rooster” or “rooster”
    and “roaster” or “roaster” and “roasted”.</p>
<p>You are given a dictionary of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$25\, 143$</span> lower case words, not
    exceeding <span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span> letters
    each. You are then given a number of pairs of words. For each
    pair of words, find the shortest sequence of words that begins
    with the first word and ends with the second, such that each
    pair of adjacent words is a doublet. For example, if you were
    given the input pair “booster” and “roasted”, a possible
    solution would be: (“booster”, “rooster”, “roaster”, “roasted”)
    provided that these words are all in the dictionary.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of the dictionary (with at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$25\, 143$</span> words) followed by a number
    of word pairs (at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>). The dictionary consists of a
    number of words, one per line, and is terminated by an empty
    line. The pairs of input words follow; the words of each pair
    occur on a line separated by a space.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input pair, print a set of lines starting with the
    first word and ending with the last. Each pair of adjacent
    lines must be a doublet. If there are several minimal
    solutions, any one will do. If there is no solution, print a
    line: “<tt class="ttfamily">No solution.</tt>” Leave a blank
    line between cases.</p>
