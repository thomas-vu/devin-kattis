<div class="problembody">
<p>You are a member of the Senate of an ancient empire governed
    by a mighty dictator. You have joined a bipartisan secret
    committee of the Senate that is plotting to overthrow the
    dictator.</p>
<p>In order for the plot to succeed, it is crucial that all the
    states in the empire ultimately support the planâ€“and to
    accomplish this, the governors of all the states need to be
    members of the same Party.</p>
<p>Right now, each state governor is a member of either the
    Orange Party or the Purple Party. Since you are confident that
    you can get either party to back the plot, it does not matter
    which party ultimately prevails.</p>
<p>The secret committee has studied the political situation and
    determined that two governors will influence each other if they
    are friends with each other and members of the same Party. To
    get all the state governors on board, each month a lobbyist
    will do whatever it takes to get one governor to switch
    parties. When this happens, all the friends of the governor who
    are members of the same Party will also switch affiliation, as
    will the friends of the friends within the party, and so on. To
    avoid suspicion, the secret committee will alternate
    Orange/Purple lobbyists each month. They may start the ball
    rolling with either party in the first month.</p>
<p>The secret committee also knows which governors are friends
    with each other, that each governor is friends with at least
    one other governor, and that there are no isolated groups that
    are only friends with each other.</p>
<p>Your task is to determine the minimum number of months
    required for all the state governors to be members of the same
    party. Once this occurs, the next steps in the plot can take
    place.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There will be a single test case in the input. This test
    case will begin with a line with two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 100$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1 \le m \le n(n-1)/2$</span>), where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of
    governors, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the
    number of known friendships. On the next line will be
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers, either
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, indicating the current party
    affiliation of the governors, in order (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0=\text {ORANGE}, 1=\text {PURPLE}$</span>).
    On each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines will be two integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le a &lt; b \le n$</span>) indicating that governor
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and governor
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> are friends. As in
    life, friendships go both ways: if <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is a friend of <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> is also a friend of <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>. All <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a,b)$</span> pairs will be unique.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, indicating the minimum number of
    months necessary for every governor to belong to the same
    party.</p>
