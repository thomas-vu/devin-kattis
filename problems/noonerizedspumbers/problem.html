<p>Everyone has heard of spoonerisms, named after William
    Archibald Spooner, an Oxford professor who had a habit of
    swapping prefixes of words, often with comical results. “May I
    show you to your seat?” became “May I sew you to your sheet?”
    and “a crushing blow” became “a blushing crow.”</p>
<p>Just imagine him as a student of arithmetic, occasionally
    swapping the prefixes of the numbers he was calculating with
    and then wondering why his equations never made any sense. For
    instance, when he writes:</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth ]{add1.png}" src="/problems/noonerizedspumbers/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:30.00%"/>
</center>
<p>what he really intended to write was:</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=.3\textwidth ]{add2.png}" src="/problems/noonerizedspumbers/file/statement/en/img-0002.png" style="width:30.00%"/>
</center>
<p>(He swapped prefixes “<span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>” and “<span class="tex2jax_process">$669$</span>” in the first and third
    numbers.) And when he writes:</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=.35\textwidth ]{multiply1.png}" src="/problems/noonerizedspumbers/file/statement/en/img-0003.png" style="width:35.00%"/>
</center>
<p>what he really intended to write was:</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=.35\textwidth ]{multiply2.png}" src="/problems/noonerizedspumbers/file/statement/en/img-0004.png" style="width:35.00%"/>
</center>
<p>(He swapped the prefix “<span class="tex2jax_process">$72$</span>” with the prefix “<span class="tex2jax_process">$68$</span>” in the first and second
    numbers.)</p>
<p>Grading homework from young Mr. Spooner is quite a
    challenge. Fleas pined a way to help!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing an expression
    of the form “<span class="tex2jax_process">$x + y = z$</span>”
    or “<span class="tex2jax_process">$x * y = z$</span>”, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span> are positive integers less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{31}$</span>. There will be
    single spaces surrounding the “<span class="tex2jax_process">$+$</span>” and “<span class="tex2jax_process">$*$</span>” operators and the “<span class="tex2jax_process">$=$</span>” sign. The expression will not be
    a mathematically correct equation.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a mathematically correct equation consisting of the
    input line modified by swapping proper prefixes of two of the
    three numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span>. (A proper prefix of a string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is a prefix that is
    neither empty nor equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>.) Separate the numbers, operators,
    and the “<span class="tex2jax_process">$=$</span>” sign with
    single spaces. All integers in the correct equation will be
    non-negative and less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{31}$</span>. There is guaranteed to be
    only one possible correct equation that can be formed by
    swapping proper prefixes.</p>
