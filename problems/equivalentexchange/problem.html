<p>Two brothers, who seek to increase their understanding of
    alchemy, were left stranded on a deserted island by their
    mentor. With no other way to survive, they try to use their
    abilities to gather resources.</p>
<p>They’ve documented their stay over <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> days, tracking how many of each
    item they have. They’ve given each item an integer ID, ranging
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>. On the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th day, one of two things
    happen:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>The younger brother finds one of item <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_ i$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The older brother transmutes all their stock of item
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> to item
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>As they depart the island, they wish to look back on what
    they’ve learned so far. To do so, they take inventory of the
    items they’ve gathered one last time. Can you do the same?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$</span>, the
    number of days. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> lines each contain a query. Each
    of these lines contains a series of space-separated integers.
    The first integer is <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i \in \{
    1, 2\} $</span>, the type of query.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i = 1$</span>, the
        next integer is <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_
        i$</span>. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one
        query of this type.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i = 2$</span>, the
        next two integers are <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_
        i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_
        i$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Let the days where some item was found be <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, x_2, \dots , x_ n$</span>. Print
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines. On the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th line, print the
    final item ID of the item found on day <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>.</p>
