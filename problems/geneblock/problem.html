        Block Trade
      </div>
</div>
<p>You discovered that you could easily trade a big dirt block
    of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> for one of the
    rarest Minecraft blocks, Gene. Although excessively abundant,
    dirt blocks in this server come in different sizes â€” and, after
    careful observation, you realized that the size of each
    individual dirt block is always a positive integer that ends
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>, i.e.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$27$</span>, etc. What is the minimum number
    of dirt blocks you need to trade for the Gene block?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq t \leq 405$</span>, giving the number
    of test cases to follow. Each case consists of one line
    containing a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; N \leq 10^9 $</span>, the size of the dirt block you need
    to make in order to trade for the Gene block.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing a single
    number, the minimum number of dirt blocks you need to trade for
    the Gene block, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> if
    it cannot be done.</p>
