<p>Quicksort is a recursive sorting algorithm developed in 1959
    by Tony Hoare. One of the major steps in the algorithm is the
    <em>partition </em> step: given an element <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> in the array (the <em>pivot </em>
    element) rearrange the elements in the array as shown below
    where all the values in <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_
    L$</span> are <span class="tex2jax_process">$\leq p$</span> and
    all elements in <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_ R$</span> are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$&gt; p$</span>.</p>

<p>Figure 1 below shows an array before and after it’s been
    partitioned with the pivot element <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span>. Note that the elements in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_ L$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_ R$</span> are typically not in sorted
    order and either one of them could be empty.</p>

<p>How a partition is executed and how a pivot element is
    selected are fascinating questions but are not of interest to
    us. What we would like you to do is the following: given an
    array, determine all the values that could be the pivot value
    assuming the array has been partitioned, or determine that the
    array has not been partitioned.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\leq n\leq 10^6)$</span> denoting the size
    of the array. Following this are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> positive integers indicating the
    values in the array. All values are unique and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\leq 10^6$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$m =$</span> the number
    of values in the array that could have served as pivot values
    to partition the array, followed by the pivot values in the
    order that they appear in the input. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$m &gt; 100$</span> just output the first 100
    of these pivot values. Note that a value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$m=0$</span> indicates that the array is not
    partitioned.</p>
