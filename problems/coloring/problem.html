</div>To address the impending STEM shortage early on, your
    local elementary school decided to teach graph theory to its
    kindergarten students! To tap into their age-specific skills,
    the students are asked to color the vertices of a graph with
    colors of their own choosing. There is one constraint, however:
    they cannot use the same color for two vertices if those
    vertices are connected by an edge. Furthermore, they are asked
    to use as few different colors as possible. The illustration
    shows a few examples of student work.

    <p>There is one problem, as you can imagine: there is no money
    to train teachers to grade these studentsâ€™ submissions! Thus,
    your task is to write a program that computes the sample
    solutions for the graphs given on each work sheet!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a description of a single graph. The
    first line contains a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 11$</span>), the number of vertices in the graph.
    Vertices are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \ldots
    N-1$</span>. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contain one or more numbers
    each. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> line
    contains a list of vertex numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">${ v_ j }$</span>, denoting edges from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ i$</span> to each
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ j$</span> in the list. You
    may assume that the graph is connected (there is a path between
    any two pairs of vertices).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum number of colors required to color all
    vertices of the graph such that no vertices that share an edge
    are colored using the same color!</p>
<p>The sample input corresponds to the graphs shown on the
    illustration.</p>
