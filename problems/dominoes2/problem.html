<p>Dominoes are lots of fun. Children like to stand the tiles
    on their side in long lines. When one domino falls, it knocks
    down the next one, which knocks down the one after that, all
    the way down the line. However, sometimes a domino fails to
    knock the next one down. In that case, we have to knock it down
    by hand to get the dominoes falling again.</p>
<p>Given a set of dominoes that are knocked down by hand, your
    task is to determine the total number of dominoes that
    fall.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer specifying the
    number of test cases to follow. Each test case begins with a
    line containing three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n, m, l$</span> no larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>+<span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> additional lines. The first
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number
    of domino tiles. The domino tiles are numbered from 1 to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
    after the first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> indicating that if domino number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> falls, it will cause
    domino number <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> to fall
    as well. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> lines contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span> indicating that the
    domino numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span> is
    knocked over by hand.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing one integer,
    the total number of dominoes that fall over.</p>
