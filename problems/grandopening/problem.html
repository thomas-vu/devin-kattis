<p>You are the proud owner of the new Multispecies Animal
    Protection Sanctuary (MAPS). As you arrive on the morning of
    the grand opening, you realize with horror that some of the
    animals are in the wrong enclosures. You will deal with the
    overnight zookeeper later, but right now you need to move all
    of the animals back to their proper areas before the zoo
    opens.</p>
<p>You may choose to begin at any of the enclosures, and you
    must move the animals, one at a time, back to their respective
    areas. Since time is of the essence, you cannot travel from one
    enclosure to another unless you are moving an animal directly
    back to its proper area. Note that the zoo is laid out in such
    a fashion that it is always possible to travel from one
    enclosure to another without passing through any other
    enclosures.</p>
<p>Determine if it is possible to return all of the animals
    back to their proper enclosures subject to these
    restrictions.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two space-separated
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 10\, 000$</span> denotes the
    number of different enclosures and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq m\leq 50\, 000$</span> denotes the
    total number of animals in the zoo. Each of the next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines gives the
    starting state of a different enclosure. Each enclosure is
    described on a single line using a series of space-separated
    tokens. The first token is a string indicating which type of
    animal belongs in this particular enclosure. The second token
    is a non-negative integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, identifying the number of animals
    currently in this enclosure. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> tokens on the same line, each of
    which is a string indicating the type of one of the animals
    currently in this enclosure.</p>
<p>Each animal type is composed of lowercase letters
    (<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>–<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>) and
    contains between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> characters, inclusive.
    Each animal in the zoo belongs to exactly one enclosure, and
    that may or may not correspond to the enclosure that the animal
    is currently in.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If at least one animal is not in its proper enclosure,
    output “<tt class="ttfamily">POSSIBLE</tt>” if it is possible
    to restore all of the animals back to their proper locations
    under the above restrictions; otherwise, output “<tt class="ttfamily">IMPOSSIBLE</tt>”. If all the animals are already in
    their proper enclosures, output “<tt class="ttfamily">FALSE
    ALARM</tt>” instead.</p>
