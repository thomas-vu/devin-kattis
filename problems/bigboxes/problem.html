<p>Brandon Greg Jr. is moving to the United States to double
    his salary. He has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    items that he needs to pack into <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> big boxes. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> items are currently arranged in a
    row, and Brandon doesnâ€™t want to bother reordering them, so he
    will partition the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    items into <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> groups of
    consecutive items, and put each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> groups into their own box. For
    convenience when moving, Brandon wants to minimize the weight
    of the heaviest box. The weights of the boxes themselves are
    negligible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le k\le n\le 10^5$</span>), denoting the
    number of items and the number of boxes respectively.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le w_ i\le 10^4$</span>), representing the
    weight of each item in order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The only line of output should contain a single integer,
    denoting the minimum possible weight of the heaviest box.</p>
