<div class="problembody">
<p>Anthony and his friends have been arguing among themselves
    on who has the better space-car. They decided to settle on
    having a competition on an alien planet to finally settle who
    has the best space-car. This alien planet is unique as it has
    no atmosphere, thereby removing air resistance, and the barren
    land also removes the friction on the car, making it perfect
    for a space race! To decide this, they need you to make a
    program which calculates the most efficient space-car. To do
    this they have given you two formulas!</p>
<p>The rate of fuel is equal to the fuel consumed divided by
    the time taken. The efficiency is equal to the velocity divided
    by the rate of fuel.</p>
<p>The winner is decided by the highest efficiency. Anthony and
    his friends are counting on you!!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input will contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of space-cars
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 15$</span>). The
    second line of input will contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is an decimal distance amount from
    start to end (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2000 \leq d \leq
    9999$</span>). The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines of input will contain the
    unique initials of the racer (2 uppercase letters), followed by
    a decimal <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> which
    represents the velocity of the ship (<span class="tex2jax_process">$100 \leq v \leq 999$</span>), which is also
    followed by a decimal <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
    that represents the fuel consumed (<span class="tex2jax_process">$100 \leq r \leq 999$</span>). All decimals
    have at most four digits after the decimal point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should be one line which is the initials of the
    racer with the most efficient space-car. It is guaranteed that
    there is only one winner.</p>
