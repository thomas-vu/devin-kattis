</div>Your slightly pointy-bearded boss has assigned you to
    write software to find the best songs from different music
    albums. And the software should be finished in an hour. But
    don’t panic, you don’t have to solve the problem of writing an
    AI with good taste. At your disposal is the impeccable taste of
    a vast horde of long-tailed monkeys. Well, at least almost. The
    monkeys are not very communicative (or rather, you’re not sure
    which song “Ook!” is supposed to refer to) so you can’t ask
    them which songs are the best. What you can do however is to
    look at which songs the monkeys have listened to and use this
    information to deduce which songs are the best.

    <p>At first, you figure that the most listened to songs must be
    the best songs. However, you quickly realize that this approach
    is flawed. Even if all songs of the album are equally good, the
    early songs are more likely to be listened to more often than
    the later ones, because monkeys will tend to start listening to
    the first song, listen for a few songs and then, when their
    fickle ears start craving something else, stop listening.
    Instead, if all songs are equal, you expect that their play
    frequencies should follow <em>Zipf’s Law</em>.</p>
<p>Zipf’s Law is an empirical law originally formulated about
    word frequencies in natural languages, but it has been observed
    that many natural phenomena, such as population sizes and
    incomes, approximately follow the same law. It predicts that
    the relative frequency of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th most common object (in this
    case, a song) should be proportional to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/i$</span>.</p>
<p>To illustrate this in our setting, suppose we have an album
    where all songs are equally good. Then by Zipf’s Law, you
    expect that the first song is listened to twice as often as the
    second song, and more generally that the first song is listened
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> times as often as
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th song. When some
    songs are better than others, those will be listened to more
    often than predicted by Zipf’s Law, and those are the songs
    your program should select as the good songs. Specifically,
    suppose that song <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> has
    been played <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_ i$</span> times
    but that Zipf’s Law predicts that it would have been played
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$z_ i$</span> times. Then you
    define the quality of song <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to be <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_ i = f_ i/z_ i$</span>. Your software
    should select the songs with the highest values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_ i$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 50\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le m \le n$</span>), the number of songs on the album, and the
    number of songs to select. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th of these lines contains an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$f_ i$</span> and string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le f_ i \le 10^{12}$</span> is the number
    of times the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th song
    was listened to, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_
    i$</span> is the name of the song. Each song name is at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> characters long and
    consists only of the characters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>’-‘<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>’, ‘<tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>’-‘<tt class="ttfamily">9</tt>’, and
    underscore (‘<tt class="ttfamily">_</tt>’).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a list of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> songs with the highest quality
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_ i$</span>, in decreasing
    order of quality. If two songs have the same quality, give
    precedence to the one appearing first on the album (presumably
    there was a reason for the producers to put that song before
    the other).</p>
