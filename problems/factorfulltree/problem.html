<p>Aivar is very good at number theory. In fact, it is the only
    thing he is good at, but this doesnâ€™t stop him from achieving
    great things. However, if Aivar wants to solve any problem in
    life, he first needs to convert it to number theory.</p>
<p>For example, consider a rooted tree with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> vertices. In order to deal with
    such structures, Aivar first constructs a <i class="itshape">divisor labelling</i> of the tree. A divisor
    labelling is a way to label each vertex <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> with a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ v$</span> so that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> is an ancestor of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> if and only if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ v$</span> divides
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ u$</span>.</p>
<p>After constructing such a labelling, Aivar can simply forget
    about the tree and just think about the list of numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, x_2, \dots , x_
    N$</span>.</p>
<p>You are given a rooted tree with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> vertices, and your task is to find
    a divisor labelling. The vertices are numbered from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is the root.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 60$</span>).</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span>
    lines each contain two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq u, v \leq N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$u \neq
    v$</span>), meaning that an edge goes between vertices
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>. These edges will form a tree.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    integers, the numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, x_2,
    \dots x_ N$</span>. These numbers must satisfy <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x_ i \leq 10^{18}$</span>. It can be
    shown that under these constraints, an answer always
    exists.</p>
