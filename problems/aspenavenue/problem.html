</div>“Phew, that was the last one!” exclaimed the garden
    helper Tim as he threw the last tree plant to the ground. His
    employer, countess Esmeralda Hunt who owned the estate, has
    ordered him to arrange an avenue of aspen trees along both
    sides of the front road leading up to the house. The first
    trees in the avenue are supposed to be planted at the very
    beginning of the road, and the last trees of the avenue at the
    very end of the road. Tim, who was constantly being reminded of
    her sense of accuracy, knew that the countess would insist on
    the trees being placed in perfectly aligned tree pairs, one on
    each side of the road, and with exactly the same spacing
    between the pairs along the road. However, when bringing the
    tree plants to the estate, Tim had just dropped them
    arbitrarily along the left side of the road and was now facing
    the task of moving the trees to their correct positions to meet
    the countess’s requirements. Being stronger in mind than in
    arms, and since it was time for a coffee break anyway before he
    started digging, he sat down to figure out which trees to move
    to which positions so as to minimize the total (Euclidean)
    distance that he had to move the trees.

    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input file starts with a positive even integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> between <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000$</span> (inclusive), giving the
    total number of trees in the avenue. The next line contains two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le L \le 10\, 000$</span> is the length
    of the road, in meters, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le W \le 20$</span> is the width of the road, in meters. The
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each
    describe where Tim had dropped of the trees. Each such line
    contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le p \le
    L$</span> indicating the position of a tree plant along the
    left side of the road, measured in meters from the start of the
    road.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the smallest total number of meters the tree plants
    need to be moved. The answer should be given with an absolute
    or relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
