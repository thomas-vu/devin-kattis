<p>You and your friends at the Betting against All Probability
    Club are visiting a casino where the following game is
    played.</p>
<p>Each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> players
    starts with <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lives and
    puts in a fixed amount of money. In each round of the game,
    each player flips a biased coin and loses a life if she gets
    tails. The game ends when only one player remains, in which
    case this person wins, or ends in a draw if all remaining
    players lose their last life in the same round. If there is a
    winner, she wins <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> times
    her original bet. In case of a draw, no one wins anything.</p>
<p>Being a BAPC member you quickly realize the casino has an
    edge here: whenever the game ends in a draw all of the
    contestants lose the money they bet. You are now wondering what
    exactly is the probability that this game ends in a draw, so
    you can figure out how much the casino profits on average.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq n\leq 50$</span>, the number of
        players, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq k\leq
        50$</span>, the number of lives each player has, and a real
        number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.1 \leq p \leq
        0.9$</span>, with at most two digits after the decimal
        point, which is the probability the coin lands heads.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Output a single real number: the probability of the game
        ending in a draw. Your answer should have an absolute error
        of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
