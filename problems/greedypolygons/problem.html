<p>People are rarely content with what they have — they
    always seem to want more. Sometimes this is just healthy
    ambition, but at other times it is clearly motivated by shallow
    materialism, or worse. Perhaps we could accept this as an
    unavoidable aspect of human nature, but the problem is that
    this mindset appears to be spreading rapidly to the world of
    mathematics and computer science. For example, greedy
    algorithms are already well known for taking as much as they
    can in each iteration, but now geometric shapes are getting in
    on the act! So far, only regular polygons have been affected,
    but who knows where it will end?</p>
<p>In a regular <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-sided
    polygon (<span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-gon), all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> sides are of equal
    length, and all interior angles are the same. (For our
    purposes, a polygon includes its interior, i.e., it is a solid
    shape.) In the past, the area of a regular <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-gon</span> with a given side
    length was fixed, which was very convenient for students tasked
    with calculating its area, but now, whenever it gets the
    chance, a regular <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-gon</span> will
    carry out an expansion operation informally known as a “land
    grab.” A land grab with expansion distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$d &gt; 0$</span> works as follows: every
    point outside the regular <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-gon</span> that
    is at most distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> from some point in the regular
    <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-gon</span> is absorbed and becomes
    a part of the enlarged <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-gon</span>.
    Over time, a regular <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-gon</span>
    might carry out many land grabs. (Technically, a regular
    <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-gon</span> ceases to be a regular
    <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-gon</span> after the first such
    land grab, but, sadly, it doesn’t notice that its greed is
    causing it to lose its identity.) Figure <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> depicts the two test cases in the
    sample input: a regular <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-gon</span>
    (triangle) after a single land grab, and a regular <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-gon</span> (square) after two land
    grabs.</p>
<p>Given an initial regular <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-gon</span> and
    an expansion distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>,
    what is the area of the resulting region after a specified
    number of land grabs?</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of test cases
    <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 100$</span>)</span>. Each of
    the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contains the information for a single regular <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-gon</span>, given as four
    space-separated integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the initial number of sides
    <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq n \le 60$</span>)</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> is the initial
    side length, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is the
    expansion distance <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq \ell , d \leq
    10$</span>)</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> is the number of land grabs
    <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq g \leq 20$</span>)</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the area of the region occupied
    by the <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-gon</span> after <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> land grabs. Each area will be
    considered correct if it is within <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> of the official answer.</p>
