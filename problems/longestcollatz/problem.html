<div class="problembody">
<p>The Collatz conjecture says that if you take a positive
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and repeat the
    following procedure you always end up at <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. If the number is even you divide
    it by two, and otherwise you multiply by three and add one.
    Dividing by two or multiplying by three and adding one both
    count as one step.</p>
<p>We want to find what number <span class="tex2jax_process">$&lt; n$</span> takes the highest number of
    steps before ending at <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \leq 10^6$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$&lt;
    n$</span> that takes the most steps before reaching one. If
    there are ties, print the smaller number.</p>
