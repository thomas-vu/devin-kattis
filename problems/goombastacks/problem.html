<p>While exploring a cave, Mario finds that the entrance behind
    has been closed, leaving him no escape except going forward.
    Luckily, he has Cappy to help him escape. In front of Mario are
    a series of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> rooms,
    which he must traverse in order. In the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th room, Mario will find
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$g_ i$</span> Goombas, which
    Mario can control using his trusty hat, Cappy. Each room also
    has a button, marked with <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_
    i$</span>, which indicates the number of Goombas needed to
    traverse from the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    room to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+1$</span>-th room.
    Using Cappy, Mario can stack goombas in order to reach the
    threshold of Goombas needed for the button. Additionally, he
    can bring any previous Goombas to subsequent rooms. Mario can
    escape the cave if he escapes the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>-th room. Can you determine if
    Mario can escape?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input is a integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 100\, 000$</span>. The
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    consist <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    space-separated integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$g_
    i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq g_ i \leq 1\,
    000)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq b_ i \leq 100\, 000\,
    000)$</span>, representing the number of goombas in the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th room and the number
    of goombas needed to escape the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th room respectively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If Mario can escape, print “possible”. If Mario cannot
    escape, print “impossible”.</p>
