<p>Ken is a fencer with a big problem: he swings too hard!</p>
<p>Whenever Ken gets a new sword, he’s sure to break it sooner
    rather than later. It’s occurred to him that this habit is
    costing him quite a bit of money, since he normally buys a new
    sword whenever his current sword breaks. However, he’s heard
    from a fellow club member that he could instead make new swords
    out of his old swords!</p>
<p>Each bamboo sword Ken uses has four bamboo ’slats’ which
    help to cushion each blow for the receiving partner. Whenever
    Ken breaks his sword, he breaks either one, two, three, or all
    four slats.</p>
<p>When Ken first tried to put a sword together with the
    remains of two broken swords, he realized that not all slats
    are equivalent. When the slats are bundled together, they
    conform to the shape of the slat which sits opposite!</p>
<p>Ken doesn’t want an uncomfortable grip, so he will put only
    an old slat in a new position if it is of the same or opposite
    type. There are four possible slats “top” (<tt class="ttfamily">T</tt>), “bottom” (<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>),
    “left” (<tt class="ttfamily">L</tt>), and “right” (<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>). When looking at a sword head on, these
    slats form the following configuration:</p>
<center>

</center>
<p>As an example, Ken will only replace a top slat with a top
    or bottom slat.</p>
<p>After collecting broken swords for quite a while, Ken has
    decided to build as many swords as possible. Write a program to
    compute how many swords he will be able to build and how many
    slats he’ll have left over!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. On the first line,
    you are given <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the
    number of swords Ken has broken. On each of the next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, you are given
    four characters. The characters correspond to the following
    slat ordering: <tt class="ttfamily">TBLR</tt>. If the character
    in a position is <tt class="ttfamily">0</tt>, then the slat is
    not broken, and if it is a <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt>, Ken is
    out of luck!</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output three numbers: the total number of swords Ken can
    make, the sum of the numbers of the remaining T and B slats,
    and the sum of the numbers of the remaining L and R slats,
    respectively.</p>
