<p>A common saying goes that if you like sailing, it is much
    better to have a friend with a boat rather than being the
    friend with a boat.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a></p>
<p>Being mathematically inclined, you have realized that this
    property applies recursively – it is much better to be the
    <em>friend of a friend</em> with a boat rather than having a
    boat, and so on.</p>
<p>In a small coastal city, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> people, of which <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> already have boats. Among them,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> pairs of people are
    friends with each other. You start to wonder, what is the
    smallest amount of people who would have to buy a boat so that
    everyone in the city either owns a boat or could borrow one
    from a friend (possibly indirectly through a friend of a friend
    of a …)?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 100\, 000$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le B \le N$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le M \le 200\, 000$</span>),
    as described in the statement.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> integers – the 1-indexed numbers
    of everyone with a boat.</p>
<p>The final <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines
    describe the pairs of friends. Each line contains the numbers
    of two friends <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a \neq b
    \le N$</span>, separated by spaces.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer – the number of additional people
    who must buy a boat.</p>
