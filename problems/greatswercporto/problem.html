<div class="problembody">
<p>We want to have a great SWERC at Porto this year and we
    approached this challenge in several ways. We even framed it as
    a word addition problem, similar to the classic <span class="tex2jax_process">$SEND+MORE=MONEY$</span>, where each letter
    stands for a single digit (0, 1, 2, ..., 8, 9) that makes the
    arithmetic operation correct. In word additions different
    letters cannot be assigned the same digit and the leftmost
    letter in a word cannot be zero (0). In particular, a single
    letter term cannot be zero.</p>

<p>To solve this word addition problem we had to find positive
    digits for G, S and P, and digits for R, E, A, T, W, C, O, so
    that each letter has a different digit and the sum is correct.
    It turns out that, unlike the classical <span class="tex2jax_process">$SEND+MORE=MONEY$</span> which has a single
    solution, <span class="tex2jax_process">$GREAT+SWERC=PORTO$</span> has six
    solutions.</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{align*} T=7,
    E=3, W=9, G=1, A=0, P=4, S=2, C=8, R=6, O=5 \\ T=7, E=3, W=9,
    G=2, A=0, P=4, S=1, C=8, R=6, O=5 \\ T=8, E=5, W=1, G=3, A=7,
    P=9, S=6, C=4, R=0, O=2 \\ T=8, E=5, W=1, G=6, A=7, P=9, S=3,
    C=4, R=0, O=2 \\ T=9, E=5, W=2, G=1, A=8, P=7, S=6, C=4, R=0,
    O=3 \\ T=9, E=5, W=2, G=6, A=8, P=7, S=1, C=4, R=0, O=3 \\
    \end{align*}</span>
<p>Having more than one solution does not make <span class="tex2jax_process">$GREAT+SWERC=PORTO$</span> a good problem to
    solve by hand, but it is still a piece of cake for a programer.
    Moreover, it gives us another reason to organize SWERC again
    next year and, who knows, in years to come!</p>
<h3>Task</h3>
<p>Given a word addition problem, compute the number of
    solutions (possibly zero).</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>A line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines containing a word each with
    maximum length of 10 letters. The first <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> words are the terms to be added
    and the last line is the result. Words contain only capital
    letters. If words have different lengths, they must be
    interpreted as aligning to the right. For instance, in the
    SEND+MORE=MONEY problem, the D of the first word and E of the
    second word align with the Y of the final word. You can also
    assume that the size of the last word is greater than or equal
    to the maximum size of the preceding words, and moreover, at
    most ten distinct letters are involved in a word problem.</p>
<h3>Constraints</h3>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq n \leq 10$</span><br/>
    Each word has at most 10 symbols (capital letters).<br/>
    A word problem has at most 10 distinct letters.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>A single line with an integer: the number of solutions of
    the word addition problem given as input.</p>
