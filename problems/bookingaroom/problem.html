</div>Going to a contest such as NWERC is not all fun and
    games, there are also some worldly matters to tend to. One of
    these is to book hotel rooms in time, before all the rooms in
    town are booked.

    <p>In this problem, you should write a program to search for
    available rooms in a given hotel. The hotel has <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> rooms, numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, and you will be given a list
    describing which of these rooms are already booked.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq r \leq 100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq n \le r$</span>), the number of
        rooms in the hotel and the number of rooms that are already
        booked, respectively;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        with an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (inclusive), a room number
        that is already booked;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> room numbers of
    the already booked rooms are distinct.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If there are available rooms, output the room number of any
    such room. Otherwise, output “<tt class="ttfamily">too
    late</tt>”.</p>
