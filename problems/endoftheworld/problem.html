<p>Legend says that there is a group of monks who are solving a
    large Towers of Hanoi puzzle. The Towers of Hanoi is a
    well-known puzzle, consisting of three pegs, with a stack of
    disks, each a different size. At the start, all of the disks
    are stacked on one of the pegs, and ordered from largest (on
    the bottom) to smallest (on the top). The object is to move
    this stack of disks to another peg, subject to two rules: 1)
    you can only move one disk at a time, and 2) you cannot move a
    disk onto a peg if that peg already has a smaller disk on
    it.</p>
<p>The monks believe that when they finish, the world will end.
    Suppose you know how far they’ve gotten. Assuming that the
    monks are pursuing the most efficient solution, how much time
    does the world have</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There will be up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\,
    048$</span> test cases in the input. Each test case will
    consist of a string of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$63$</span>, on a single line. This string
    will contain only (capital) <b class="bfseries">A</b>s,
    <b class="bfseries">B</b>s and <b class="bfseries">C</b>s. The
    length of the string indicates the number of disks, and each
    character indicates the position of one disk. The first
    character tells the position of the smallest disk, the second
    character tells the position of the second smallest disk, and
    so on, until the last character, which tells the position of
    the largest disk. The character will be <b class="bfseries">A</b>, <b class="bfseries">B</b> or <b class="bfseries">C</b>, indicating which peg the disk is currently
    on. You may assume that the monks’ overall goal is to move the
    disks from peg <b class="bfseries">A</b> to peg <b class="bfseries">B</b>, and that the input represents a legitimate
    position in the optimal solution. The input will end with a
    line with a single capital <b class="bfseries">X</b>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print a single number on its own line
    indicating the number of moves remaining until the given Towers
    of Hanoi problem is solved. Output no extra spaces, and do not
    separate answers with blank lines. All possible inputs yield
    answers which will fit in a signed <span class="tex2jax_process">$64$</span>-bit integer.</p>
