<p>At a recent doctor’s appointment, Brandon has been marked as
    being deficient in magnesium. His doctor has advised him to
    take exactly some number of picograms of magnesium a day. His
    doctor can prescribe pills that have any integer number of
    picograms of magnesium from one up to a maximum. Brandon
    doesn’t like taking pills though, so he refuses any
    prescription that requires him to take too many pills in a
    day.</p>
<p>Your task is to find all prescriptions that Brandon could be
    given. Note that all pills prescribed to Brandon must have the
    same dosage.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The single line of input contains three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n,k,p \le 10^{11}$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of picograms per day
    that Brandon must take, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is the maximum amount in picograms
    of magnesium in any of the pills, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is the maximum number of pills per
    day that Brandon is willing to take.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>On the first line, output a single integer, which is the
    number of prescriptions that Brandon could be given.</p>
<p>On each subsequent line, output a single integer, which is
    the number of picograms per pill in the prescription. Output
    the prescriptions in increasing order.</p>
