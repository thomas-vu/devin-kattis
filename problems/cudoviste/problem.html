<div class="problembody">
<p>Mirko got his driver’s license! To celebrate that joyous
    occasion, his parents bought him his first car: a monster
    truck! Mirko found out that even though having a car that can
    squash all other cars is nice in traffic jams, parking a car
    that is the size of <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>
    normal cars can be a bit tricky.</p>
<p>His friend, Slavko, works part time in the city parking
    company. He periodically sends Mirko a map of the city with
    occupied parking spaces marked. The map can be represented as a
    table with <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rows,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> columns each. Each
    cell can contain a building (symbol ‘<tt class="ttfamily">#</tt>’), a parked car (symbol ‘<tt class="ttfamily">X</tt>’) or a free parking space (symbol ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’). A monster truck is quite huge,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> cells to be exact.</p>
<p>Help Mirko calculate the number of possible parking spaces
    grouped by the number of cars he needs to squash to park in
    them. We are only interested in the number of cars Mirko will
    squash on the parking space, not the number of cars he will
    squash on the way over. However, Mirko can’t park on a
    building. Not even a monster truck is large enough to squash
    buildings!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq R, C \leq 50$</span>), the number of rows and columns of
    the map. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>
    lines contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>
    characters each. Only characters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">#</tt>’,
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">X</tt>’ and ‘<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’
    appear in the input. Note that ‘<tt class="ttfamily">X</tt>’
    will always be capital.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output consists of five lines, the total number of
    parking spaces Mirko can park on if he squashes <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> cars (first line), <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> car (second line), <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> cars (third line), <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> cars (fourth line), <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> cars (fifth line).</p>
