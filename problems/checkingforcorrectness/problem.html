<p>In mathematics, it’s always important to check your work.
    Usually, this means making some sort of quick calculation
    (either in your head, or on paper) to ensure that the answers
    you find make sense.</p>
<p>Your colleague has written an implementation of a general
    arithmetic system which supports arbitrarily large numbers and
    operations like addition, multiplication, exponentiation. She
    has asked you to write an independent program that checks that
    the answers her software gives make sense (though they may not
    be perfectly correct!).</p>
<p>Write a program that checks the correctness of simple
    arithmetic statements of the form:</p>
<pre>
    a + b
    a * b
    a ^ b
</pre>
<p>That is, addition, multiplication, and exponentiation. The
    output of your program is the value of the smallest-order
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> digits of the
    answer. Then your colleague can check whether her software gave
    the same digits for that portion. If not, you know there’s a
    problem!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a sequence of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$30\, 000$</span> arithmetic expressions, one
    per line, in the format given above. All tokens are separated
    by single spaces. All numbers are integers in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0, 2^{32})$</span>. Input ends
    at the end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each expression, print the last <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> digits of the answer,
    omitting any leading zeros.</p>
