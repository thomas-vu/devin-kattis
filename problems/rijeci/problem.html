<p>One day, little Mirko came across a funny looking machine!
    It consisted of a <em>very very large</em> screen and a single
    button. When he found the machine, the screen displayed only
    the letter A. After he pressed the button, the letter changed
    to B. The next few times he pressed the button, the word
    transformed from B to BA, then to BAB, then to BABBA... When he
    saw this, Mirko realized that the machine alters the word in a
    way that all the letters B get transformed to BA and all the
    letters A get transformed to B.</p>
<p>Amused by the machine, Mirko asked you a very difficult
    question! After <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> times
    of pressing the button, how many letters A and how much letters
    B will be displayed on the screen?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq K \leq 45$</span>), the number of times Mirko pressed the
    button.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain two
    space-separated integers, the number of letters A and the
    number of letter B.</p>
