<p>After a long summerâ€™s march through the rough terrain of
    northern America, the indian tribe had found a place where they
    hopefully would be left alone. The chief proclaimed that this
    would be the new place for their village, despite the rocky
    nature of the landscape. They set a temporary camp for the
    night, content with the piece of land they had discovered. The
    very next day however, it stood clear that some effort planning
    the locations of the Teepee tents had to be made. It was simply
    too great a difference in altitude between the tents, making
    the walk along some paths extremely tiresome. Therefore, the
    chief ordered his witty son, Fast Thought, to find a connected
    area in their vicinity, large enough to host all tents of the
    tribe, having as small difference between the highest and
    lowest point as possible.</p>
<p>The task called for some altitude measurements of their
    whereabouts, which caused no problem for Fast Thought, since he
    was wise in the ways of trigonometry. He divided the land into
    squares big enough to host a tent each and estimated the
    altitude of each square. Now the problem was reduced to finding
    a connected region containing at least as many squares as there
    were tents, having the smallest difference between the highest
    and lowest altitude. He drew a rectangular matrix <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, representing the area, where the
    entry <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i,j}$</span> at row
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and column
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, was the altitude of
    the square with coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i,
    j)$</span>. He considered an entry <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i,j}$</span> adjacent to the entries
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i,j +1}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i +1,j}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i,j-1}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i-1,j}$</span>, and called a set of
    entries <em>connected</em> if for every pair of entries in the
    set, there was a connecting path of adjacent entries in it.
    Since the size of the tribe altered with time, Fast Thought
    decided to solve the problem for a general number of tents.
    Thus the problem left to solve for him was to find a set of at
    least <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> connected
    entries <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i,j}$</span> in the
    matrix <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, such that the
    difference between the largest and the smallest entry in the
    set was minimized.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line of input there are two positive integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r, c \le 50$</span>, giving the
    dimensions of the matrix <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines, each containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> integers between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$99$</span>, are the entries <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i,j}$</span> of the matrix. The next line
    contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \le
    100$</span>, and is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each holding a single
    positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_ i \le r
    \cdot c$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_ i$</span> ,
    output one line containing the minimum difference between the
    largest and the smallest entry for any connected set of at
    least <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_ i$</span> entries.</p>
