<div class="problembody">
<p>As a city planner, you have spent a lot of time building a
    set of two-way roads so that people can get from anywhere in
    the city to anywhere else just by driving on the roads. Now
    that that’s done, you are concerned with how much time
    commuters spend on the road each day, and how you can reduce
    this. You have modeled the city as a set of intersections
    connected by roads. You have come up with a measure of the
    total commute time: it is the sum of the shortest driving time
    between all pairs of intersections in the city using the
    available roads. You have gotten the city to agree to build one
    more road between two existing intersections, and you want to
    add a single road that will reduce this measure of commute time
    the most. Which road should you add?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> test cases. Each test case
    begins with a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le n \le 100$</span>, which is the number of intersections.
    Intersections are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines describe the unique
    locations of the intersections, given in order from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. Each location is an
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x~ y$</span> integer coordinate
    pair, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$-500 \le x, y \le
    500$</span>. The following line contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le m \le n(n-1)/2$</span>
    indicating the number of roads that currently exist, followed
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines describing
    the roads. Each road is described as a pair of intersection
    numbers. Within a test case each road is unique. The commute
    time for a road is the number of seconds it takes to travel
    between the road’s endpoints at constant speed of one unit per
    second. It is guaranteed that all intersections are connected
    by some sequence of roads. Input ends when <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each city configuration, print out which pair of
    intersections should be connected by a road to minimize the
    total commute time measure, and give the new commute time
    measure. If the solution is not unique, then give the solution
    that uses the lowest-numbered intersections (with preference
    that the first intersection is the lowest number possible,
    followed by the preference that the second intersection is the
    lowest number possible). If no road addition will improve
    things, indicate that instead. Your answers should have a
    relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.0001$</span>.</p>
