<div class="problembody">
<p>Yan and Fen have just accepted jobs in TechValley California
    allowing them to pursue their childhood dream of renting the
    most expensive apartment in the area.</p>
<p>Yan and Fen have decided that the rent of an apartment
    denoted <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> is a function
    of its square footage <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
    and the number of smartbulbs <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> it has. The cost of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> square foot is given by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and the cost of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> smartbulb is given by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and thus we
    have,</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{equation*} R = ax
    + by \end{equation*}</span>
<p>Fortunately for the pair, TechValley California has no
    shortage of expensive apartments for rent. Unfortunately, there
    are some specific constraints on the apartment and the contents
    of the apartment that Yan and Fen must follow. First the square
    footage of the apartment and the number of smart bulbs must
    both be greater than or equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{align*} x &amp; \geq 1\\ y &amp; \geq
    1 \end{align*}</span>
<p>Secondly, the square footage of the apartment plus the
    number of smartbulbs cannot exceed a specific <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, you may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> will always be an even
    integer.</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{equation*} x +
    y \leq m \end{equation*}</span>
<p>Lastly, since both Yan and Fen need lots of outlets in their
    apartment to support all their electronics they will only look
    at apartments that have exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> outlets for each square foot of
    the house in addition to one outlet for each smartbulb with
    minimum of <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sigma $</span>
    outlets. You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sigma $</span> will always be an even
    integer.</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{equation*} 2x
    + y \geq \sigma \end{equation*}</span>
<p>Find the maximum rent of an apartment <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> subject to these constraints</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case with two lines. The
    test case starts with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq a, b &lt; 100$</span>), the price per square foot and
    price per smart bulb respectively. The next line consists of
    two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sigma $</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; m, \sigma \leq 10^8$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m, \sigma $</span> are both
    even) the square footage and smartbulbs maximum and the minimum
    number of outlets respectively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line with the maximum value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>. Note that <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> is guaranteed to be an integer and
    the input will be supplied such that there will always be a
    solution.</p>
