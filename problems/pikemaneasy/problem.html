</div>Programming is an ancient art. Archeologists have made
    findings which indicate that already in the Middle Ages,
    infantry were practicing for programming contests while not in
    battle. Although it is not known how the programming contests
    were carried out (there were no computers), the archeologists
    have come up with a good theory (according to them). It states
    that infantry submitted pseudocode carved into stone, and then
    by the end of the contest, a genius priest named Kátisse ran
    all the programs in her head for correction. How they know her
    name? They won’t say.

    <p>One of the reasons for this somewhat peculiar theory was the
    finding of ancient pike, a combat spear. Scientists have found
    many of these throughout the years. They come with a special
    symbol carved into them, usually the symbol of the tribe. This
    one didn’t have a symbol carved into it, it had pseudo code for
    Fenwick trees, as well as a config file for some kind of
    editor. Scientists are unsure which editor it might have been,
    but they believe it was some version of the closed Emacs
    beta.</p>
<p>Instead of looking for more evidence, the archeologists
    started speculating what strategy the pikemen used in these
    programming contests. They must have been well prepared, since
    this guy had algorithms carved into his spear. The contest
    rules were probably as follows: When submiting a solution to
    the judge, the time in minutes from contest start was added to
    a penalty counter. So in order to plan his problem solving, a
    pikeman must have been good at approximating the number of
    minutes required to solve each problem.</p>
<p>You are given a number of problems which were designed for a
    contest in which the pikeman participated. For each problem,
    you are given the estimated time in minutes for solving the
    problem. Calculate the maximum number of problems a pikeman can
    solve in the contest, and the minimum penalty he can get, under
    the assumptions that these estimations are correct. You may
    assume that the pikemen are very efficient: submissions are
    always correct, and after submitting a problem they start
    solving the next problem immediately.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with two integers on a single line <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 10^4$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le T \le 10^{9}$</span>, the number of
    problems in the ancient contest and the total length of the
    contest in minutes. Then follows a line with four integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le A, B, C, t_0 \le
    10^6$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_0$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$(t_0\leq C)$</span> specifies
    the time in minutes required for solving the first problem, and
    the rest of the times <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1, \dots
    , t_{N-1}$</span> are given by:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{equation*} t_ i = ((At_{i-1}+B) \text
    {mod } C) + 1, i \in [1,N-1] \end{equation*}</span>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output should consist of two integers: the maximum number of
    problems a pikeman can solve within the time limit, and the
    total penalty he will get for solving them. As the penalty
    might be huge, print it modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 007$</span>. Print them on
    the same line, separated by a single space.</p>
