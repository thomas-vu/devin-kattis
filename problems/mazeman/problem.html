<div class="problembody">
<p>You now work for a video game company - every programmer’s
    dream! You are working on a multiplayer game where players
    cooperate to enter a maze and try to consume all of the “dots”
    as quickly as possible. Each player enters the maze at a
    different entrance. The mazes are randomly generated, so the
    minimum number of players needed to consume all of the dots can
    vary, and some dots may not be reachable at all.</p>
<p>You are working in the Quality Control department, analyzing
    the randomly generated mazes. For analysis, the mazes are
    represented in text. An <tt class="tt">X</tt> is a wall that
    cannot be crossed. Letters <tt class="tt">A</tt>-<tt class="tt">W</tt> are entrances. Players can only move up, down, left
    and right. Players can move though spaces and dots; moving over
    a dot eats it. If two doors are adjacent, players cannot move
    from one to the other. For example:</p>
<center>
<tt class="ttfamily">XXXXXXXAXXXXXXXBXXXX<br/>
      X.. ..X.X...... ...X<br/>
      X.XXX...X.X.XXXXXX.X<br/>
      X.X.XXXXX.X.X....X.X<br/>
      X.X... ...X.X.XX.X.X<br/>
      X.X.X.XXXXXXX.XX.X.X<br/>
      X.X.X.X...X...X....X<br/>
      X.X.X.XXXXXXX.XXXX.X<br/>
      X...X.X X.. ..X..X.X<br/>
      XXXXXXXDXXXXXXXXCXXX<br/></tt>
</center>
<p>All of the reachable dots can be reached from entrances
    <tt class="tt">A</tt> and <tt class="tt">C</tt> (or,
    equivalently, <tt class="tt">B</tt> and <tt class="tt">C</tt>).
    There are three dots that cannot be reached.</p>
<p>Calculate the minimum number of players necessary to eat all
    the reachable dots, and how many dots are not reachable because
    they are walled off.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>This first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \le n,m \le 100$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of rows in the maze
    representation, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is
    the number of columns.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains a string of length exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, consisting only of the capital
    letters <tt class="tt">A</tt> through <tt class="tt">X</tt>,
    space, or period. This is the maze. The borders of the maze
    (rows <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, columns <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>) are guaranteed to consist only of
    capital letters <tt class="tt">A</tt> through <tt class="tt">X</tt>. There are no entrances (<tt class="tt">A</tt>-<tt class="tt">W</tt>) in the middle of the
    maze.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a line with two space-separated integers, the first
    of which is the minimum number of entrances necessary to enter
    in order to eat all of the dots (which may be <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> if no dots are reachable), and the
    second of which is the number of dots which cannot be
    reached.</p>
