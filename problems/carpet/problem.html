<p>The Algebraist Carpet Manufacturing (ACM) group likes to
    produce area carpets based upon various geometric figures. The
    2014 ACM carpets are all equilateral triangles. Unfortunately,
    due to a manufacturing defect, some of the carpets are not as
    stain-resistant as intended. The ACM group is offering to
    replace each defective carpet that contains a stain.</p>

<p>The web form used to report the stained carpet requests the
    three distances that the stain is away from the corners of the
    rug. Based upon these three numbers, you need to compute the
    area of the rug that is to be sent to the customer, or indicate
    that the customer’s carpet doesn’t come from ACM.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that
    your program may be run multiple times on different inputs.
    Each test case will consist of a single line with three
    floating point numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; a,b,c \le 100$</span>, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> digits after the decimal point)
    representing the distances from the stain to each of the three
    corners of the carpet. There will be a single space between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, and between <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line with a single floating point number. If
    there is a carpet that satisfies the constraints, output the
    area of this carpet. If not, output <tt class="ttfamily">-1</tt>. The output should have an absolute error of
    at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span>.</p>
