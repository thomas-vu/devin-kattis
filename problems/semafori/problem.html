<div class="problembody">
<p>Luka is driving his truck along a long straight road with
    many traffic lights. For each traffic light he knows how long
    the red and green lights will be on (the cycle repeating
    endlessly).</p>
<p>When Luka starts his journey, all traffic lights are red and
    just started their cycle. Luka moves one distance unit per
    second. When a traffic light is red, he stops and waits until
    it turns green.</p>
<p>Write a program that determines how much time Luka needs to
    reach the end of the road. The start of the road is at distance
    zero, the end at distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le L
    \le 1000$</span>), the number of traffic lights on the road and
    the length of the road.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span>, describing one traffic light
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le D &lt; L$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le R \le 100$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le G \le 100$</span>).
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> is the distance of the
    traffic light from the start of the road. <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> denote how long the red and green
    lights are on, respectively.</p>
<p>The traffic lights will be ordered in increasing order of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>. No two traffic lights
    will share the same position.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the time (in seconds) Luka needs to reach the end of
    the road.</p>
