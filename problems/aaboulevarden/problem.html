<p>Your study group is planning a pub crawl in the bars along
    one side of the Aarhus River.</p>
<p>All the bars are nice and inviting, but each serves only one
    kind of beer. The members of your group have different,
    varying, and even conflicting preferences in beverages, so you
    switch bars often.</p>
<p>You have a map of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> bars located along the river, and
    want to construct a navigation system for the night out. The
    portion of the river along which bars are located crosses
    through the inner part of town in a relatively straight
    fashion, and every bar takes up about the same amount of space,
    so you model the positions of the bars as evenly spaced points
    on a straight line.</p>
<p>When the system is finished, it should take as input your
    group’s current location (i.e., the current bar) and the name
    of a beer, and return directions to a nearest bar serving that
    beer. This way, you will have a foolproof way to continue the
    crawl even when your natural navigation skills inevitably fall
    short.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 150\, 000$</span>, the number
    of bars along the river. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, one for each bar. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th line contains the
    name of the beer served at the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th bar. Each beer name consists of
    upper- or lowercase letters from the English alphabet, digits,
    and/or hyphens.</p>
<p>The next line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq Q \leq 50\, 000$</span>, the number
    of navigation queries. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> navigation queries, each on a
    separate line. Each query consists on an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq X &lt; N$</span>,
    specifying a bar, and a beer name <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>. There is at least one bar serving
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>. (This may be include
    bar <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>.)</p>
<p>You can assume that the input file is no larger than 10
    MiB.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each navigation query <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, output a line with an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> representing the
    navigation result.</p>
<p>There should be a bar at location <span class="tex2jax_process">$X + D$</span> serving beer <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>. Additionally, among such valid
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>, you should output a
    result that requires you to pass the fewest number of bars
    (i.e., the absolute value <span class="tex2jax_process">$|D|$</span> should be minimised). If there
    are still multiple options any one will be accepted.</p>
