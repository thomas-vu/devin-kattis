<div class="problembody">
<p>Brandon Greg Jr. told you that he found an interesting
    undirected graph <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span>. The
    graph has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> vertices
    labelled with the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2,
    \ldots , n$</span>. The graph is simple, meaning that each edge
    is between two distinct vertices, and no two edges are between
    the same pair of vertices.</p>
<p>Since Brandon doesn’t talk very much, you’ll have to play
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\, 000$</span> questions and
    solve this interactive problem to guess the graph. For each
    question, you may give him a subset <span class="tex2jax_process">$S\subset V(G)$</span> of the vertices.
    Brandon (the judge) would then tell you the number of edges
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$V(G)\setminus S$</span>.</p>
<p>Can you guess the graph in at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\, 000$</span> queries?</p>
<h2>Interaction</h2>
<p>The judge will start by outputting a single line containing
    a single number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2\le n\le 50$</span>), the
    number of vertices in the graph.</p>
<p>For each query, you may output one of the following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">?</tt> <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_1$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_2$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\dots $</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_ k$</span> – If you output a question
        mark followed by an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le k\le n$</span>) and the indices of
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> vertices, the
        judge will reply with the number of edges in the cut
        between <span class="tex2jax_process">$S = \{ v_1, v_2,
        \dots , v_ k\} $</span> and the remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-k$</span> vertices in <span class="tex2jax_process">$V(G)\setminus S$</span>. If your input
        is malformed, the judge will output <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>. If you receive a reply of
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>, please terminate
        your program immediately, or you may get an unexpected
        verdict.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><tt class="ttfamily">!</tt> – After outputting an
        exclamation mark, you must output the adjacency matrix of
        the graph on <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        lines, each containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> numbers. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th number on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line should be <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> if there is an edge between
        vertices <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> otherwise. Your program must
        terminate immediately after outputting this matrix.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You may output no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\, 000$</span> queries beginning with
    <tt class="ttfamily">?</tt>. Remember to flush your output
    after each query. The sample input and output only serve to
    show how one should interact with the judge, and the empty
    lines are for easier reading.</p>
