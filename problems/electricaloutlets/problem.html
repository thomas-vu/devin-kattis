</div>Roy has just moved into a new apartment. Well, actually
    the apartment itself is not very new, even dating back to the
    days before people had electricity in their houses. Because of
    this, Royâ€™s apartment has only one single wall outlet, so Roy
    can only power one of his electrical appliances at a time.
    <p>Roy likes to watch TV as he works on his computer, and to
    listen to his HiFi system (on high volume) while he vacuums, so
    using just the single outlet is not an option. Actually, he
    wants to have all his appliances connected to a powered outlet,
    all the time. The answer, of course, is power strips, and Roy
    has some old ones that he used in his old apartment. However,
    that apartment had many more wall outlets, so he is not sure
    whether his power strips will provide him with enough outlets
    now.</p>
<p>Your task is to help Roy compute how many appliances he can
    provide with electricity, given a set of power strips. Note
    that without any power strips, Roy can power one single
    appliance through the wall outlet. Also, remember that a power
    strip has to be powered itself to be of any use.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input vill start with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 20$</span>, indicating the
    number of test cases to follow. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, each describing a test
    case. Each test case starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq K \leq 10$</span>, indicating the
    number of power strips in the test case. Then follow, on the
    same line, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> integers
    separated by single spaces, <span class="tex2jax_process">$O_1$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$O_2 \ldots O_ K$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq O_ i \leq 10$</span>, indicating the
    number of outlets in each power strip.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line per test case, with the maximum number of
    appliances that can be powered.</p>
