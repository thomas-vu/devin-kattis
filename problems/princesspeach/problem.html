<p>Mario is trying to save his beloved Princess Peach! However,
    in order to do that, Mario must jump over many obstacles in
    order to save Princess Peach. Thus, he makes a grand plan to
    infiltrate Bowser’s castle.</p>
<p>But first, he needs to practice. His brother Luigi makes a
    practice course for Mario to train on. On this course, Mario
    practices looking for all the possible obstacles that could
    take away his life. But Mario is sloppy and misses some
    obstacles, counts some obstacles more than once, and generally
    screws up the order of the obstacles he does find when he lists
    them!</p>
<p>Write a program so that Luigi can tell his brother which
    obstacles he’s missed!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> values. The first value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; N \le 100$</span>) is the total
    number of obstacles. Obstacles are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \ldots N-1$</span>. The second value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le Y \le 200$</span>) represents how many
    obstacles Mario said he’s found on his practice run. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> lines each list a
    single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le k &lt; N$</span>) which
    is the number of an obstacle Mario says he’s found.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>First, output the obstacles that Mario missed in increasing
    order, each on a separate line. On the last line, print
    <tt class="ttfamily">Mario got X of the dangerous
    obstacles.</tt> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>
    is the number of distinct obstacles Mario found.</p>
