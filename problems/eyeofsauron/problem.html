<p>Little Elrond is obsessed with the Lord of the Rings series.
    Between lectures he likes to doodle the central tower of the
    great fortress Barad-dûr in the margins of his notebook.
    Afterward, he always double checks his drawings to ensure they
    are accurate: with the Eye of Sauron located in the very center
    of the tower. If any are incorrect, he makes sure to fix
    them.</p>
<p>You are to write a program that reads a representation of
    his tower, and ensures that the drawing is correct, with a
    properly centered eye.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single string of length <span class="tex2jax_process">${n}$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$4\leq n \leq 100$</span>. Input strings will
    consist only of three types of characters: vertical bars, open
    parentheses, and closing parentheses. Input strings contain one
    or more vertical bars followed by a set of matching parentheses
    (the “eye”), followed by one or more vertical bars. For a
    drawing to be “correct”, the number of vertical bars on either
    side of the “eye” must match. Input will always contain a pair
    of correctly matched parentheses, with no characters between
    them. No other characters will appear in the string.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>On a single line print the word “correct” if the drawing is
    accurate or the word “fix” if there is an error that needs
    addressing.</p>
