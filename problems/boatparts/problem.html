<p>Boating season is over for this year, and Theseus has parked
    his boat on land. Of course, the boat looks nothing like it did
    as of the beginning of the season; it never does. You see,
    Theseus is constantly looking for ways to improve his boat.</p>
<p>At every day of the boating season, Theseus bought exactly
    one type of item at his local supply store, and replaced the
    existing part on his boat with it. Now, as the season has
    ended, Theseus wonders what day he replaced all the parts from
    the previous season.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of two space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, representing the
    number of parts the boat consists of, and the number of days in
    the boating season respectively.<br/>
    Then follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines,
    each line has a single word <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_
    i$</span>, the type of boat part that Theseus bought on day
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the day Theseus ended up replacing the last existing
    part from the previous season, or <tt class="ttfamily">paradox
    avoided</tt> if Theseus never ended up replacing all the
    different parts.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq P \leq N \leq 1\,
        000$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each word <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_ i$</span>
        will consist only of the letters aâ€“z and <tt class="ttfamily">_</tt> (underscore).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each word <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_ i$</span>
        will be between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> characters
        long.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of distinct <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_
        i$</span>s will be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>.</p>
