<div class="problembody">
<p>You maintain a very nice collection of magical runes. They
    generally come in two types, type <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>
    and type <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>.</p>
<p>You have arranged your runes on a shelf to show them off.
    Because they are magical runes, they change each day. That is,
    at the start of each day the leftmost rune will switch its type
    (i.e. from <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt> to <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt> or from <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt> to
    <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>, depending on its type just before
    the start of the day). Every other rune will only change if the
    type of the rune to its left changes from <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt> to <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>.</p>
<p>For example, if you have three runes initially arranged like
    <tt class="ttfamily">ABBAA</tt>, then at the start of the next
    day only the leftmost rune will change and the sequence will
    look like <tt class="ttfamily">BBBAA</tt>. After another day,
    the leftmost rune will change, but then the second rune from
    the left will change because the rune beside it changed from
    <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt> to <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>. But
    then the third rune will also change for the same reason. And
    then the fourth rune will also change! That is, after the
    changes at the start of this day the runes will look like
    <tt class="ttfamily">AAABA</tt>.</p>
<p>Your task is the following. Given the initial states
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> of an initial
    arrangement of runes and given a number of days <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>, you should determine the states
    of the runes after <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>
    days have elapsed.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single line that first begins with a
    string <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> followed by an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>. The length of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> will be between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> (inclusive) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> will consist only of characters
    <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>.
    The value <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> satisfies
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq D &lt;
    2^{30}$</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, you are also guaranteed that the rightmost rune
    does not change from <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt> to <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt> at the start of any of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> days that you are to consider.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display a single string showing the states of the runes
    after <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> days have
    elapsed, given they started in state <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>.</p>
