<p>Johanna knows mind reading magic, or so she says. Her new
    trick consists of lining up <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> decks of cards, each deck having
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> cards numbered from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>. She asks you to think of a number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \cdot K$</span> and to focus your thoughts
    on it. Then, by scanning the energy profiles emitted from your
    brain activity, she carefully picks one card from each of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> decks. Magically, the
    sum of the numbers on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> picked cards is exactly the number
    that you were thinking of! After staring at her in disbelief
    for quite a while, you suspect it might be a trick she pulls on
    many people, and that she just picks the cards at random and
    happened to get it right with you just by chance.</p>
<p>You start wondering just how large that chance was. You
    could easily compute the number of ways to pick one card from
    each deck, but how many of these ways have the correct sum?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains three space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 100$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le K \le 50$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le T \le N \cdot K$</span> –
    the number of decks, the number of cards in each deck, and the
    number you were thinking of, respectively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer – the number of ways Johanna could
    have picked a card from each deck, such that the picked cards
    sum up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>. Since this
    number can be very large, output it modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 009$</span>.</p>
