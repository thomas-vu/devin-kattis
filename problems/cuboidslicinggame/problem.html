<p>Ruben and Albert are what you can call abnormally smart.
    They are also both very fond of mathematically inspired games.
    Their only problem is that most games are too easy for them,
    and they end up beating everyone who dares challenge them.
    Because of that, they’re now mostly playing against each other.
    To make things interesting, they had a professor design a new
    game for them.</p>
<p>This new game was interesting at first. Nowadays, however,
    Albert often complains that it is impossible for him to win a
    particular round. After long discussions, they’ve now decided
    to take this a step further, and actually figure out who’d win
    if they both played optimally. They need you to write a
    computer program that does this for them.</p>
<p>A state in the game consists of one or more <span class="tex2jax_process">$x\times y\times z$</span> cuboids. A (legal)
    move is choosing a cuboid, then a value for each of the three
    axes (basically choosing three planes), and then cutting the
    cuboid along these (thus removing a <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\times y\times z$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x\times 1\times z$</span> and a <span class="tex2jax_process">$x\times y\times 1$</span>, all overlapping,
    cuboid). In effect you’ve created between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> (inclusive) smaller cuboids. All
    three planes cut from the cuboid need to be on the cuboid (you
    can’t cut away a hypothetical cuboid on the outside of the real
    one).</p>
<p>An example might be in order. You’ve chosen a <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\times 5\times 4$</span> cuboid, and are
    about to cut it. You now need to choose the three planes. This
    means you need an <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, a <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> and a <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span> between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>. Say you choose <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, respectively. The first cut would
    alone cut the cuboid into two <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\times 5\times 4$</span> cuboids, the
    second into a single <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\times
    4\times 4$</span> cuboid, while the third would alone cut the
    cuboid into a <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\times 5\times
    1$</span> and a <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\times 5\times
    2$</span> cuboid. Put together these cuts produces <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> new smaller cuboids, of sizes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\times 4\times
    1$</span>,<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\times 4\times
    1$</span>,<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\times 4\times
    2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\times 4\times
    2$</span>. Note that cutting a cuboid with an axis of size
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> would remove it
    altogether.</p>
<p>The players take turns making a move. The winner is the
    player that removes the last cuboid.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input is a line containing either
    <tt class="ttfamily">RUBEN</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">ALBERT</tt>, the name of the player who starts that
    particular round.<br/>
    Then follows a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of cuboids that
    particular game starts with.<br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines follow, each
    describing a cuboid. A cuboid description consists of three
    numbers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span>, the size of that particular
    cuboid.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the name of the player that wins the game (either
    <tt class="ttfamily">RUBEN</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">ALBERT</tt>).</p>
