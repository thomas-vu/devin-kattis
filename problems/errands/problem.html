<p>You know how it is. At the end of the workday you have a lot
    of errands to run. You have to drive from place to place
    picking up this or dropping off that and it may take you quite
    a while to get home. Naturally, you want to get these errands
    done as quickly as possible, so you want to minimize your
    driving time going from place to place. Your problem is
    simplified by the fact that you live in a vast, sparsely
    populated, featureless wasteland. If you need to drive from the
    pharmacy to the kwik-ee burger (or any two locations), you can
    drive at a constant speed in a straight line between them.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a description of points of interest in
    your town. This description starts with the number of locations
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le n \le 100$</span>. This is
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines,
    each giving the name and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x,
    y$</span> coordinates of some location. Location names are
    strings of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>
    lowercase alphabetic (a–z) or hyphen (-) characters and the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates are real numbers in
    the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-100, 100]$</span>
    with at most five digits past the decimal point. No two
    different locations have the same name. Both “home” and “work”
    are part of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    locations.</p>
<p>The town description is followed by up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> lines, each containing a
    space-separated list of the names of the one to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> unique places you have to visit
    on your way home on a particular day, not including home or
    work. Input terminates at the end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each day, report on a single line the best order to
    visit the locations requested. Here, best is defined as the
    order that minimizes your driving time without repeating any
    stop. If there are multiple equivalent best orders, choose any
    one of them. Your trip always starts at the location named
    “work” and ends at “home”.</p>
