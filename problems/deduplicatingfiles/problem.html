<p>Computer filesystems are often filled with multiple copies
    of identical files. These identical files take up unnecessary
    space, since one copy, plus appropriate file system links, are
    sufficient to represent all the copies. A simple way to combat
    this problem is to compare all pairs of files, removing all
    duplicates.</p>
<p>Comparing all pairs of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> files requires <span class="tex2jax_process">$n(n-1)/2$</span> comparisons, which can be
    quite large, since <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> may
    be very large. Compounding the problem is the fact that
    comparing two files is slow, especially if they are large and
    mostly the same.</p>
<p>One way to reduce this cost is to convert each file to a
    short string (called a hash) using a deterministic hash
    function, and then compare these hashes (instead of whole
    files) to identify potential matches. If two hashes don’t
    match, neither do their corresponding files. If two hashes do
    match, it may be because their corresponding files are
    identical, or because there is a hash collision (two different
    files that produce the same hash). The most straightforward way
    to determine this is to compare the files directly.</p>
<p>For this problem, write a program which determines file
    duplicates using hashing (to identify potential duplicates and
    eliminate impossible ones). The hash function is simple, taking
    as input the entire file, and producing as output one byte. The
    output is the exclusive or (XOR) of the ASCII value of every
    byte in the input.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$250$</span> test cases. Each test case
    begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n
    \leq 500$</span> indicating the number of files. This is
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines,
    each representing one file. Each line has <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> characters, using only the
    characters a–z, A–Z, space, and period (.). Input ends when
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = 0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print the number of unique files and the
    number of hash collisions between all pairs of files.</p>
