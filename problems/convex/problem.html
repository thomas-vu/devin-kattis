<div class="problembody">
<p>You are the boss of <span class="scshape">ACM</span>
    (Association for Convex Main Office), an upstanding company
    with a single goal of world domination.</p>
<p>Today, you have decided to move your main office from
    Helsinki to Singapore. You have purchased a square-shaped land
    in Singapore, represented as a square on a two dimensional
    Cartesian plane. The size of your land is <span class="tex2jax_process">$(4 \cdot 10^7) \times (4 \cdot
    10^7)$</span>.</p>
<p>After much deliberation, your engineers have devised the
    optimal shape of your new main office. It will be a grand
    building, shaped as a convex polygon on the two dimensional
    grid (a convex polygon is a simple polygon such that for any
    two of its vertices, the straight line connecting the two
    vertices is completely inside the polygon). More specifically,
    your main office is represented by a polygon with at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> vertices such
    that:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Each vertex is located on a lattice point (lattice
        points are points which coordinates are integers).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The coordinates of all vertices are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4 \cdot 10^7$</span>, inclusively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All vertices are located on distinct points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No three vertices are collinear (that is, no three
        vertices should be on a line).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All the vertices form a convex polygon in some
        order.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is a known fact that the number of vertices composing
    your main office is very important. A lucky number would
    positively influence the chance of success for all of your evil
    missions. Thus, given <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>,
    the number of vertices of the main office, can you generate any
    one possible way to construct your main office? That is, you
    should output any possible set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> locations of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> vertices of your main office that
    has the properties described earlier.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a non-negative integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq N \leq 400\, 000$</span>, giving the
    number of vertices your main office should have.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines. Each line consists of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x, y \le 4 \cdot 10^7$</span>,
    denoting the coordinates of a vertex making up your main
    office. The coordinates can be given in any order and must
    adhere to your main office’s restrictions as described in the
    problem statement.</p>
<p>Warning: Your program will have to write lots of output.
    Please use fast output routine to minimize the risk of getting
    a ‘Time Limit Exceeded’ verdict.</p>
