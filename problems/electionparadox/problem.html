<p>In Oddland, the leader of the country is determined by a
    democratic election. The country is divided into an odd number
    of regions, in which each region has an odd number of
    voters.</p>
<p>There are two (an even number!) political parties in
    Oddland, and the winning party is the one that wins the most
    number of regions. A party wins a region if it receives more
    votes than the other party in that region.</p>
<p>Under this system, it is possible that the losing party
    receives more votes than the winning party. For example, if
    there are three regions with <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> people, respectively, then a party
    could receive <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> votes and lose the election. In
    this case, the losing party received the majority of the votes
    in the total population.</p>
<p>Determine the largest number of votes a party can receive
    and still lose the election.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an odd integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \leq N \leq 999$</span>), which is the number of regions in
    Oddland.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> odd integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p_ i \leq 999$</span>), which are the
    populations of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    cities.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the largest number of votes a party can receive and
    still lose the election.</p>
