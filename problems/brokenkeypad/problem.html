<div class="problembody">
<p>Astronauts are trained for all kinds of contingencies before
    launch day, and have a unique identifier number for every
    problem they could possibly come up with. As soon as they
    identify the problem, they plug the identifier into a keypad to
    send the information to their crew-mates and to mission control
    back on Earth.</p>
<p>A few days after the big launch, however, the “<span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>” key got stuck! The protocol for
    this scenario is to re-assign any identifier containing a
    “<span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>” to a different
    number. The astronauts are wondering how much work this will
    take, so as the chief coder for the mission you should write a
    program which counts how many identifiers in a given range of
    integers contain the digit “<span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>” and must be re-assigned.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of two space-separate integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a \leq b \leq 77^7 &lt; 2 \cdot
    10^{13}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of integers in the inclusive range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[a, b]$</span> which contain the
    digit <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>.</p>
