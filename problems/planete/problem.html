<p>The European Space Agency has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> telescopes observing distant
    planets. They have classified <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> different types of events. They
    noticed that every day on each planet there is <b class="bfseries">exactly one</b> type of event. They measure events
    in days because they discovered each event lasts at least one
    day, and at most 365 days. Events last only complete numbers of
    days, they never last a fractional part of a day. Each event of
    the same type lasts exactly the same number of days every time
    it occurs, <b class="bfseries">regardless of the planet it
    occurs on</b>.</p>
<p>After many years of observation they want to analyze data.
    The telescopes logged all observations, but unfortunately they
    forgot to write down the year the observations took place! Each
    telescope entry consists of start date, end date and the number
    of events observed of each type. Given all observations on all
    the planets, calculate the duration of each type of event. Note
    that the telescopes are super precise and start working exactly
    when the event starts and end when an event ends, not
    necessarily the same one.</p>
<p><b class="bfseries">Note: for this task, each year has
    exactly 365 days.</b></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N, M \le 200$</span>) - the number of telescopes and the
    number of event types. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$M + 4$</span> numbers each:</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$D_1\text{ }M_1\text{
    }D_2\text{ }M_2\text{ }F_1\text{ }F_2\text{ }...\text{
    }F_M$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_1, M_1$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$01 \le D \le 31, 01 \le M \le
    12$</span>) is the start date, <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_2, M_2$</span> is the end date and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le F_i \le 200$</span>) is the number of
    times event <span class="tex2jax_process">$I$</span> was
    observed.</p>
<p>Note that the days <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_i$</span> and months <span class="tex2jax_process">$M_i$</span> will always be zero-padded to
    exactly 2 characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>One line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    numbers, the durations of the event types. If more than one
    solution exists, output any one. If no solution exists, output
    <tt class="ttfamily">“-1”</tt> (without quotes).</p>
