<p>Stan and Ollie are playing a guessing game. Stan thinks of a
    number between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> (inclusive) and Ollie
    guesses what the number might be. After each guess, Stan
    indicates whether Ollie’s guess is too high, too low, or right
    on.</p>
<p>After playing several rounds, Ollie has become suspicious
    that Stan cheats; that is, that he changes the number between
    Ollie’s guesses. To prepare his case against Stan, Ollie has
    recorded a transcript of several games. You are to determine
    whether or not each transcript proves that Stan is
    cheating.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Standard input consists of several transcripts. Each
    transcript consists of a number of paired guesses and
    responses. A guess is a line containing single integer between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> (inclusive), and a response is a
    line containing “too high”, “too low”, or “right on”. Each game
    ends with “right on”. A line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> follows the last transcript. There
    are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2500$</span>
    guess-response pairs in total.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each game, output a line “<tt class="ttfamily">Stan is
    dishonest</tt>” if Stan’s responses are inconsistent with the
    final guess and response. Otherwise, print “<tt class="ttfamily">Stan may be honest</tt>”.</p>
