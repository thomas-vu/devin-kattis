<p>Frosh commencing their studies at Waterloo have diverse
    interests, as evidenced by their desire to take various
    combinations of courses from among those available.</p>
<p>University administrators are uncomfortable with this
    situation, and therefore wish to offer a <em>conformity
    prize</em> to frosh who choose one of the most popular
    combinations of courses. How many frosh will win the prize?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10\, 000$</span>, the number
    of frosh. For each frosh, a line follows containing the course
    numbers of five distinct courses selected by the frosh. Each
    course number is an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$499$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The <em>popularity</em> of a combination is the number of
    frosh selecting exactly the same combination of courses. A
    combination of courses is considered <em>most popular</em> if
    no other combination has higher popularity. Output a single
    line giving the total number of students taking some
    combination of courses that is most popular.</p>
