<div class="problembody">
<p>As a level designer for Super Mawio Bros, you have been
    creating maps for Mawio to play on, each with some combination
    of blank spaces, bricks, and item boxes for Mawio to navigate
    on his way to save Princess Pweach. You want to make some of
    the maps more interesting, so you decide to add some waterfalls
    to them. These waterfalls naturally cascade around the bricks
    and item boxes that you have already placed as they flow down
    from the top of the screen.</p>
<p>Currently, the map contains nothing but bricks, item boxes,
    and blank spaces. Waterfalls will be placed at certain column
    numbers at the top of the screen. Given this information,
    output an updated map with the waterfalls displayed. Water
    flows straight down unless it is obstructed by a brick or item
    box. When water is obstructed by an obstacle, it will flow to
    both the right and the left of each obstacle, unless those
    locations are also obstructed. When water flows to the bottom
    of the map, it stops flowing at the spot it hits the bottom
    at.</p>
<p>In the current representation of the map, blank spaces are
    represented by the character ‘O’, bricks by the character ‘#’,
    and item boxes by the character ‘?’. In the updated
    representation, water should be represented by the character
    ‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$\sim $</span>’. There will be
    no bricks nor item blocks on the top layer of a level.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line containing three space separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n,m \leq 1\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq k \leq m$</span>). <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> represent the number of rows and
    columns in the map respectively. <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> represents the number of
    waterfalls that are to be added.<br/>
    The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> space-separated integers with each
    integer representing the column position <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq p_ k &lt; m$</span>) of a waterfall
    that needs to be added at the top of the map.<br/>
    The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> characters.
    These <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines represent
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \times m$</span> map of
    the level. Blank spaces are represented by the character ‘O’,
    bricks by the character ‘#’, and item boxes by the character
    ‘?’.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines with
    each line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    characters. These lines should represent a map that is updated
    to show the paths of the waterfalls, where water is represented
    by the character ‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$\sim
    $</span>’.</p>
