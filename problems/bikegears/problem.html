<p>Many multi-gear (multi-speed) bicycles have a drivetrain
    mechanism that is structured as follows: the pedals are
    attached to a front set of sprockets (toothed wheels), which is
    connected by a chain to a back set of sprockets, which in turn
    is attached to the rear wheel. The chain can shift, under the
    cyclist’s control, to any one of the front sprockets and to any
    one of the back sprockets (sometimes there are mechanical
    limitations that preclude certain front-back combinations, but
    we don’t have to worry about that here). As the cyclist moves
    the pedals forward, the force is transferred from the pedals to
    the selected front sprocket, to the chain, to the selected back
    sprocket, and finally to the rear wheel; it is the motion of
    the rear wheel that drives the bike forward.</p>
<p>The <em>gear</em> the bike is in at any point in time is
    given by the ordered pair <span class="tex2jax_process">$(f,b)$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> is the number of teeth on the
    currently selected front sprocket, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> is the number of teeth on the
    currently selected back sprocket. The ratio <span class="tex2jax_process">$f/b$</span> is used to compare gears. A
    higher (respectively, lower) ratio corresponds to a higher
    (respectively, lower) gear. Therefore, for example, to change
    into a lower gear, the cyclist can shift the chain either onto
    a smaller front sprocket or onto a larger back sprocket (or
    both). Most cyclists change gears easily and intuitively in
    response to variations in terrain. However, for bicycles with a
    relatively large number of gears, figuring out how to progress
    through the gears <em>in order from lowest to highest</em> can
    be surprisingly non-obvious, and in fact most cyclists likely
    do not know how to do this.</p>
<p>Given information about the front and back sprockets on a
    bicycle with the drivetrain structure described above, your
    task is to determine the exact sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$(f,b)$</span> sprocket pairs that a cyclist
    would need to select to progress, in order, through all the
    gears from lowest to highest. If two different gears,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(f_1, b_1)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(f_2, b_2)$</span>, yield the
    same ratio, then the gear with the lower <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> value is considered to be the
    lower of the two gears.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single test case given on three lines.
    The first line contains two space-separated integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq F,B \leq
    50$</span>)</span>, the number of front sprockets and the
    number of back sprockets, respectively. The second line
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> distinct
    space-separated integers in decreasing order, the number of
    teeth on each of the front sprockets. The third line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> distinct
    space-separated integers in decreasing order, the number of
    teeth on each of the back sprockets. Every sprocket has between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> teeth, inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line for each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$F \cdot B$</span> gears. Give these in order
    from the lowest gear to the highest gear. Each line has five
    parts: an opening parenthesis (‘<tt class="ttfamily">(</tt>’),
    an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> (the number
    of teeth on one of the front sprockets), a comma (‘<tt class="ttfamily">,</tt>’), an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (the number of teeth on one of the
    back sprockets), and a closing parenthesis (‘<tt class="ttfamily">)</tt>’).</p>
