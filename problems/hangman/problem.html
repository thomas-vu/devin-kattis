<p>Hangman is a (somewhat macabre) word-guessing game that can
    be played by two people. Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> thinks of a word consisting of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> letters, and draws a
    row of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> dashes on a
    piece of paper. These dashes correspond to the letters of the
    word, in the same order. Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> then attempts to discover the word
    by making a sequence of letter guesses. For each letter guessed
    by Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If the letter occurs one or more times in the word,
        Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> writes
        the letter above each corresponding dash.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the letter does not occur in the word,
        Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> adds
        one component to a drawing of a stick-figure man hanging on
        a gallows. The drawing (initially empty) has <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> possible components: base,
        vertical beam, horizontal beam, rope, head, torso, right
        leg, left leg, right arm, left arm.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    guesses all the letters in the word before the drawing of the
    hanging man is complete, then Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> wins (and Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> loses). Otherwise,
    Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> loses (and
    Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> wins).</p>
<p>Ned loves playing hangman, especially as
    Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, but he
    finds that he is not a very good letter guesser. To improve his
    chances, he decides to adopt a new strategy. For each word
    selected by Player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, Ned chooses a random permutation
    of the letters of the alphabet, and then simply guesses letters
    in that order until he either wins or loses. Given the word and
    Ned’s permutation of the alphabet, determine the outcome of the
    game.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two lines representing a single game
    of Hangman. The first line contains the word to be guessed, a
    non-empty string of uppercase English alphabet letters
    (<tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>–<tt class="ttfamily">Z</tt>) of
    maximum length <span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span>. The
    second line contains a permutation of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span> letters of the English alphabet,
    also uppercase.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If Ned wins the game by guessing letters in the order given
    by the permutation (proceeding from left to right), output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">WIN</tt>”. Otherwise, output “<tt class="ttfamily">LOSE</tt>”.</p>
