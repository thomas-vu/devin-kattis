<p>MyTunes, a new music application from Mapple, allows you to
    display and sort your music according to many different
    attributes. Attributes like album name, song title, artist, and
    song length are available, among others. One feature MyTunes
    does NOT have is stable sorting. You need to write the software
    which does this. Stable sorting would allow the user to do
    something like this: first sort the whole list by song title,
    and then sort the whole list by artist. The result is that the
    list of songs are sorted primarily by artist (since it’s the
    last thing used to sort), then within each artist they are
    sorted by song name (since before the artist sort, the songs
    were ordered by song name). When sorting two songs with equal
    attribute values they should remain in their relative order
    prior to sorting (giving stable sorting).</p>
<p>The first sort starts from the order of songs as given in
    the input. Each subsequent sort starts from the order given by
    the previous sort, rather than starting from the initial order.
    All sorting should be done least to greatest, in lexicographic
    order (using ASCII values, even for numeric data).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> unique attributes, separated by
    single spaces. The next line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 100$</span> giving the number
    of songs that follow, one song per line. Each song has the
    values for all the attributes, separated by single spaces. The
    next line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 20$</span> giving the number of sorting commands.
    The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    each contain one sort command, which is the name of an
    attribute. Initially, the song list is in the order given on
    the input. All attributes and values are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> characters, using only a–z, A–Z,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, and underscore (_).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>After each sort command, print the list of attributes
    followed by the song list in the order given by the sort
    command, one song per line. Print a space between adjacent
    fields. Between each pair of printed lists, print a blank
    line.</p>
