        A traditional circular caramel cookie (stroopwafel).
      </div>
</div>Stroopwafels – two crispy round waffles with a grid-like
    pattern on top, separated by a thin layer of gooey and
    delicious caramel – are simply the most amazing Dutch treat
    ever. Everybody loves them and your factory is known for making
    the best and the biggest stroopwafels in town… At least, until
    now.
    <p>This year, your archrival Rob had the audacity to open up
    another factory for stroopwafels and they have already
    announced that their stroopwafels will be even bigger than
    yours. Although the exact size of the new stroopwafels is a
    well-kept secret, your industrial spy managed to find out that
    the grid-like pattern of the stroopwafel consists of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> whole squares. You
    know for a fact that the area of each square is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1~ \text {cm}^2$</span> and that the centre
    point of the stroopwafel always contains the common corner of
    the four adjacent squares in the centre (i.e., the squares are
    aligned to a Cartesian grid), as shown in Figure 1.</p>

          cookie contains.

<p>Needless to say, there is no way that you will let Rob outdo
    you and you plan on releasing a new edition of bigger
    stroopwafels. Since the production of bigger stroopwafels is
    more expensive, you naturally want to make them as small as
    possible. Thus, you are interested in the minimum radius of a
    stroopwafel with strictly more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> squares.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq s\leq 10^9$</span>), the number of
        whole squares Rob’s stroopwafel has at most.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum radius in centimetres of a stroopwafel
    with strictly more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> whole squares. Your answer should
    have an absolute or relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
