<p>You have just moved from Waterloo to a big city. The people
    here speak an incomprehensible dialect of a foreign language.
    Fortunately, you have a dictionary to help you understand
    them.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\,
    000$</span> dictionary entries, followed by a blank line,
    followed by a message of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> words. Each dictionary
    entry is a line containing an English word, followed by a space
    and a foreign language word. No foreign word appears more than
    once in the dictionary. The message is a sequence of words in
    the foreign language, one word on each line. Each word in the
    input is a non-empty sequence of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> lowercase letters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output is the message translated to English, one word per
    line. Foreign words not in the dictionary should be translated
    as “eh”.</p>
