<p>Professor Cesium has created a new process to transform some
    chemical product into another type of chemical with some
    residues. The process is simple: he just needs to input a given
    number of molecules of type A, enter the output type B he
    desires and start the machine. It creates as many molecules of
    type B as possible. Unfortunately, professor Cadmium was
    jealous of his work and tried to sabotage the machine by
    inverting wires on his machine. Professor Cesium, alerted by
    one of his assistants, was able to repair the mistake. To
    detect any problem in the future, he is asking you to create an
    automatic way to compute the number of molecules that the
    machine should output. With this algorithm, he is able to
    detect whether his precious machine was tampered with.</p>
<p>Molecules are written as strings composed of uppercase
    letters (A–Z) and numbers. Uppercase letters represent atoms.
    Note that Cesium only uses single letters of the alphabet as
    abbreviations for atoms, so H, C, A, X, Y, …can be used but He,
    Mg, …cannot. If a letter is not followed by a number, it means
    there is only one atom of it. An atom followed by a number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq l &lt; 10^3$</span>) represents
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> copies of that atom.
    Atoms can appear multiple times in a chemical product.</p>
<p>For example: <tt class="ttfamily">H2OC100H</tt> means
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> atoms of H, then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> of O, then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> of C then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> of H again.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains the input molecule, a string of
        length at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\,
        500$</span>, followed by an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq k\leq 10^3$</span>, denoting how
        many of these molecules professor Cesium has.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second line contains the desired output molecule,
        given as a string of length at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 500$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The output consists of a single line containing the
        maximum number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> of
        output molecules we are able to construct using the input
        molecules.</p>
