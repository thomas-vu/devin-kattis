<p>When ninjas go to conferences they wear fake nametags. One
    ninja in particular wants to impress his Sensei. His Sensei
    chooses a new favorite number every day. The pupil wants to put
    a name on his nametag that encodes his Sensei’s favorite
    number! This name will consist of only lower case letters. He
    assigns a value to each letter, based on its position in the
    alphabet (e.g. <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{a}=1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{b}=2$</span>, ..., <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{z}=26$</span>). Then, he encodes the
    Sensei’s number by adding up the absolute values of the
    differences of every consecutive pair of letters. For example,
    the string <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{azxb}$</span>
    has the value of:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    |\texttt{a} - \texttt{z}| + |\texttt{z} - \texttt{x}| +
    |\texttt{x} - \texttt{b}| = |1 - 26| + |26 - 24| + |24 - 2| =
    49 \]</span>
<p>The name that the ninja will write on his nametag is the
    shortest string that encodes to his Sensei’s favorite number.
    If there’s more than one string of the shortest length, he’ll
    choose the one that comes first alphabetically. Given the
    Sensei’s favorite number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, find the string that the ninja
    should put on his nametag.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that
    your program may be run multiple times on different inputs.
    Each input consists of a single line with a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le k \le 1\, 000\, 000$</span>), which is
    the Sensei’s favorite number. There will always be a name that
    encodes to the Sensei’s number.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line with a string of lower case letters,
    which is the name that the ninja should put on the nametag to
    impress the Sensei.</p>
