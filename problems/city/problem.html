<p>Modan is playing a new action strategy game, where his goal
    is to destroy a city.</p>
<p>A city is made up of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> buildings, where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th building initially has health
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$H_ i$</span>. At every move,
    Modan can choose a building to attack, dealing <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> damage to it. When a buildingâ€™s
    health falls below or equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, it is destroyed. When the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th building gets
    destroyed, it explodes and deals <span class="tex2jax_process">$E_ i$</span> damage to the adjacent
    buildings, i.e. the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i-1$</span>-th and <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+1$</span>-th buildings, if they exist.</p>
<p>Modan is really addicted to the game and wants to know the
    minimum number of moves he needs to destroy a city.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 100$</span> giving the number of test
    cases. Each test case has three lines. On the first line, there
    are two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10\,
    000$</span>), the number of buildings, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq D \leq 10^9$</span>), the amount of damage Modan can do.
    On the second line, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers, with the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th integer being <span class="tex2jax_process">$H_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq H_ i \leq 10^9$</span>), the initial
    health of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    building. On the third line, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers, with the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th integer being <span class="tex2jax_process">$E_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq E_ i \leq 10^9$</span>), the amount
    of explosion damage the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th building does.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the
    minimum number of moves needed to destroy the city.</p>
