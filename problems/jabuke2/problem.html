<p>It is often heard that the apple doesn’t fall far from the
    tree. But is that really so?</p>
<p>The National Statistics Department has tracked the falling
    of apples in a fruit garden for <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> consecutive years. The fruit
    garden can be represented as a matrix with dimensions
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R \times S$</span>. Each field
    of the matrix can contain more than one apple tree.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, each year there was exactly one apple
    fall, so the Department decided to write down <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> pairs of numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r_ i, s_ i)$</span> that denote the row and
    column of the location where the apple fell during the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th year. Moreover, by
    next year, a new tree grew at that location.</p>
<p>Your task is to determine the squared distance between the
    nearest tree and the apple that fell, measured in unit fields
    of the matrix (we assume it is that tree from which the apple
    fell).</p>
<p>The distance between fields <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r_1, s_1)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r_2, s_2)$</span> in the matrix are
    calculated as</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{equation*} d((r_1, s_1),(r_2, s_2)) =
    \sqrt {(r_1-r_2)^2 + (s_1-s_2)^2} \end{equation*}</span>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq R, S \leq 500$</span>), the number of rows and columns of
    the matrix.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> lines contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> characters ’<tt>x</tt>’ or
    ’<tt>.</tt>’. The character ’<tt>.</tt>’ denotes an empty
    field, and the character ’<tt>x</tt>’ denotes a field with at
    least one tree.</p>
<p>The fruit garden will initially contain at least one
    tree.</p>
<p>After that, an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq G \leq 10^5$</span>) follows, the number of years the
    fruit garden has been under observation.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> lines describes the falls of the
    apples. Each line contains a pair of space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> that denote the row and column
    of the location where the apple fell in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th year (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq r_ i \leq R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s_ i \leq S$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> numbers, the
    required squared distances from the task, each in its own
    line.</p>
