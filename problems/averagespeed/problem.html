<div class="problembody">
<p>You have bought a car in order to drive from Waterloo to a
    big city. The odometer on their car is broken, so you cannot
    measure distance. But the speedometer and cruise control both
    work, so the car can maintain a constant speed which can be
    adjusted from time to time in response to speed limits, traffic
    jams, and border queues. You have a stopwatch and note the
    elapsed time every time the speed changes. From time to time
    you wonder, “how far have I come?”. To solve this problem you
    must write a program to run on your laptop computer in the
    passenger seat.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Standard input contains several lines of input (at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>): Each speed change
    is indicated by a line specifying the elapsed time since the
    beginning of the trip (in the format “<tt class="ttfamily">hh:mm:ss</tt>”), followed by the new speed in km/h
    (an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span>, inclusive).
    Each query is indicated by a line containing the elapsed time.
    At the outset of the trip the car is stationary. Elapsed times
    are given in non-decreasing order and there is at most one
    speed change at any given time.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query in standard input, you should print a line
    giving the time and the distance travelled rounded to exactly
    two digits after the decimal point, in the format below. (You
    may assume that the distance travelled is at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> away from any number that
    would be rounded differently.)</p>
