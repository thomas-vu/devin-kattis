<p>In the Republic of Remoteland, the people celebrate their
    independence day every year. However, as it was a long long
    time ago, nobody can remember when it was exactly. The only
    thing people can remember is that today, the number of days
    elapsed since their independence (<span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>) is a perfect square, and moreover
    it is the largest possible such number one can form as a
    product of distinct numbers less than or equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>As the years in Remoteland have <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 007$</span> days, their
    citizens just need <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>
    modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\,
    007$</span>. Note that they are interested in the largest
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>, not in the largest
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 007$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains at most 25 testcases. Every test case is
    described by a single line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 10\, 000\, 000$</span>). The input ends with a line
    containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the number of days ago the
    Republic became independent, modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 007$</span>, one per
    line.</p>
