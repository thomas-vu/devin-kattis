<p>Returning to the Beautiful Gloomy Outback (BGO) after a
    strenuous trip to the city, you hear a faint howl in the
    distance. Instantly you realize it is your friend Fenrir
    inviting you to a howling contest.</p>
<p>In order to make an impressive howl that wins the contest,
    you know that your howl must fulfill the following criteria in
    order to be valid:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>It must consist of a combination of the letters
        <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">H</tt>,
        <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">W</tt>. Each letter must occur at least
        once.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The howl can not contain two consecutive <tt class="ttfamily">W</tt>’s, or two consecutive <tt class="ttfamily">H</tt>’s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The howl can not contain an <tt class="ttfamily">H</tt>
        followed immediately by a <tt class="ttfamily">W</tt> or an
        <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There can never be an <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt> after
        the first occurrence of an <tt class="ttfamily">O</tt>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Can you produce a longer howl than Fenrir and win the
    contest?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>

    howl of Fenrir. Since Fenrir is a proper wolf, his howls are

    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> MB of computer
    memory.</p>
