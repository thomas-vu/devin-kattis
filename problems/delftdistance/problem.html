</div>You are currently in your hotel at the north-west corner
    of Delft, and want to go to the contest site at the university
    in the south-east corner of Delft. To get there, you have to go
    right through the historical centre of the city. Like
    Manhattan, the city consists of a grid of <span class="tex2jax_process">$h \times w$</span> buildings. But unlike
    Manhattan, the city does not only contain square residential
    buildings but also some round medieval towers. All the square
    buildings are axis aligned with a side length of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10~ \text {m}$</span> and all round towers
    have a diameter of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10~ \text
    {m}$</span>. There is just enough space for a small alley of
    negligible width between two neighbouring buildings.
    <p>Since you are already late for the contest start, you need
    to find a shortest path from your hotel to the contest site.
    Fortunately, you have a map of the city. See Figure 1 for
    an example.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq h,w \leq 700$</span>), the number
        of rows and the number of columns of buildings shown on the
        map of the city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> lines, each
        with <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> characters
        which are either ‘<tt class="ttfamily">O</tt>’ (for round
        towers) or ‘<tt class="ttfamily">X</tt>’ (for square
        buildings) describing the shapes of the buildings.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The map is oriented with the north side up.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the length of a shortest path from the north-west
    corner to the south-east corner of Delft in metres. Your answer
    may have a relative or absolute error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
