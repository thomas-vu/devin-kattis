</div>A famous travel web site has designed a new restaurant
    rating system. Each restaurant is rated by one of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 15$</span>) critics, each giving the restaurant a
    nonnegative numeric rating (higher score means better). Some of
    these critics are more influential than others.

    <p>The restaurants in each city are ranked as follows. First,
    sum up the ratings given by all the critics for a restaurant. A
    restaurant with a higher total sum is always better than one
    with a lower total sum. For restaurants with the same total
    sum, we rank them based on the ratings given by critic 1. If
    there is a tie, then we break ties by the ratings by critic 2,
    etc.</p>
<p>A restaurant owner received the ratings for his restaurant,
    and is curious about how it ranks in the city. He does not know
    the ratings of all the other restaurants in the city, so he
    would estimate this by computing the maximum number of
    different ratings that is no better than the one received by
    the restaurant. You are asked to write a program to answer his
    question.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a number of cases, at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span>. Each case is
    specified on one line. On each line, the first integer is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers containing
    the ratings given by the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> critics (in order). You may assume
    that the total sum of ratings for each restaurant is at most
    30. The input is terminated by a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = 0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input, print the number of different ratings that
    is no better than the given rating. You may assume that the
    output fits in a 64-bit signed integer.</p>
