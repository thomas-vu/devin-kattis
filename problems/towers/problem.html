<div class="problembody">
<p><em>Remark:</em> We were originally planning to give you
    this in the real contest, but since we have too many awesome
    problems for you for tomorrow and this one is just way too
    easy, we decided to move it to the dress rehearsal as a sneak
    preview.</p>
<p>In this problem we will be exploring the concept of sorting
    numbers. Most of you have likely written a sorting algorithm
    before, but just in case, here is a tutorial: You reorder the
    numbers to put the smaller ones in front and larger ones in the
    back.</p>
<p>Having dealt with the theory, we come to practice. You will
    be given some integers. Please output the same integers in
    sorted order. Where is the trick, you ask? Well, you might have
    to deal with equality cases. If two numbers are equal, the one
    that was the first in the input should also be the first on the
    output. Other than that, there are no tricks, no complications.
    Just sort the numbers from lowest to highest. Simple!</p>
<p>Oh, one more thing. When we say <i class="it">some</i>
    integers, we mean they might be somewhat large integers. To
    make life easier for you, we will express them in a simple
    “tower of powers” form. Each integer will be in the
    format</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ a_1^{a_2^{\ldots
    ^{a_ n}}}, \]</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a_1, a_2, \ldots
    , a_ n \leq 100$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 100$</span>. Note that evaluation is from top to
    bottom, thus</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    a_1^{a_2^{a_3}} = a_1^{\left(a_2^{a_3}\right)}. \]</span>
<p>Are you done yet? No? Better start working!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line of
    each test case contains the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> of integers in this test case,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq 100$</span>. Each
    of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines
    describes one of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    integers. The integer is written as described above, using the
    caret (<tt>^</tt>) to represent power, with no whitespace.
    There will be between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> numbers in the
    representation of each integer, and each of these numbers will
    be an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the case number (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>) followed by the sorted list of
    integers, one per line, in the original form.</p>
