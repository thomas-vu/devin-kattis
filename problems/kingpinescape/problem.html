<p>You are the kingpin of a large network of criminal hackers.
    Legend has it there has never been a richer criminal than you.
    Not just because you are the smartest, but also because you are
    the stingiest.</p>
<p>The police have been after you for years, but they have
    never been able to catch you thanks to your great set of escape
    routes. Whenever they want to catch you in one of your many
    hideouts, you quickly get away through your network of tunnels,
    back alleys and speakeasies. Your routes are set up so that
    from every hideout you have in the city you can get to any
    other hideout by following only your secret passageways.
    Furthermore, because you are such a penny-pincher, your network
    is the smallest possible: from every hideout to every other
    hideout there is precisely <em>one</em> route through the
    network, no more and no fewer.</p>
<p>Yesterday, your mole in the police force has informed you of
    an unfortunate fact: the police are on to you! They have gotten
    wind of your secret network, and will attempt to catch you.
    They are planning to block some of your escape routes, and
    catch you in the act. They will start blocking your secret
    passageways one by one, until you have nowhere left to go.</p>
<p>Fortunately, your headquarters are absolutely safe. If you
    can just get there, you are always fine. Furthermore, your mole
    in the police force can inform you immediately as soon as the
    police start blocking passageways, so that they only have time
    to block one of them before you get notified. If you get back
    to your headquarters before they block any more routes, youâ€™re
    safe.</p>
<p>You want to add some passageways to the network so that
    whenever at most one of them is blocked, you can still get to
    your headquarters from any other hideout. Since the news has
    not changed your frugality, you want to extend your network as
    cheaply as possible. Can you figure out the least number of
    passageways you need to add, and which ones you need?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The input starts with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 10^5$</span>, the number
        of hideouts in the network, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq h &lt; n$</span>, the location of
        your headquarters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n - 1$</span>
        lines, each with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a, b &lt; n$</span>, signifying
        that there is an escape route between location <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and location <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>An integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, the
        least number of escape routes you need to add to make the
        network safe again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines
        with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a,
        b &lt; n$</span> each, the hideouts between which one of
        the escape routes has to be added.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In case there are multiple solutions, any of them will be
    accepted.</p>
