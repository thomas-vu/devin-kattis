<p>In the game of Unusual Darts, Alice throws seven darts onto
    a <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>-foot by <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>-foot board, and then Bob may or
    may not throw three darts.</p>
<p>Alice’s seven darts define a polygon by the order in which
    they are thrown, with the perimeter of the polygon connecting
    Dart <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    Dart <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> to
    Dart <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> to
    Dart <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> to
    Dart <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> to
    Dart <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> to
    Dart <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>, and back to
    Dart <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. If the
    polygon so defined is not simple (meaning it intersects itself)
    then Alice loses. If the polygon is simple, then Bob throws
    three darts. He is not a very good player, so although his
    darts always land on the board, they land randomly on the dart
    board following a uniform distribution. If all three of these
    darts land within the interior of the polygon, Bob wins,
    otherwise Alice wins.</p>
<p>For this problem you are given the locations of Alice’s
    darts (which form a simple polygon) and the probability that
    Bob wins. Your job is to determine the order in which Alice
    threw her darts.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N\leq 1\, 000$</span>), indicating the
    number of Darts games that follow. Each game description has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> lines. Lines
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> each have a pair of real numbers
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> digits after the
    decimal point. These indicate the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinates of Alice’s seven darts
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1~ y_1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_7~ y_7$</span>), which are all
    at distinct locations. All coordinates are given in feet, in
    the range (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x_ i, y_ i \le
    2$</span>). The <span class="tex2jax_process">$8^\textrm
    {th}$</span> line contains a real number <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> digits after the decimal point,
    giving the probability that Bob wins. In all test cases,
    Alice’s darts do form a simple polygon, but not necessarily in
    the order given.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each Darts game, output the order in which the darts
    could have been thrown, relative to the order they were given
    in the input, so that Bob wins with probability <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>. If several answers are possible,
    give the one that is lexicographically least. Any ordering that
    would give Bob a probability of winning within <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span> of the given value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is considered a valid
    ordering.</p>
