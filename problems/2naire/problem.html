<div class="problembody">
<p>The player starts with a prize of $1, and is asked a
    sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> questions.
    For each question, he may</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>quit and keep his prize.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>answer the question. If wrong, he quits with nothing. If
        correct, the prize is doubled, and he continues with the
        next question.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After the last question, he quits with his prize. The player
    wants to maximize his expected prize.</p>
<p>Once each question is asked, the player is able to assess
    the probability <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> that
    he will be able to answer it. For each question independently,
    we assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is a
    random variable uniformly distributed over the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t \ldots 1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input is a number of lines, each with two numbers: an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 30$</span>,
    and a real <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le t \le
    1$</span>. Input is terminated by a line containing <tt class="ttfamily">0 0</tt>. This line should not be processed. There
    are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$300$</span> test
    cases.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, print the playerâ€™s
    expected prize, if he plays the best strategy. Output should be
    rounded to three fractional digits.</p>
