</div>You have just bought a new house, and it has a huge,
    beautiful lawn. A lawn that needs cutting. Several times. Every
    week. The whole summer.
    <p>After pushing the lawnmower around the lawn during the
    hottest Saturday afternoon in history, you decided that there
    must be a better way. And then you saw the ads for the new
    robotic lawnmovers. But which one should you buy? They all have
    different cutting speeds, cutting times and recharge times, not
    to mention different prices!</p>
<p>According to the advertisement, a robotic lawnmover will
    spend all its time either cutting the lawn or recharging its
    battery. Starting from a full battery, it will cut the lawn at
    a given rate of <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> square
    meters per minute for a cutting time of <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> minutes, after which it has run
    out of battery. Once out of battery, it will immediately start
    recharging. After recharging for <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> minutes the battery is full again
    and it immediately starts cutting.</p>
<p>You decide that in order for your lawn to look sufficiently
    prim and proper, the lawnmower that you buy must be powerful
    enough to cut your whole lawn at least once a week <em>on
    average</em>. Formally, if we start the mower fully charged at
    the beginning of the week and run it for exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> weeks, it needs to cut the whole
    lawn at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> times,
    for all positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>. But apart from this, you have no
    specific requirements, so among the ones that satisfy this
    requirement, you will simply go for the cheapest option. For
    the purposes of cutting your lawn, you may make the simplifying
    assumption that a week is always exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 080$</span> minutes long.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le \ell \le 10^6$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le
    m \le 100$</span>), the size of your lawn in square meters, and
    the number of lawnmowers to consider, respectively.</p>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines,
    each containing a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, separated by commas, describing a
    lawnmower as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the name of
        the lawnmower, a string of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span> printable characters (ASCII
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$126$</span>) excluding ‘<tt class="ttfamily">,</tt>’, neither starting nor ending with a
        space,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p \leq 100\,
        000$</span> is the price of the lawnmover,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq c \leq 100$</span>
        is the cutting rate in square meters per minute,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq t \leq 10\,
        080$</span> is the cutting time in minutes, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq r \leq 10\,
        080$</span> is the recharge time in minutes.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the name of the cheapest lawnmower capable of cutting
    your whole yard at least once a week on average. If several
    lawnmovers share the same lowest price, output all of their
    names, in the same order they were given in the input. If there
    is no such mower, output “<tt class="ttfamily">no such
    mower</tt>”.</p>
