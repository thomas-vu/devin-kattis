</div>Among many of the Catland club kittens it is important to
    keep a paw on the pulse of the latest fashions and trends in
    order to stay hip. When a new number is discovered in Catland,
    its coolness is primarily determined by its <em>meow
    factor</em>. For a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, its meow factor is the largest
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> such that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is evenly divisible by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> nine times (once for
    each life of a cat). We say that <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> nine times if, starting with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, you can divide it by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> without a remainder,
    take the result of the division and again divide it by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> without a remainder,
    and so on, dividing by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    nine times in total.

    <p>While some cats are naturally chic and have an innate
    ability to see the meow factor of numbers, others who struggle
    to stay in vogue can not even tell the difference between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\, 584$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4\, 711$</span> (the former clearly having a
    higher meow factor). Can you help those poor unfortunate cats
    lacking a sense of style, by writing a program to determine the
    meow factor of a number?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 2^{63}-1$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the meow factor of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
