<div class="problembody">
<p>Ever wonder what will happen when you meet a person who uses
    a different base system to talk about numbers? For example,
    when you hear someone saying this mysterious number <tt class="ttfamily">1010110001</tt> (which is in binary), can you
    quickly convert it to its decimal form, <tt class="ttfamily">689</tt>?</p>
<p>In Harkerland, everyone uses the octal numeral system (base
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>) when talking about
    numbers. Therefore, new immigrants often have difficulties
    parsing numbers quickly. One of them is Alex. Alex used to live
    in a place where the hexadecimal numeral system (base
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span>) is adopted. In order
    to adapt to the Harkerland lifestyle as soon as possible, he
    trains hard to perform fast octal-to-hexadecimal conversion.
    Before Alexâ€™s training finishes, he is going to rely on a
    program for the base conversion. Help Alex write such a
    program.</p>
<p>Use capital letters <tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\dots
    $</span>, <tt class="ttfamily">F</tt> to represent the values
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10, 11, \ldots , 15$</span> in
    hexadecimal.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The only line of input consists of a non-negative integer,
    written in base <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>. The
    given integer will have no leading zeroes and will be strictly
    smaller than <span class="tex2jax_process">$8^{200\,
    000}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the same integer, written in base <span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span>. The output must not include any
    extra leading zeroes.</p>
<h2>Explanation for sample data</h2>
<p>For Sample Input 1, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4444_8 =
    2340_{10} = 924_{16}$</span>.</p>
