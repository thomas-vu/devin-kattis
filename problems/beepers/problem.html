<div class="problembody">
<p>Karel is a robot who lives in a rectangular coordinate
    system where each place is designated by a set of integer
    coordinates (<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>). Your job is to
    design a program that will help Karel pick up a number of
    beepers that are placed in her world. To do so you must direct
    Karel to the position where each beeper is located. Your job is
    to write a computer program that finds the length of the
    shortest path that will get Karel from her starting position,
    to each of the beepers, and return back again to the starting
    position.</p>
<p>Karel can only move along the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> axis, never diagonally. Moving
    from one position <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i,j)$</span>
    to an adjacent position <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i,j+1)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i,j-1)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i-1,j)$</span>, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i+1, j)$</span> has a cost of one.</p>
<p>You can assume that Karelâ€™s world is never larger than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20 \times 20$</span> squares and
    that there will never be more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> beepers to pick up. Each
    coordinate will be given as a pair <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> where each value will be in
    the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through the
    size of that particular direction of the coordinate system.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>First there will be a line containing the number of
    scenarios you are asked to help Karel in (at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span>). For each scenario there will
    first be a line containing the size of the world. This will be
    given as two integers (<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-size and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-size). Next there will be one line
    containing two numbers giving the starting position of Karel.
    On the next line there will be one number giving the number of
    beepers. For each beeper there will be a line containing two
    numbers giving the coordinates of each beeper.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output will be one line per scenario, giving the minimum
    distance that Karel has to move to get from her starting
    position to each of the beepers and back again to the starting
    position.</p>
