<div class="problembody">
<p>Kathy is in charge of statistics for the girl’s basketball
    team at her high school. She meticulously records each basket
    made and the time it occurred. Her record book for a game might
    begin as follows:</p>
<pre>
         H  2 0:13
         A  2 0:19
         H  1 0:52
         H  1 0:52
         A  3 1:08
         ...
</pre>
<p>This indicates that</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>the home team (<tt class="tt">H</tt>) scored a
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>-point basket
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span> seconds into the
        game</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the away team (<tt class="tt">A</tt>) scored a
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>-point basket
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> seconds later</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the home team made two free throws (each worth
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> point)
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$52$</span> seconds into the
        game (recall that the clock stops when a free throw is
        made)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the away team made a three point basket <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> minute and <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> seconds into the game.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The coach is very impressed with all the statistics that
    Kathy keeps. Using these statistics, he would like to know how
    long each team was in the lead during the game. For example, if
    both teams went into an incredible shooting slump after the
    1:08 mark in the game and no more baskets were made until the
    end of the game (<span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span>
    minutes for a high school game) then the home team would have
    led for <span class="tex2jax_process">$22$</span> seconds (from
    0:13 to 0:19 and from 0:52 to 1:08) and the away team would
    have led for 30:52 (from 1:08 to 32:00).</p>
<p>Kathy is very proud of how impressed the coach is, but she’s
    not looking forward to going through each game record to
    determine how long each team was in the lead. Can you help
    her?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> indicating the number of scores in
    the game. Following this are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines of the form <tt class="tt">T
    p time</tt> where <tt class="tt">T</tt> is either ’<tt class="tt">H</tt>’ or ’<tt class="tt">A</tt>’, <tt class="tt">p</tt>
    is the number of points scored (either <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>) and <tt class="tt">time</tt> is
    the time the points were scored in either the form <tt class="tt">m:ss</tt> (if the time is less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> minutes) or <tt class="tt">mm:ss</tt>. All times are between 0:00 and 31:59 and given
    in non-decreasing order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display three things: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>) either an ’<tt class="tt">H</tt>’
    or ’<tt class="tt">A</tt>’ indicating which team won the game,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>) the length of time
    the home team was leading, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>) the length of time the away team
    was leading. Use the form <tt class="tt">m:ss</tt> for any time
    less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> minutes and
    <tt class="tt">mm:ss</tt> otherwise. All games will have a
    winner.</p>
