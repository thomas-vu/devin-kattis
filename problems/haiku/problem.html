<div class="problembody">
<p>A haiku is a Japanese form of poetry. It consists of three
    phrases of <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> syllables each.</p>
<p>Once a year, HiQ has a haiku contest, where employees submit
    their best poems. The poems are then judged based on a wide
    range of aspects, such as</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>creativity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>simplicity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>beauty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>whether the poem is actually a haiku</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This last point turned out to be quite a challenge for the
    judges (many problems arose when half the judges indexed
    syllables starting at <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    and the other half at <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>).</p>
<p>Can you help the judges to determine whether a submitted
    poem is a haiku, given a set of syllables? Note that there
    <b class="bfseries">may exist multiple decompositions</b> of a
    single word in the poem into syllables. In this case, you
    should determine whether <b class="bfseries">some</b>
    decomposition is a haiku.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le S \le 100$</span>, the
    number of syllables. The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> words separated by spaces (the
    syllables). Each syllable contains at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> lowercase letters <tt class="ttfamily">a-z</tt>.</p>
<p>Then, three lines containing the poem follow. Each line
    contains a (non-empty) list of words separated by spaces,
    representing a phrase. The words contain only lowercase letters
    <tt class="ttfamily">a-z</tt>. The length of each line is at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> characters
    (including spaces).</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that there exists <b class="bfseries">at
    least one</b> decomposition of the poem into the given
    syllables.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <tt class="ttfamily">“haiku”</tt> if the given poem
    is a haiku, and <tt class="ttfamily">“come back next year”</tt>
    otherwise (without the quotes).</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample Input 1</h2>
<p>One possible decomposition into a haiku is:</p>
<pre>
spe-lling ve-ry hard
ear-ly in mor-ning ti-red
i need cov-fe-fe
</pre>
<h2>Explanation of Sample Input 3</h2>
<p>No matter how the third line is decomposed, it contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> syllables instead of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, so it can not be a
    haiku.</p>
