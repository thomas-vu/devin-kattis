<p>Picture this. Your favourite code repository hosting site is
    hosting a conference at Chalmers. And you’ve gone to it.
    They’ve talked about a bunch of fun stuff like merge conflicts,
    accidentally discarding your changes and someone force-pushing
    their commit over yours so that all your work just goes to
    waste. They also brought up the importance of efficient text
    compression. Something about how if everyone indented their
    code with tabs instead of spaces, they would save a colossal
    amount of space. But at that point you weren’t really
    concentrating, since you knew there was going to be free lunch
    and you were starving.</p>
<p>After you get home, you check your own code. You realise,
    it’s all indented with spaces! And every single space takes up
    a whole byte. <i class="itshape">A whole byte!</i> Disgusted by
    this pointless waste of storage space, you convert all of your
    files to use tabs for indentation. But then you start to think.
    What if…tabs weren’t specifically four spaces wide? What if you
    could save even more space if tabs were some other width? You
    immediately get to work solving this problem.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with one number <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span>, the amount of files in your
    project. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span>
    files. Each file begins with a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>, the lines in your program. Each
    following “line” is represented by a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the amount of spaces used to
    indent that line. Your project can have up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> files, each with up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> lines. Oh, and your
    project is written in Python, so the line length can be up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$80$</span> of which <span class="tex2jax_process">$79$</span> characters can be spaces. (You’re
    a PEP abiding code golfer.)</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print two numbers, one on each line. First the width of your
    custom tab symbol in spaces, then the total amount of space
    saved in bytes.</p>
<h2>Things to note</h2>
<p>Your code still has to look the same after you’ve
    substituted some of the spaces with tabs. If you find two or
    more tab sizes that save the same amount of space, pick the
    smaller one. Tabs also have to be at least one space wide.</p>
