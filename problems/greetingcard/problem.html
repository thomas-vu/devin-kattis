<p>Quido plans to send a New Year greeting to his friend Hugo.
    He has recently acquired access to an advanced high-precision
    plotter and he is planning to print the greeting card on the
    plotter.</p>
<p>Hereâ€™s how the plotter operates. In step one, the plotter
    plots an intricate pattern of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> dots on the paper. In step two,
    the picture in the greeting emerges when the plotter connects
    by a straight segment each pair of dots that are exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 018$</span> length units
    apart.</p>
<p>The plotter uses a special holographic ink, which has a
    limited supply. Quido wants to know the number of all plotted
    segments in the picture to be sure that there is enough ink to
    complete the job.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> specifying the number
    of plotted points. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain a pair of
    space-separated integer coordinates indicating one plotted
    point. Each coordinate is non-negative and less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{31}$</span>. There are at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{5}$</span> points, all
    of them are distinct.</p>
<p>In this problem, all coordinates and distances are expressed
    in plotter length units, the length of the unit in the
    x-direction and in the y-direction is the same.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output contains a single integer equal to the number of
    pairs of points which are exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 018$</span> length units apart.</p>
