<p>Brojko and Brojana are happily married with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> little boys. The boys are named
    with distinct even integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_1,
    P_2, \ldots , P_ N$</span>.</p>
<p>Brojko and Brojana are expecting an addition to their family
    and have to come up with a nice name for the little girl. They
    have decided that the name will be an <em>odd</em> integer in
    the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[A, B]$</span>.
    Because they find all integers in that range equally beautiful,
    they have decided to choose the number which maximizes the
    distance to the name of the closest of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> boys.</p>
<p>More precisely, they seek an odd integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$X \in [ A , B ]$</span> such that the
    expression</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \min \{ |X - P_
    i| , i \in [ 1 , N ] \} \]</span>
<p>is as large as possible.</p>
<p>Write a program that determines the name for the little
    girl.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le N \le 100$</span>), the number of
    boys.</p>
<p>The second line contains N distinct positive even integers,
    the names of the boys. The integers will be less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>.</p>
<p>The third line contains the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le A &lt; B \le 10^9$</span>), the range of names they are
    considering for the girl.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output an integer, the name for the little girl. If there
    are multiple solutions, any one of them will be accepted.</p>
