<div class="problembody">
<p>A Japanese firefly has flown into a cave full of obstacles:
    stalagmites (rising from the floor) and stalactites (hanging
    from the ceiling). The cave is <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> units long (where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is even) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> units high. The first obstacle is
    a stalagmite after which stalactites and stalagmites
    alternate.</p>
<p>Here is an example cave 14 units long and 5 units high (the
    image corresponds to the second example):</p>
<div class="figure">

<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth ]{img1.png}" src="/problems/firefly/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:60.00%"/>
</center>
</div>
<p>The Japanese firefly is not the type that would fly around
    the obstacle, instead it will choose a single height and ram
    from one end of the cave to the other, <b class="bfseries">destroying all obstacles</b> in its path with its
    mighty kung-fu moves.</p>
<p>In the previous example, choosing the <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>:th level from the ground has the
    firefly destroying eight obstacles:</p>
<div class="figure">
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth ]{img2.png}" src="/problems/firefly/file/statement/en/img-0002.png" style="width:60.00%"/>
</center>
</div>
<p>This is not the best choice because the firefly will end up
    less tired if it chooses either level one or five, as that
    would require destroying only seven obstacles.</p>
<p>You are given the width and length of the cave and the sizes
    of all obstacles.</p>
<p>Write a program that determines the <b class="bfseries">minimum number</b> of obstacles the firefly needs to
    destroy to reach the end of the cave, and on how many distinct
    levels it can achieve that number.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 200\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le H \le 500\, 000$</span>, the length and height of the cave.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> will always be
    even.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contain the sizes of the obstacles, one per line. All sizes are
    positive integers less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two integers separated by a single space on a single
    line. The first number is the minimum number of obstacles the
    firefly has to destroy and the second is the number of levels
    on which that can be achieved.</p>
