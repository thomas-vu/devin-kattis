<p>The Borg is an immensely powerful race of enhanced humanoids
    from the delta quadrant of the galaxy. The Borg collective is
    the term used to describe the group consciousness of the Borg
    civilization. Each Borg individual is linked to the collective
    by a sophisticated subspace network that ensures each member is
    given constant supervision and guidance.</p>
<p>Your task is to help the Borg (yes, really) by developing a
    program which helps the Borg to estimate the minimal cost of
    scanning a maze for the assimilation of aliens hiding in the
    maze, by moving in north, west, east, and south steps. The
    tricky thing is that the beginning of the search is conducted
    by a large group of over <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> individuals. Whenever an alien
    is assimilated, or at the beginning of the search, the group
    may split in two or more groups (but their consciousness is
    still collective.). The cost of searching a maze is defined as
    the total distance covered by all the groups involved in the
    search together. That is, if the original group walks five
    steps, then splits into two groups each walking three steps,
    the total distance is <span class="tex2jax_process">$11=5+3+3$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line of input there is one integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 50$</span>, giving
    the number of test cases in the input.</p>
<p>Each test case starts with a line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le x, y \le 50$</span>. After this,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> lines follow, each
    which <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> characters. For
    each character, a space “ ” stands for an open space, a hash
    mark “#” stands for an obstructing wall, the capital letter “A”
    stands for an alien, and the capital letter “S” stands for the
    start of the search (there is exactly one “S” in the maze). The
    perimeter of the maze is always closed, i.e., there is no way
    to get out from the coordinate of the “S”. At most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> aliens are present in the maze,
    and everyone is reachable.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For every test case, output one line containing the minimal
    cost of a successful search of the maze leaving no aliens
    alive.</p>
