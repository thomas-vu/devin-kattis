<div class="problembody">
<p>Jimmy is performing in ByteLand today! Anthony the Ant is a
    huge fan of Jimmy’s music, so he can’t wait to get to the
    concert.</p>
<p>ByteLand consists of of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> intersections and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> roads. Every road is bidirectional
    and connects two distinct intersections. Anthony is currently
    on intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and
    the concert is being held at intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>. Anthony must get to the concert
    in <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> seconds and he can
    travel at <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    meter/second.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Anthony, he has a huge fear of spiders and
    ByteLand is full of spiders. Spiders reside at certain
    intersections in ByteLand. Anthony will choose a path from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> that maximizes <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>, the minimum distance between any
    intersection on the path and any spider, such that the path can
    be travelled in no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> seconds.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq N\leq 100\, 000$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq M\leq \min (200\, 000,
    n(n-1)/2)$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq T\leq 10^9$</span>).</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    lines specify the roads. A road is described by three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u, v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq u, v\leq N-1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$u\neq v$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq d\leq 10\, 000$</span>), which means
    that a <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> meters long
    road connects intersections <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>. It is guaranteed that at most one
    road connect any two intersections, and that there exists a
    path between any two intersections.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$s,
    t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq s, t\leq
    N-1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s\neq t$</span>,
    representing Anthony’s current location and the location of the
    concert. You may assume Anthony can always travel from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> in no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> seconds.</p>
<p>The last line contains a integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq K\leq N$</span>, denoting the number
    of intersections occupied by spiders, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq a_ i\leq N-1$</span> denoting the
    intersections with spiders.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the maximum <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>
    (as defined earlier) for the path Anthony takes.</p>
