<p>Paul Erdős (1913-1996) was a very prolific Hungarian
    mathematician. He is famous for the amount of mathematics he
    produced (about <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 475$</span>
    papers published during his lifetime), the number of
    professional collaborators and coauthors he worked with (he had
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$511$</span> coauthors), and his
    nomadic lifestyle. He routinely traveled to visit
    collaborators, staying with them long enough to work on a few
    ideas, before moving on to visit someone else. Whenever he
    encountered a mathematical proof he thought was particularly
    elegant, he would claim it came from “The Book” – a special
    volume in which he believed God kept all the best proofs of
    every mathematical theorem.</p>
<p>Erdős worked a lot on graph theory, which is concerned
    with the structure of connections between pairs of objects.
    Fittingly, we can treat the collaboration of mathematicians as
    a graph problem, where each person is represented by a graph
    node, and each coauthored paper forms edges between all pairs
    of nodes for the corresponding coauthors on the paper.
    Erdős  is directly connected with a lot of coauthors with
    whom he published papers, who are further connected to other
    coauthors by other publications, and so on. This has led to the
    concept of an <b class="bf">Erdős  number</b>. Erdős 
    himself has an Erdős  number of <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. All of his coauthors have an
    Erdős  number of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.
    Everyone who is a coauthor with one of his coauthors (but not
    with Erdős  himself) has an Erdős  number of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and so on. It’s
    become a matter of distinction to have a low Erdős 
    number.</p>
<p>Write a program to help people who have published papers
    find their Erdős  number – that is, the smallest number of
    coauthors linking them to Erdős.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of one database of paper coauthorship,
    containing up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000$</span>
    lines. Each line begins with an author’s name, followed by a
    space-separated list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$511$</span> coauthor names. Note that some
    authors list a limited set of his/her coauthors; but two people
    are considered coauthors if either lists the other as a
    coauthor. Paul Erdős  is one of the listed authors (always
    given as <tt class="tt">PAUL_ERDOS</tt>). Every name consists
    of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span> letters
    (a-z), hyphens, and underscores. Input ends at end of file.</p>
<p>Note: In the sample input, a limited set of Erdős 
    coauthors are listed for space reasons.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each author (the first name of each line in the input),
    print the author’s name and his or her Erdős  number.
    Print the authors in the same order they appear in the
    database. If some author has no connection to Erdős, print
    <tt class="tt">no-connection</tt>.</p>
