<div class="problembody">
<p>Yraglac recently decided to get into the wood cutting
    business, and now has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    customers who would like to have their wood cut. A piece of
    wood of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> takes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> time units to cut, and
    Yraglac can only cut a single piece of wood at a time. To
    maximize customer happiness, Yraglac would like to minimize the
    average total time a customer has to wait to have all of their
    wood pieces cut. Can you help him?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \leq 10$</span> giving the number of test
    cases. Each test case begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N \leq 10^5$</span>), the number of
    customers. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    follow, where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th
    line begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$W_
    i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq W_ i \leq
    10^5$</span>), the number of wood pieces that customer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> would like to have
    cut, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$W_ i$</span>
    integers, the sizes of the wood pieces of the customer. Each
    wood piece has a size between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> inclusive. The total number
    of wood pieces will not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^5$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the
    minimum average total time a customer will wait to have all of
    their wood pieces cut. Your answer will be considered correct
    if its absolute or relative error doesnâ€™t exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
