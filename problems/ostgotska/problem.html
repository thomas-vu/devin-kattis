<p>Anders talks in the Swedish dialect of <em>östgötska</em>.
    Unfortunately, this makes it somewhat hard to get a programming
    job in the Swedish capital of Stockholm. The trendy Stockholm
    hipsters only accept applicants speaking the standard Swedish
    dialect, <em>rikssvenska</em>.</p>
<p>To increase his chances of passing interviews, he wishes to
    practice talking rikssvenska. To help him with this, he wants
    you to write a program that can determine whenever he
    accidentally reverts to speaking östgötska.</p>
<p>A simple way of determining if a sentence is written in
    östgötska is if at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$40\%
    $</span> of the words in the sentence contains the letter
    <tt class="ttfamily">ä</tt>. For simplicity, this is encoded as
    the letter combination <tt class="ttfamily">ae</tt> (meaning
    any appearance of the substring <tt class="ttfamily">ae</tt> is
    to be regarded as an occurrence of the letter <tt class="ttfamily">ä</tt>).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains a sequence of
    space-separated words. Each word consists only of letters
    <tt class="ttfamily">a-z</tt>. There are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> words, and each word contains at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> letters
    <tt class="ttfamily">a-z</tt> (meaning that the <tt class="ttfamily">ae</tt> combination counts as two letters for this
    limit).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “<tt class="ttfamily">dae ae ju traeligt va</tt>” if
    the input sentence is in östgötska, otherwise output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">haer talar vi rikssvenska</tt>”.</p>
