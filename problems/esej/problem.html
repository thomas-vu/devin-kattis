<p>The impending doom called final examination is approaching
    this year’s high school seniors: one of the compulsory tasks is
    going to be writing an essay in their mother tongue. Mirko is
    under the impression that certain political parties are going
    to keep their promises, those regarding informatization and
    digitalization, which is why he thinks that this year’s essays
    are going to be marked by a computer, instead of a human.</p>
<p>To test his doubts, Mirko is going to write an essay that
    doesn’t necessarily make sense at all, but should pass the
    automatic basic conditions check. The essay passes the check
    if</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>it contains at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> words;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>every word contains at least one, and at most 15
        letters;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the used vocabulary is large enough, in other words, the
        essay contains at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$B/2$</span> different words.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mirko was up late last night watching Big Brother, so he is
    asking you to write such an essay instead of him. The essay
    should be output in a single line, using only lowercase letters
    of the English alphabet and spaces (therefore, without
    punctuation such as dots, commas and such). The words used can,
    but need not be, words from the English (or any) language.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains the integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq A \leq B \leq 100\, 000$</span>) from the task.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain any essay
    that meets the rules from the task.</p>
