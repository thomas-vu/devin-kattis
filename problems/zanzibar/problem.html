<p>Turtles live long (and prosper). Turtles on the island
    Zanzibar are even immortal. Furthermore, they are asexual, and
    every year they give birth to at most one child. Apart from
    that, they do nothing. They never leave their tropical
    paradise.</p>
<p>Zanzi Bar, the first turtle on Zanzibar, has one further
    activity: it keeps track of the number of turtles on the
    island. Every New Year’s Day it counts the turtles, and writes
    the total number in a small booklet. After many years this
    booklet contains a non-decreasing sequence of integers,
    starting with one or more ones. (After emerging from its egg on
    Zanzibar’s beautiful beach, it took Zanzi some time to start a
    family on its own.)</p>
<p>One day Zanzi realizes that it could also be the case that
    turtles from abroad come to Zanzibar, by boat or plane. Now it
    wonders how many of the inhabitants were not born on Zanzibar.
    Unfortunately, it can only derive a lower bound from the
    sequence in the booklet. Indeed, if the number of turtles in a
    year is more than twice as big as the year before, the
    difference must be fully explained by import.</p>
<p>As soon as Zanzibar has <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\,
    000\, 000$</span> turtles, the island is totally covered with
    turtles, and both reproduction and import come to a halt.
    Please help Zanzi! Write a program that computes the lower
    bound of import turtles, given a sequence, as described
    above.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 13$</span>), the number of
    test cases. Then for each test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing a sequence of space-separated,
        positive integers (<span class="tex2jax_process">$\leq 1\,
        000\, 000$</span>), non-decreasing, starting with one or
        more ones. For convenience, a single space and a 0 are
        appended to the end of the sequence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing a single
    integer: the lower bound for the number of turtles not born on
    Zanzibar.</p>
