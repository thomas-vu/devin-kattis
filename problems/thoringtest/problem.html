<p>Thore loves chatting with an AI chatbot. It will tell him
    that he is handsome, intelligent and that he sings like an
    angel, all the things he wants to hear. And it is never rude or
    makes spelling errors like those pesky humans. Now Thore wants
    your help to write a program that, given a list of correctly
    spelled words followed by a sentence, detects if the sentence
    contains spelling errors and therefore is written by a human.
    Note, however, that Thore does not care about the letter case
    of the words.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 1,000$</span>), the number of words that Thore
    knows. The following N lines each contain a correctly spelled
    word, each word is no longer than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> characters. This is followed by a
    sentence. The length of the sentence will not exceed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10000$</span> words.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the sentence contains any word not listed by the N
    correctly spelled words, output "Thore has left the chat", if
    all words are spelled correctly, output "Hi, how do I look
    today?"</p>
