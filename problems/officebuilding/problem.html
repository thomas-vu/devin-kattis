<div class="problembody">
<p>Company Z has purchased a land lot for their new office
    building. The land is shaped like a rectangular grid with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> rows and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> columns, in which each cell has a
    tree. The age of each tree is known.</p>
<p>Because Company Z is at the innovative front of the world,
    their new office building will not just be rectangular.
    Instead, it will have some exotic shape and a very special
    floor plan. The shape can be represented by some connected grid
    cells. There is no particular facing requirement of the
    building, and the floor plan can be rotated by <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span> degrees an arbitrary number of
    times. However, the floor plan cannot be flipped vertically or
    horizontally.</p>
<p>Company Z wants to choose a building location within their
    land lot. The trees in those cells that are occupied by the
    building will have to be cut down. Company Z would like to
    preserve the trees so that the sum of age of the remaining
    trees is as large as possible. Could you help them choose the
    best location for their new office building?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq r, c \leq 20$</span>), the dimensions
    of the land lot.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines each
    contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> integers
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> (both inclusive)
    describing the ages of the trees in the land lot.</p>
<p>The next line contains two integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq s \leq r, 1 \leq t \leq c$</span>), the dimensions of the
    floor plan.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> lines each
    contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> characters
    that describe the floor plan of the building. A hash
    (<tt class="tt">#</tt>) denotes a cell occupied by the building
    and a dot (<tt class="tt">.</tt>) denotes a non-occupied cell.
    There is at least one hash. It is guaranteed that the hashes
    form a connected shape. Two hashes are directly connected if
    their cells share a side, and a shape is connected when all its
    hashes are either directly or indirectly connected. There is no
    row or column in the floor plan that is completely empty.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the maximum sum of age of the trees
    that can be preserved.</p>
