<p>Business is booming at Big Bill’s Burger Shack. Bill sells
    the most convenient, customizable burger in town. Using either
    the shack’s website or mobile application, customers can
    request patties that are prepared precisely <em>to the
    second</em>. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    order consists of two integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span>, the amount of time each side
    of the patty should be cooked and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>, the exact time at which the
    customer would like to pick up their order.</p>
<p>Big Bill is a talented grill cook, and he only hires
    talented grill cooks. In a given second, a grill cook can use a
    hand to do at most one of the following:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>place a new patty on the grill,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>flip a patty that is already on the grill,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>remove a patty from the grill to serve it to a customer,
        or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>do nothing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each grill cook has two hands, so they can do up to two of
    the above actions in a second.</p>
<p>When a patty is placed or flipped on the grill, the side on
    the grill immediately starts cooking. For example, if a patty
    is placed on the grill at <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span> seconds, flipped at <span class="tex2jax_process">$600$</span> seconds, and removed at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$700$</span> seconds, then it has
    cooked <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> seconds on
    each side.</p>
<p>These customers are demanding — they want to be served
    exactly at <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>, and the
    patty must be cooked for exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span> seconds on each side. Once a
    patty is on the grill, it must not be taken off until the
    customer wants it served. Orders that are not prepared exactly
    to the customers’ specifications would ruin Big Bill’s
    reputation. However, he doesn’t want to hire more grill cooks
    than he needs to. What is the minimum number of grill cooks
    needed to serve all the orders?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100$</span>, the number of
    orders for Big Bill’s patties. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain two integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>. This means that the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th patty should be
    cooked for exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span>
    seconds on each side and needs to be served exactly at time
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>. It is guaranteed
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d_ i \leq
    600$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq t_ i \leq
    43\, 200$</span>, and that it is possible to cook every order
    to specification without taking an action before second
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the minimum number of cooks needed
    to prepare all of the orders.</p>
