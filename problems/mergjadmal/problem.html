<p>After turning in the draft of the problems for
    Forritunarkeppni Háskólanna á Íslandi the results were that the
    prose was too terse and dated. It had to appeal to a younger
    audience better, to use their language. This problem exists as
    a response to this criticism. This sentence is your last chance
    to turn back and spare your eyes from this horror.</p>
<p>Isn’t it way lame to have to chew through all these
    problems? Totally wack, not a good vibe. Way too many still
    feeling the wild weekend, a totally untubular feeling. But
    don’t trip, this problem will be a totally rad break from the
    mansplaining of the other problems. After finishing this
    problem you’ll be totally Knuthpilled and ACmaxxed, a sigma
    programmer, you’ll wreck the rest right away, no cap. Skibidi
    ohio gyatt rizz everyone at the next fortnite tournament with
    those mad skillz, you’ll be the goat of the party for sure.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input dumps a whole bunch of printable ASCII letters on
    you. Not more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span>
    of them though, so you can chill. And no whitespace, that would
    just be real un-rad of us. Watch out dude, it might be
    empty.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print <tt class="ttfamily">Mergjad!</tt> if <span class="tex2jax_process">$69$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$420$</span> appear in the input, otherwise,
    <tt class="ttfamily">Leim!</tt>.</p>
