<p>Engineers at Spectre Imaging have decided to start investing
    in smart clock market. They are creating a prototype clock that
    will be able to show some images.</p>
<p>The clock’s rectangular display consists of black-and-white
    pixels. A pixel can have two states: ON or OFF. Since it is a
    complicated process to construct such a display, Spectre
    Imaging came up with the idea to divide the pixels into groups,
    where all pixels in a group would either be ON or OFF.</p>
<p>Given the screen resolution of the clock and the set of
    pictures that must be shown on the display, what is the minimal
    number of groups that are needed do be able to display all of
    the pictures?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N, H, W \leq 100$</span>) – the number of images that must
    be shown, the height of the display in pixel, and the width of
    the display in pixels respectively.</p>
<p>After that follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    images. Each image consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> lines with <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> characters each. All of these
    lines consists only of a ’<tt class="ttfamily">*</tt>’ or a
    ’<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’ which correspond to a pixel being
    ON or OFF respectively in the picture.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer: the minimal number of pixel groups
    into which the display can be divided into in order to be able
    to display all the pictures.</p>
<h2>Explanation of sample 1</h2>
<p>One possible solution is to divide the display into the
    following for groups:</p>
<p>Explanation for sample input 1 (each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> pixel groups):<br/>
<tt class="ttfamily">1.. .2. ... ..4</tt><br/>
<tt class="ttfamily">1.. ... .3. ..4</tt><br/></p>
<p>Then, the first image can be displayed by turning on the
    first pixel group, the second image by turning on the first and
    the second group, and the third image by turning on the third
    group.</p>
<p>Note that pixel group <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> was never turned on, but every
    pixel still needs to belong to a group.</p>
