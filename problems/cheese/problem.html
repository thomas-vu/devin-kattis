</div>Of course you have all heard of the International Cheese
    Processing Company. Their machine for cutting a piece of cheese
    into slices of exactly the same thickness is a classic.
    Recently they produced a machine able to cut a spherical cheese
    (such as Edam) into slices – no, not all of the same thickness,
    but all of the same weight! But new challenges lie ahead:
    cutting Swiss cheese.

    <p>Swiss cheese such as Emmentaler has holes in it, and the
    holes may have different sizes. A slice with holes contains
    less cheese and has a lower weight than a slice without holes.
    So here is the challenge: cut a cheese with holes in it into
    slices of equal weight.</p>
<p>By smart sonar techniques (the same techniques used to scan
    unborn babies and oil fields), it is possible to locate the
    holes in the cheese up to micrometer precision. For the present
    problem you may assume that the holes are perfect spheres.</p>
<p>Each uncut block has size <span class="tex2jax_process">$100
    \times 100 \times 100$</span> where each dimension is measured
    in millimeters. Your task is to cut it into <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> slices of equal weight. The slices
    will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> mm wide
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> mm high,
    and your job is to determine the thickness of each slice.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq n \leq 10\, 000$</span> is the number
    of holes in the cheese, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le s \le 100$</span> is the number of slices to cut. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain
    four positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span> that describe a hole, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is the radius and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span> are the coordinates of the center,
    all in micrometers.</p>
<p>The cheese block occupies the points <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y,z)$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x,y,z \le 100\, 000$</span>, except
    for the points that are part of some hole. The cuts are made
    perpendicular to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span>
    axis.</p>
<p>You may assume that holes do not overlap but may touch, and
    that the holes are fully contained in the cheese but may touch
    its boundary.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> slice
    thicknesses in millimeters, starting from the end of the cheese
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$z=0$</span>. Your output
    should have an absolute or relative error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
