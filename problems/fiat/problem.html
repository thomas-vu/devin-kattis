<p>The king of Rectangle Land has just received a royal gift, a
    stairstep-shaped piece of wood with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> steps, from the neighboring
    kingdom of Stairstep-Shaped Piece of Wood With <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> Steps Land.</p>
<p>The king accepted the gift out of courtesy, but he actually
    has a disdain for stairstep-shaped pieces of wood with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> steps, as it reminds
    him of the time he fell down the stairs and tore a ligament. He
    decided to give you, his royal advisor, a royal fiat to divide
    this stairstep-shaped piece of wood with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> steps into more reasonable shapes:
    rectangles.</p>

<p>Having solved royal problems before, you were able to do
    this quickly. You realized that this would make a boring
    problem, so you decided to make it more interesting. Now, you
    must calculate how many possible ways there are to divide this
    stairstep-shaped piece of wood with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> steps into <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> axis-aligned, integer-dimension
    rectangles.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 100\, 000$</span>), the number
    of steps in the stairstep-shaped piece of wood.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer on a line by itself, the number of
    ways to divide this stairstep-shaped piece of wood with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> steps into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> rectangles.</p>
<p>Since this number can be quite large, you should output only
    the remainder after dividing this number by <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9+7$</span>.</p>
