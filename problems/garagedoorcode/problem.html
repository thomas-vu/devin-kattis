<div class="problembody">
<p>There have been an increasing number of laptop thefts in
    your area lately. After yours was recently stolen, too, you
    decided that you had enough and are going to do something about
    it! After asking around, you heard some rumors about where the
    stolen laptops have been hidden and you want to get your laptop
    back!</p>
<p>The rumors led you to a particular garage and you have
    decided to keep an eye on it to try to figure out how to get
    in. Over the course of the afternoon, you have seen a handful
    of people come, enter the garage, and then leave.</p>
<p>There’s a security keypad on the door. As you have watched
    carefully, you have observed different people putting in the
    code, but they enter different numbers of digits. You figure
    out that some, maybe all, of them are pretending to intersperse
    additional key presses just to confuse anyone who might be
    watching them. You look up the keypad manufacturer’s webpage
    and find that the keypad was designed to use codes with a
    predetermined length of <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> digits. Given the set of
    observations you’ve made of different individuals “entering”
    elongated variations of the code (each does contain the correct
    code), can you determine what the correct code might be? It is
    guaranteed that there will always be at least one correct code
    that matches all observations. There may be multiple codes that
    match; you must find all matching codes.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \leq K \leq 6$</span>), the number of digits specified by the
    manufacturer for a correct code, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 20$</span>), the number of elongated entry code
    sequences that you observed.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines contains a string of at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> and at most 12 digits (0-9). These
    are the elongated entry code sequences that you have
    observed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Determine all <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>-digit
    codes that match the full set of elongated observations.</p>
<p>On the first line, output <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, the number of codes that match
    the set of elongated observations. Then output <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines, each containing one of
    these matching codes, having sorted them in increasing
    lexicographic order.</p>
