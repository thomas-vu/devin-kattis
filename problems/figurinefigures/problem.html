<p>The Miniature Toy Association (or MTA for short) is
    releasing the latest edition of its brand of collectible
    figurines. MTA used to sell them individually, but now has
    decided to adopt a new business strategy that involves randomly
    choosing <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> figurines
    from the entire collection to be packaged and sold together as
    a ‘<span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack’. Each
    figurine in a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack is
    chosen independently and randomly with uniform distribution. As
    such, it is possible that a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack may contain multiple copies
    of a particular figurine.</p>
<p>Even though some figurines may be more valuable than others,
    every randomly assembled <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack is sold at the same price.
    Customers buying a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack of figurines do not know
    ahead of time which figurines will be inside, and so it is a
    matter of chance whether they get the figurines that they want
    most. While the price is the same across all <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-packs, the weight is not, as each
    figurine has a distinct integer weight in grams.</p>
<p>Before MTA releases its new line of figurines, its Chief
    Financial Officer (CFO) would like an executive summary with
    information about the proposed <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-packs. Specifically, the CFO wants
    to know: the greatest possible weight of a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack, the smallest possible weight
    of a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack, the number
    of distinct weights that a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack could have, and the expected
    weight of a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack. Note
    that the expected weight is the average (mean) weight across
    all possible distinct <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-packs, where two <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-packs are distinct if and only if
    one <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack has a
    different number of figurines of any particular weight than the
    other <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack. So, for
    example, a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack with
    weights <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 2,2,3,5\} $</span> is
    distinct from a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack
    with weights <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 2,3,3,4\}
    $</span> (even though they both have the same total weight).
    Also, a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack with
    weights <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 2,2,3,5\} $</span> is
    distinct from a 4-pack with weights <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 2,3,3,5\} $</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line of
    the input contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of different figurines
    to be produced, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq
    N\leq 40\, 000$</span>. The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space-separated integers
    representing the weight in grams of each of the figurines. Each
    weight, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, is an integer
    satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq k\leq 60\,
    000$</span>, and all <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    weights are distinct.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should consist of a single line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> space-separated values. The first
    value should be an integer, the maximum weight of a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack in grams for the
    given set of figurines. The second value should be an integer,
    the minimum weight of a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack in grams for the given set of
    figurines. The third value should be an integer, the number of
    distinct weights that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-packs can have for the given set
    of figurines. The fourth value should be a floating-point
    value, the expected weight of a <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>-pack in grams for the given set of
    figurines, with an absolute or relative error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span>.</p>
