<p>Mirkos village has only one long street stretching from east
    to west with M houses. Each house has a unique house number,
    starting with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    ending with <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>.</p>
<p>Recent storm took out most phone lines so the mayor financed
    construction of a new one. Mirko is interested in the
    popularity of this new phone network, so he infiltrated its
    construction and placed special detectors on some points.</p>
<p>Detector detects any phone call made between two houses, as
    long as one of them is eastward and the other westward from the
    point the detector is installed.</p>
<p>At the end of the first month, Mirko removed all detectors
    and now wonders what is the smallest number of phone calls that
    could have been made during that month.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 100\, 000$</span>), the number of detectors, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$N &lt; M \le 1\, 000\, 000\, 000$</span>),
    the number of houses in the village. The houses are numbered
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (inclusive).</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contains two numbers each: <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_
    i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P_ i &lt;
    M$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le C_ i \le 1\, 000\, 000\,
    000$</span>), the position and total number of phone calls
    detected by detector numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. We say that a detector is on
    position <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span> if it is
    between houses numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i
    +1$</span>.</p>
<p>There will never be more than one detector on the same
    position.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the minimal number of phone calls
    made.</p>
