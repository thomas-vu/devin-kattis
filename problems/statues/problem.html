<p>Central City is best known for its famous Statue Park. The
    park is laid out as a grid, with each grid square housing
    either a statue or some park water feature (see Figure 1a). The
    statues come in all shapes and sizes and therein lies the
    problem, as some of the statues are so large that they obscure
    the view of others from the main paths surrounding the park —
    roads N, E, S and W. The Park Statue Keeper is Milo D. Venus
    and he wants to move some of the statues so that visitors on
    two of these paths can see all of the statues. He realizes that
    one way to do this is to pick a corner of the park and then
    start placing the statues along the diagonals of the grid in
    order of the diagonals’ distance from the selected corner,
    skipping over any water feature squares. The smallest statue
    would be placed in the first diagonal (assuming there is no
    water feature there). The next smallest statues will be placed
    in the second diagonal (this could be <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> statues depending on the number of
    water feature squares in the diagonal). The next smallest
    statues are placed in the third diagonal, and so on. With this
    scheme though there are a lot of choices to make. For example,
    if you wanted the best viewing to be along roads N and W, you
    would use the diagonals in Figure 1b placing the smallest
    statue in diagonal <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>,
    the next smallest in diagonal <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, the next three smallest in
    diagonal <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, the next two
    smallest in diagonal <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>,
    and so on. If you wanted the best viewing to be along roads W
    and S you would use the diagonals in Figure 1c placing the
    smallest statue in diagonal <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, the next two smallest in diagonal
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, the next three
    smallest in diagonal <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>,
    the next smallest in diagonal <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, and so on. Within any diagonal
    which can fit more than two statues the placement of those
    statues can be in any order, leading to even more choices.</p>

<p>Given all this flexibility it seems natural to pick the
    scheme that minimizes the number of statues that need to be
    moved, but which scheme is best is not immediately clear. Now
    Milo is a very competent administrator and very charming (he’s
    downright disarming) but he’s not all that great in solving
    problems like this. Can you carve out some time to help
    him?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with two positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$n,m \leq 50$</span>) specifying the number
    of rows and columns in the park grid. After this are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> rows each containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> integers. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{\text {th}}$</span> value in
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> row
    indicates what is located in row <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, column <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> in the park grid. If this value is
    positive it indicates a statue of that height; if it is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> it indicates a water
    feature. No two statues will have the same height.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum number of statues that need to be moved
    among all the various ways they can be placed with the scheme
    described above.</p>
