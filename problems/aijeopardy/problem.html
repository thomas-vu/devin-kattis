</div>The robot revolution is finally here, albeit not quite in
    the highly explosive way envisioned in various science fiction
    books and movies. It seems that, perhaps due to a small typo in
    the AI source code, the robots are not taking our lives but
    instead taking our livelihoods. One early job market fatality
    in this revolution was the (somewhat niche) occupation as
    jeopardy player: already in 2011 the <em>Watson</em> computer
    defeated two legendary but inferior human jeopardy champions.
    <p>Nowadays, more and more of Jeopardy’s <em>viewers</em> are
    AIs themselves and as such the show is considering having
    categories on topics that are more popular with this new
    number-crunching viewer base. Focus group testing has revealed
    that AIs are particularly fond of the “Binomial Coefficients”
    category. The premise of this category is that the answer that
    contestants get is some positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, and the contestants must respond
    with a question of the form “What is <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> choose <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>?” (and this is a correct response
    if the binomial coefficient <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> choose <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> equals <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>).</p>
<p>Write an AI to play this new Jeopardy category. If there are
    several different possible solutions for <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, the AI should choose the most
    elegant solution, having the smallest value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, and of those with the smallest
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> it should choose the
    one with the smallest value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le X \le 10^{100}$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two non-negative integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> such that the binomial coefficient
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> choose <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> equals <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, with ties between multiple
    solutions broken as explained above.</p>
