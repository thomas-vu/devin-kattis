<div class="problembody">
<p>You are going to buy <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> books of different kinds (numbered
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>), and are currently checking the
    different Internet book stores for prices. Each book is sold by
    at least one book store, and can vary in prices between the
    different stores. Furthermore, each book store incurs a postage
    fee if you order from it. Postage may vary between the various
    book stores, but it is always the same for a book store no
    matter how many books you decide to order. Compute the smallest
    amount of money you need to pay for all the books. You may
    order any number of books from any number of the book
    stores.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 100$</span>), the number of books to buy, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le M \le 15$</span>), the number of book
    shops.</p>
<p>Each book shop is then described in the input. A book shop
    is described first by two integers denoting the number of books
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (of the ones you are
    going to buy) present in the book shop, and the postage fee for
    the shop. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    lines each contains two integers: the number of a book present
    in the book store, and its price.</p>
<p>All prices and the postage fee are in whole Swedish crowns,
    and do not exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\,
    000$</span>. The book prices are always positive, but the
    postage fee can be free in some stores.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The program should output the smallest amount that the books
    cost, including the postage fee of all shops you choose to
    purchase from.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>Your program will be tested on <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> cases. Each case is worth
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> points.</p>
