<div class="problembody">
<p>Your friend has gotten lost in the woods. He has called and
    asked for you to come get him, but you are very busy and would
    rather just stay home. You quickly look up a map of the woods.
    It appears that the woods consist of a small number of
    clearings, with paths connecting them. You hope that the woods
    are sufficiently small and simple that your friend can get out
    easily, even if he is just randomly running around.</p>
<p>From your friendâ€™s description, you can figure out at which
    clearing he is. Assuming that every time he reaches a clearing,
    he runs in a uniformly random direction (including back the way
    he came), and that it takes him exactly one minute to get from
    clearing to clearing, can you predict how long it will take him
    to get out on average?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the number of clearings in the
    woods (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq
    20$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> is
    the total number of paths between clearings. The clearings are
    numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> through
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span>, such that clearing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> is the one where your
    friend is right now and clearing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> is the exit of the woods.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines each
    contain two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>, indicating a path
    between clearing <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> and
    clearing <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq K, L &lt; N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K \neq L$</span>).</p>
<p>You may assume that it is possible for your friend to reach
    the exit by following paths, that paths do not cross, and that
    there is at most one path between any two clearings.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing a single number: the
    expected value of the number of minutes it will take your
    friend to get out of the woods.</p>
<p>Your answer may have an absolute error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span>.</p>
