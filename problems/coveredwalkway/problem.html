<div class="problembody">
<p>Your university wants to build a new walkway, and they want
    at least part of it to be covered. There are certain points
    which must be covered. It doesn’t matter if other points along
    the walkway are covered or not.</p>
<p>The building contractor has an interesting pricing scheme.
    To cover the walkway from a point at <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> to a point at <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, they will charge <span class="tex2jax_process">$c + (x-y)^2$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is a constant. Note that it is
    possible for <span class="tex2jax_process">$x=y$</span>. If so,
    then the contractor would simply charge <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>.</p>
<p>Given the points along the walkway and the constant
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, what is the minimum
    cost to cover the walkway?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single test case. The test case will
    begin with a line with two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 1\, 000\, 000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le c \le 10^{9}$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of points which must
    be covered, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is the
    contractor’s constant. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines will contain a single
    integer, representing a point along the walkway that must be
    covered. The points will be in order, from smallest to largest.
    All of the points will be in the range from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>, inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, representing the minimum cost to
    cover all of the specified points. All possible inputs yield
    answers which will fit in a signed <span class="tex2jax_process">$64$</span>-bit integer.</p>
