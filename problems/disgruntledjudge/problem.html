<div class="problembody">
<p>Once upon a time, there was an <span class="scshape">nwerc</span> judge with a tendency to create slightly
    too hard problems. As a result, his problems were never solved.
    As you can image, this made our judge somewhat frustrated. This
    year, this frustration has culminated, and he has decided that
    rather than spending a lot of time constructing a well-crafted
    problem, he will simply write some insanely hard problem
    statement and just generate some random input and output files.
    After all, why bother having proper test data if nobody is
    going to try the problem anyway?</p>
<p>Thus, the judge generates a testcase by simply letting the
    input be a random number, and letting the output be another
    random number. Formally, to generate the data set with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases, the judge
    generates <span class="tex2jax_process">$2T$</span> random
    numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, \ldots ,
    x_{2T}$</span> between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>, and then
    writes <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, followed by
    the sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, x_3, x_5,
    \ldots , x_{2T-1}$</span> to the input file, and the sequence
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2, x_4, x_6, \ldots ,
    x_{2T}$</span> to the output file.</p>
<p>The random number generator the judge uses is quite simple.
    He picks three numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span> (inclusive), and then for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> from <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$2T$</span> lets</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ x_ i = (a \cdot x_{i-1} + b) \bmod {10\,
    001}. \]</span>
<p>You may have thought that such a poorly designed problem
    would not be used in a contest of such high standards as
    <span class="scshape">nwerc</span>. Well, you were wrong.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of
    testcases, at most 100. After that per testcase:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing an integer n (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le n \le 10\, 000$</span>): an input
        testcase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The input file is guaranteed to be generated by the process
    described above.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per testcase:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an integer giving the answer for the
        testcase.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If there is more than one output file consistent with the
    input file, any one of these is acceptable.</p>
