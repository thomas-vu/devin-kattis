<p>“Our high speed camera failed at the most inappropriate
    moment,” said the director of the ZOO. “This sequence with the
    falcon hurtling towards the ground at <span class="tex2jax_process">$250\, \mathrm{km}/\mathrm{h}$</span> is
    absolutely stunning. I had hopes that we could use the last
    frame as a promotion picture, it would look great with the
    autumn trees in the background. But the falcon is too high,
    even in this very last frame caught by the camera before it
    broke.”</p>
<p>“Cut out the falcon from the picture in Photoshop and just
    move it downwards,” said the falconer. “It’s a routine photo
    manipulation.”</p>
<p>“That would be unnatural,” objected the director. “We cannot
    show the public such obviously doctored pictures.”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, that would be quite natural,” replied the
    falconer. “Look, the falcon in such speed does not change its
    orientation so much, its shape in the picture remains virtually
    the same in a few consecutive frames. So if you move it down
    artificially it would still be a very good approximation of the
    natural situation which really occurred during the
    filming.”</p>
<p>After some hesitation, the director agreed with the
    proposition.</p>
<p>You are given two last frames of the camera with the
    silhouette of the falcon in both frames. The background in the
    frames is identical, only the silhouette of the falcon is at a
    different position in both frames. The falcon is moving at a
    constant speed and the time between consecutive camera frames
    is also constant. Your task is to reconstruct the missing next
    frame in which the position of the falcon silhouette is changed
    according to its speed and to the speed of the camera. The
    background in the new frame should be the same as the
    background in the previous two frames.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each test case starts with a line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq M, N \leq 1\, 000$</span>) and a printable ASCII character
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> enclosed in single
    quotes. The values on the line are separated by spaces. Next,
    there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines, one
    empty line, and other <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    lines. The first <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines
    represent the first frame, the last <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines represent the second frame.
    Each nonempty line contains string of exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> printable ASCII characters. Each
    character represents one pixel of the original frame. Each
    frame contains a complete silhouette of the falcon. In both
    frames all silhouette pixels are represented by the character
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> and all pixels which
    do not belong to the silhouette are represented by characters
    other than <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>. The pixels
    of the silhouettes in both frames do not overlap even
    partially, in other words, no coordinates of a pixel of the
    silhouette in the first frame are the same as the coordinates
    of any pixel of the silhouette in the second frame. The shapes
    of the silhouettes in both frames are identical. The silhouette
    in any frame can be shifted by some number of pixels
    horizontally and/or vertically so that its position exactly
    matches the position of the silhouette in the other frame. The
    silhouettes do not rotate. For various technical reasons the
    silhouette image might not be connected, it may comprise of
    more disconnected regions in the frame.</p>
<p>A printable ASCII character is an element of the subset of
    ASCII characters starting with the exclamation mark character
    (’<tt class="ttfamily">!</tt>’, ASCII code <span class="tex2jax_process">$33$</span> in decimal) and ending with the
    tilde character (’<tt class="ttfamily">~</tt>’, ASCII code
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$126$</span> in decimal).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print a picture frame consisting of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> characters each. The
    frame should represent the result of exact extrapolation of the
    falcon’s movement based on the two input frames. If the
    silhouette image in the second input frame is shifted
    horizontally and vertically by some number of pixels relatively
    to the first input frame then the silhouette image in the
    result frame should be shifted horizontally and vertically by
    the same number of pixels relatively to the second frame. It is
    possible that the falcon’s silhouette might appear in the frame
    picture only partially or it may not appear there at all. Print
    one empty line after each case.</p>
