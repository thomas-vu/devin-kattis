<p>In the city of Capitalistan, all education is performed at
    private school in which parents pay for their students to go to
    a certain school. Generally, parents base their choice of
    school on a variety of factors, such as closeness to the home,
    class size, teaching style and of course, standardized test
    results. Every year, all the students in Capitalistan take a
    standardized test, reciving an integer score between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>.</p>
<p>Sigmund is the teacher of a small urban school, with only
    capacity for a single class each year. Due to the small class
    size, the variance of the test results sometimes occasionally
    make it seem as if his class performed very poorly at the
    standardized test. Sigmund, who in reality is one of the best
    teachers in the country, does not like this fact.</p>
<p>Luckily, the standardized tests are graded at the school at
    which they are written and then reported in to the country’s
    education authority. This makes it possible for less scrupulous
    schools to be a bit generous when reporting their results.
    Since students know what they answered, they would become very
    suspicious if their results were altered. Similarly, the school
    can not ignore certain students when reporting results as they
    are used for assigning grades to the students.</p>
<p>Instead, the school can simply add additional results to
    raise their average score. Sigmund wants to forge some
    additional results so that his school increases its average to
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>. Since forging
    results takes a lot of time, he wants to add as few additional
    results as possible. How many results need to be added to raise
    the average score to exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, given the current results of the
    students?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 30$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le P \le 100$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the number of students in
    Sigmund’s class, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>
    the average score he wants.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>. These are the scores Sigmund’s
    students obtained on the test. It is guaranteed that the
    average score of his students is strictly less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is not possible to raise the average to <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> by adding additional tests, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”. Otherwise, output the
    least number of results Sigmund must add to his current set of
    results to raise the average to exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>.</p>
