        A very large collection of dice.
      </div>
</div>
<p>You are about to leave home for your weekly game of Pumpkins
    and Flagons (P&amp;F) when a text comes in asking you to bring
    a large collection of identical P&amp;F dice. They have asked
    the right person, for you have a very large collection of
    P&amp;F dice which, unfortunately, is currently unsorted.</p>
<p>These dice are ordinary cubes with a number on each of the
    six faces. The numbers are in the range 1–6, but they do not
    need to be distinct. For example, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} $</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\} $</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 2, 2, 2, 4, 4, 5\} $</span>
    are all valid sets of numbers for the six faces. For this
    problem you want to find the size of the largest set of
    identical dice you can create from your very large collection.
    Two dice are considered identical to each other if it is
    possible to rotate one of the dice so that their top numbers
    are the same, their bottom numbers are the same, and so on for
    all six faces.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$( 1
    \leq n \leq 500\, 000)$</span>, indicating the number of dice
    in your collection. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contains six integers
    in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>, separated by spaces, giving, in
    order, the numbers that appears on the top, bottom, front,
    back, left and right faces (see Figure 1).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single integer giving the size of the largest set of
    identical dice that can be made from given collection.</p>
