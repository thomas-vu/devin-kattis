<p>Rar the Cat<span class="tex2jax_process">$^($</span>™<span class="tex2jax_process">$^)$</span> is the founder of <span class="scshape">ACM</span> (Association of Cats and Magical Lights).
    This is the story of the founding of <span class="scshape">ACM</span>.</p>
<p>It is the second half of the year again and Rar the
    Cat<span class="tex2jax_process">$^($</span>™<span class="tex2jax_process">$^)$</span> is looking forward to Christmas.
    When people think of Christmas, Christmas trees will surely
    come into the picture. This year, Rar the Cat<span class="tex2jax_process">$^($</span>™<span class="tex2jax_process">$^)$</span> decides to decorate a Christmas
    tree with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> LED lights
    with up to 100 different colours. Each LED light can only have
    a single colour as Rar the Cat<span class="tex2jax_process">$^($</span>™<span class="tex2jax_process">$^)$</span> is too poor to afford more
    sophisticated models of LED lights.</p>
<p>Being a programmer himself, Rar the Cat<span class="tex2jax_process">$^($</span>™<span class="tex2jax_process">$^)$</span> LED lights are arranged in a tree
    formation on the Christmas tree. That being said, each LED
    light can be represented as a node and the wires between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> LED lights can be
    represented as an edge. The whole formation consists of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> nodes fully connected
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> edges. The nodes
    are labelled from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and each node can hold
    colour denoted as <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>. It is noted that
    each LED is connected to every other LED directly or indirectly
    by wires and the tree formed is rooted at node <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>.</p>
<p>Hubert the Cow finds that Rar the Cat<span class="tex2jax_process">$^($</span>™<span class="tex2jax_process">$^)$</span> Christmas tree is too boring
    because it lacks some magical colours. A magical colour in a
    subtree is defined as a colour whereby there is an odd number
    of LEDs with that particular colour within the subtree
    only.</p>

<div class="description"></div>
</div>In the tree to the right, the subtree of node
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> has <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> white nodes and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> black nodes. As such, white is a
    magical colour for the subtree of node <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. However, the subtree of node
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> has <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> white node and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> black node, thus the number of
    magical colour of the subtree of node <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>. In addition, all leaf nodes of
    the tree have <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> magical
    colour by definition.

    <p>In order to improve on his Christmas tree decorations, Rar
    the Cat<span class="tex2jax_process">$^($</span>™<span class="tex2jax_process">$^)$</span> intends to modify the colours of
    the LED lights on the tree. However, he does not know how to
    count how many magical colours there are.</p>
<p>Your task, is now to answer how many magical colours there
    are in a subtree requested by Rar the Cat<span class="tex2jax_process">$^($</span>™<span class="tex2jax_process">$^)$</span>. This will be done in between Rar
    the Cat<span class="tex2jax_process">$^($</span>™<span class="tex2jax_process">$^)$</span> modifications. There will be
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> queries and
    modifications in total.</p>
<p>Soon after this, Rar the Cat<span class="tex2jax_process">$^($</span>™<span class="tex2jax_process">$^)$</span> Christmas tree with these magical
    lights become so popular and Rar the Cat<span class="tex2jax_process">$^($</span>™<span class="tex2jax_process">$^)$</span> founded <span class="scshape">ACM</span> to further spread the adoption of such
    trees worldwide.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line will consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> will be positive and not more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$300\, 000$</span> while
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> will be positive and
    not more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers will
    follow on the next line. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> integer will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ i$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ i$</span> denotes the colour of node
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and can only range
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> inclusive.</p>
<p>The next line will have <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> integers. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> integer will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_{i+1}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_{i+1}$</span> denotes the parent node of
    node <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+1$</span>.</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines will then
    follow with <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> integers
    each, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, then this line represents a query
    for how many magical colours are there in the subtree of node
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> is an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, then it means that the colour
    of node <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is changed to
    colour <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query when <span class="tex2jax_process">$K =
    0$</span>, output in one line: the number of magical colours in
    the subtree of <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>
    (inclusive).</p>
