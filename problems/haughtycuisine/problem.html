<p>As a waiter, your favourite question from an indecisive
    punter is “I’m not sure, what would you recommend?” — so much
    so, in fact, that you decided to automate away the answer to
    avoid having to spend any brain cycles on this question ever
    again.</p>
<p>You have the list of all set menus for today and you are
    going to simply pick one at random. As long as your
    recommendation corresponds to a list of items on a set menu,
    everything will be fine.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 100$</span>, the number of
        set menus.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, one for
        each menu. Each of these lines contains a single integer
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq d\leq 42$</span>,
        followed by a list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> dishes that the meal consists
        of.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each dish is described using at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> lowercase Latin characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, the number of dishes that you
    recommend, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines containing the dishes you recommend.</p>
<p>If there are multiple possible solutions, you may output any
    one of them.</p>
