<p>Sudoku puzzles come in all different shapes and difficulty
    levels. Traditionally a Sudoku puzzle is a <span class="tex2jax_process">$9\times 9$</span> grid. Initially, some of
    the cells are filled in with numbers and some are empty. The
    goal is to fill in each cell with a number in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> – <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> subject to the following
    restrictions:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Each digit <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> –
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> must appear once
        in each row</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each digit <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> –
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> must appear once
        in each column</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each digit <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> –
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> must appear once
        in each <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\times 3$</span>
        sub-grid</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The difficulty of a Sudoku puzzle can vary widely. The
    easiest puzzles can be solved with the following two simple
    techniques:</p>
<dl class="description">
<dt>Single Value Rule:</dt>
<dd>
<p>search for squares which only have one possible value
        that can be put there.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Unique Location Rule:</dt>
<dd>
<p>within any row, column or sub-grid search for a value
        that can only be placed in one of the nine locations.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>Consider the partially solved Sudoku puzzle shown in Figure
    1. The Single Value Rule applies to grid square A<span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> is the only value that can be
    placed there. The Unique Location Rule can be used to put a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> in square
    B<span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> as it is the only
    location in row <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> where
    a <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> can be placed.</p>

<p>The easiest Sudoku puzzles can be solved with only these two
    rules; harder puzzles use techniques like swordfish, x-wings
    and BUGs.</p>
<p>For this problem you will be given a Sudoku puzzle and must
    determine if it is an easy puzzle, i.e., whether it can be
    solved by just using the Single Value and Unique Location
    rules.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single Sudoku puzzle given over nine
    lines. Each line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> values in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, where a <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> indicates a blank in the
    puzzle.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the word <tt class="tt">Easy</tt> followed by the
    solved Sudoku puzzle if it is an easy puzzle. The puzzle should
    be printed on nine lines with a single space separating values
    on a line. If the puzzle is not easy output <tt class="tt">Not
    easy</tt> followed by as much of the Sudoku puzzle as can be
    solved using the two rules described above. Use the same format
    for the partial solution as for the complete solution using a
    ‘<tt class="tt">.</tt>’ instead of a digit for a unfilled
    square.</p>
