<div class="problembody">
<p>Tom has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> objects of
    various heights, where object <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> has height <span class="tex2jax_process">$H_ i$</span>. He wants to line them up in a
    row and take a photo of them. Since he likes chaos, he wants
    the photo to look as disorderly as possible. In particular,
    given an arrangement, he will calculate the minimum difference
    in heights, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, between
    every pair of adjacent objects in the row.</p>
<p>Could you help him find the maximum possible value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>? Formally, find the
    maximum possible value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$\min
    _{1 \leq i \leq N - 1}|p_{i + 1} - p_ i|$</span>, for all
    possible permutations <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1, \dots
    , p_ N$</span> of <span class="tex2jax_process">$H_1, \dots ,
    H_ N$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of a single positive
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2 \leq N \leq 500000)$</span>.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$H_1, H_2, \dots , H_ N (1 \leq H_ i \leq
    10^9)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the maximum possible value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> as described
    above.</p>
