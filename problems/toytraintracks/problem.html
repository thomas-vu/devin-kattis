</div>Every little child, and quite a number of adults, are
    fascinated by toy trains. From a toddler’s choo-choo train to a
    hobbyist’s elaborate model railroad filling an entire basement,
    they are a profitable business. The Toy Train Tracks
    Construction Company (TTTCC) manufactures train tracks for all
    ages and skill levels. To keep their existing customers busy
    and maybe attract some new ones, the TTTCC has recently started
    publishing maps for how to connect their train tracks into
    elaborate layouts. Usually, this starts with a designer coming
    up with an interesting track layout, and then publishing both
    the layout and the required number of different track segments
    (say, curves and straight parts) needed to construct it. But
    the TTTCC has recently learned that many customers are looking
    for the reverse: they already have train track segments lying
    around (maybe found in grandma’s attic), and would like to use
    them to create a large train course. How difficult might that
    be?
    <p>To study the feasibility of automating the layout-creation
    process, TTTCC is interested in constructing train courses
    using two different shapes: straight line segments, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span>-degree turns (see
    Figure 1).</p>

<p>Valid layouts are created by placing these shapes on a
    square grid, with each track piece taking up exactly one grid
    cell. Both types of pieces can be rotated in <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span>-degree increments. A “proper”
    train track needs to be connected, and should form a single
    closed loop. Given a set of straight and curved track segments,
    what is the longest closed loop that one can construct?</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, the number of straight and curved
    track segments available, respectively (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq s \leq 10^5$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4 \leq c \leq 10^5$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a train loop using at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> straight segments and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> curved segments, that has the
    longest length (in number of track segments used) under this
    restriction. The loop must be closed and cannot intersect
    itself. If there are multiple loops of maximal length, any one
    of them will be accepted.</p>
<p>If the loop is of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, then print a single string of
    length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where the
    characters represent the loop’s segments as encountered in a
    single traversal. The character ‘<tt class="tt">S</tt>‘ stands
    for a straight-line segment, ‘<tt class="tt">L</tt>‘ for a
    curved segment that is a left turn, and ‘<tt class="tt">R</tt>’
    for a curved segment that is a right turn.</p>
