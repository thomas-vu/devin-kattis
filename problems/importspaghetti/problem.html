      </div>
</div>You just graduated from programming school and nailed a
    Python programming job. The first day at work you realize that
    you have inherited a mess. The <em>spaghetti</em> design
    pattern was chosen by the previous maintainer, who recently
    fled the country. You try to make sense of the code, but
    immediately discover that different files depend cyclically on
    each other. Testing the code, in fact running the code, has not
    yet been attempted.

    <p>As you sit down and think, you decide that the first thing
    to do is to eliminate the cycles in the dependency graph. So
    you start by finding a shortest dependency cycle.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 500$</span>, the number of files. Then follows one
    line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    distinct names of files. Each name is a string with at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> lower case letters
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>’ to ‘<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>’.
    Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    sections, one section per file name, in the order they were
    given on the second line. Each section starts with one line
    containing the name of the file and an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, followed
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines, each
    starting with “<tt class="ttfamily">import</tt>”.</p>
<p>Each “<tt class="ttfamily">import</tt>” line is a
    comma-space separated line of dependencies. No file imports the
    same file more than once, and every file imported is listed in
    the second line of the input. Comma-space separated means that
    every line will start with “<tt class="ttfamily">import</tt>”,
    then have a list of file names separated by <tt class="ttfamily">“, ”</tt> (see sample inputs for examples). Each
    import statement is followed by at least one file name.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the code base has no cyclic dependencies, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">SHIP IT</tt>”. Otherwise, output a line
    containing the names of files in a shortest cycle, in the order
    of the cycle (i.e., the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th file listed must import the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i+1)$</span>st file listed, and
    the last file listed must import the first). If there are many
    shortest cycles, any one will be accepted.</p>
