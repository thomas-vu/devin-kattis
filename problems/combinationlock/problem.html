<p>Now that youâ€™re back to school for another term, you need to
    remember how to work the combination lock on your locker. A
    common design is that of the Master Brand, shown at right. The
    lock has a dial with <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span>
    calibration marks numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$39$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> at the top and then increasing in
    clockwise order. A combination consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> of these numbers; for example:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span>-<span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span>-<span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>. To open the lock, the following
    steps are taken:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>turn the dial clockwise <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> full turns</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>stop at the first number of the combination</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>turn the dial counter-clockwise <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> full turn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>continue turning counter-clockwise until the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>nd number is
        reached</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>turn the dial clockwise again until the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>rd number is reached</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>pull the shank and the lock will open.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the initial position of the dial and the combination
    for the lock, how many degrees is the dial rotated in total
    (clockwise plus counter-clockwise) in opening the lock?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of several test cases, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\, 000$</span>. For each case there is a
    line of input containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> numbers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$39$</span>. The first number is the position
    of the dial. The next three numbers are the combination.
    Consecutive numbers in the combination will be distinct. A line
    containing four zeros follows the last case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, print a line with a single integer: the
    number of degrees that the dial must be turned to open the
    lock.</p>
