<p>You are the boss of <span class="scshape">ACM</span>
    (Apples, Cherries, and Mangos), an upstanding company with a
    single goal of world domination.</p>
<p>ACM have provided lots of fruits for the last programming
    competition for minions in Helsinki. The leftovers should now
    be shipped to Singapore. There is, however, one constraint: In
    the case that one box of apples is infested with apple-eating
    insects and the next one in the line is also a box of apples,
    the insects might move on to the neighboring box and infect it
    as well. This constraint is applicable for boxes of cherries
    and boxes of mangos too.</p>
<p>In order to avoid this, ACM decides that the boxes of fruits
    are to be sent in such a way that two consecutive boxes contain
    different types of fruits. The statistics department of ACM
    wants to know how many ways there are to arrange the shipments
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> boxes of apples,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> boxes of cherries and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> boxes of mangos under
    this constraint.</p>
<p>Please provide a computer program to compute this for
    various choices of <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>. Two arrangements are different if
    there exists <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> such that
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th box delivered
    in the two arrangements contain different types of fruits.
    Since the answer may be very big, output the answer modulo a
    prime number <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9+7$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line consisting of three
    single space separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, denoting the total number of
    boxes of apples, cherries, and mangos you need to ship to
    Singapore, respectively. All three integers will be between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$200\, 000$</span>, respectively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of different possible arrangements of
    delivery, modulo a prime number <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9+7$</span>. If there is no such order,
    output <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
