<p>You have located a major supply line that the enemy has been
    using. With satellite imaging, youâ€™ve been able to determine
    the current location and velocity of every vehicle along the
    supply line, which is for all practical purposes an infinitely
    long straight line. Furthermore, you know that each vehicle
    moves at constant velocity, and that they can pass by each
    other without incident along this supply line. What you need to
    do now is deploy an air drone with special sensors that can
    give you readings of the contents of the vehicles. The sensor
    is capable of reading everything in its range instantaneously,
    but power limitations allow it to do so only once. In order to
    minimize the required range, you want to deploy it when the
    vehicles are as close to each other as possible. Given
    knowledge of the current location and velocity of all the
    vehicles, what is the closest that the vehicles will get to
    each other?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There will be a single test case in the input. This test
    case will begin with a line with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 100\, 000$</span>) representing the number of
    vehicles. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines will have two integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-100\, 000 \le x,v \le 100\, 000$</span>),
    indicating the position (<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, in meters) and velocity
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>, in meters/hour) of
    that vehicle. The sign of velocity indicates direction.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single number equal to the minimum distance that
    will cover all of the vehicles at some time, in meters. Your
    result should have an absolute or relative error of less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span>.</p>
