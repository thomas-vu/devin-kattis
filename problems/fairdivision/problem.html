<div class="problembody">
<p>It’s your friend’s birthday, and you and some other people
    decided to buy him a copy of StarCraft II, because who wouldn’t
    want to have that?</p>
<p>You agreed to divide the costs as fairly as possible. Since
    some of you have more money available than others, you also
    agreed that nobody has to pay more than he can afford. Every
    contribution will be a multiple of 1 cent, and nobody can pay
    fractions of a cent.</p>
<p>Everybody writes down the maximum amount he is able to
    contribute. Taking into account these maximum amounts from
    everybody, you share the cost of the present as fairly as
    possible. That means, you minimize the largest distance of the
    contributions to <span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{1}{n}$</span>-th of the total cost. In
    case of a tie, minimize the second largest distance and so on.
    Since the smallest unit of contribution is 1 cent, there might
    be more than one possible division of the cost. In that case,
    persons with a higher maximum amount pay more. If there is
    still ambiguity, those who come first in the list pay more.</p>
<p>Since you bought the present, it is your task to figure out
    how much everybody has to pay (including you).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line a positive integer: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>: the price of the present in
        cents <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le p \le 1\, 000\,
        000)$</span> and the number of people <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2\le n\le 100)$</span> who contribute
        to the present (including you).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le a_ i \le 1\, 000\,
        000)$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
        i$</span> is the maximum amount, in cents, that the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th person on the
        list is able to contribute.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        integers: the amounts each person has to contribute
        according to the scheme, or “<tt class="ttfamily">IMPOSSIBLE</tt>” if the amount cannot be
        shared.</p>
</li>
