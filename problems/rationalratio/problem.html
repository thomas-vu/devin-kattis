<div class="problembody">
<p>Every (positive) rational number can be expressed as a ratio
    of two (positive) integers. However, in decimal form, rational
    numbers often have an infinitely repeating pattern, e.g.,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/7 =
    0.142857142857142857$</span>... A convenient way of writing
    this repeating pattern is to put a bar over the first
    occurrence of the repeating part, so <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/7$</span> would be
    written:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    0.\overline{142857}. \]</span>
<p>Given a rational number consisting of a series of digits,
    followed by a decimal point, followed by more digits, and then
    a number indicating how many of the rightmost digits repeat
    (i.e., the number of digits under the bar), your task is to
    find the ratio of two integers, in the most reduced form, that
    represent the same rational number. For example, for the input
    “<span class="tex2jax_process">$0.142857$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>” you should find <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/7$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will be a single line with two numbers separated
    by one space. The first number will consist of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> digits (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>), followed by a decimal point,
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span> digits (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>–<span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>), representing the decimal form of
    the number, possibly with leading zeros. The second number will
    be a positive integer indicating how many of the rightmost
    digits of the preceding number repeat. The first number will
    always be greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. The second number will never be
    less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> nor larger
    than the number of digits to the right of the decimal
    point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the corresponding fraction in its most reduced form,
    that is, the fraction with the smallest possible integer values
    in the numerator and denominator.</p>
