<p>Little Lark has a great collection of of toys. Although she
    has plenty of toys she only likes to play with one at a time.
    She decides which toy to play with by placing all the toys in a
    circle around her, numbering them <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$T-1$</span>. She then spins around in the
    clockwise direction and removes every <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>th toy until one remains. This
    means that the first toy that she removes is numbered
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K-1$</span>. If any toys are
    moved during this ritual Lark will start crying and then
    rearrange the toys in the circle in the original order.</p>
<p>Today Lark wants her father to join her while playing with
    the toys. Her father has of course a favorite toy among Larkâ€™s
    selection of toys and would of course like that specific toy to
    be chosen. At which position should he place his favorite toy
    to make sure that is the toy they end up playing with?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a single line consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> indicating the number of toys Lark
    has and the skip length she takes while selecting the next toy
    to discard.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a line with the a single integer, the position the
    father needs to place his favorite toy for it to be selected.
    Lark will start counting at position <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
