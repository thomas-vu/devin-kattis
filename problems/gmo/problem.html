<div class="problembody">
<p>A multinational company is asking you to help them
    genetically modify an apple. In order for the apples to grow
    faster, to get more of them, to make them bigger and make them
    look nicer and more symmetrical, the apple’s DNA requires an
    insertion of a certain swine gene.</p>
<p>The apple’s DNA is represented by a series of characters
    from the set <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ A, C, G, T\}
    $</span>. The required swine gene is also comprised of
    charaters from this set. The apple’s DNA should be injected
    with some characters into some places, so that the resulting
    sequence contains a swine gene somewhere (in successive
    locations). To make things a bit more complicated, inserting
    each of the characters <span class="tex2jax_process">$A, C, G,
    T$</span> has its own cost.</p>
<p>Help this multinational company in achieving their goal with
    the <em>lowest possible total cost</em>. As a reward, you get a
    ton of their apples.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 10\, 000$</span>) characters which represent the
    apple’s DNA.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains a sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le M \le 5\, 000$</span>) characters which represent the swine
    gene that we want to insert into the apple’s DNA.</p>
<p>Both the sequences are comprised only of characters from the
    set <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ A, C, G, T\}
    $</span>.</p>
<p>The third line of input contains four integers from the
    interval <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0, 1000]$</span>: the
    cost of inserting one character <span class="tex2jax_process">$A, C, G, T$</span>, in that order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the minimal
    total cost.</p>
