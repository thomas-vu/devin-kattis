<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Standard input begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \le 100$</span>, the number of test
    cases.</p>
<p>Each test case consists of two polynomials. A polynomial is
    given by an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le
    255$</span> indicating the degree of the polynomial, followed
    by a sequence of integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{0},
    a_{1}, \ldots , a_{n}$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_{i}$</span> is the coefficient of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x^{i}$</span> in the polynomial.
    All coefficients will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.</p>
<p><b class="bfseries">NB!</b> The input and output files for
    this problem are quite large, which means that you have to be a
    bit careful about I/O efficiency.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the product of the two
    polynomials, in the same format as in the input (including the
    degree). All coefficients in the result will fit in a signed
    32-bit integer.</p>
