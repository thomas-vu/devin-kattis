<div class="problembody">
<p>In this problem we deal with the calculation of stock
    prices. You need to know the following things about stock
    prices:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The <em>ask price</em> is the lowest price at which
        someone is willing to sell a share of a stock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>bid price</em> is the highest price at which
        someone is willing to buy a share of a stock.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <em>stock price</em> is the price at which the last
        deal was established.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever the bid price is greater than or equal to the ask
    price, a deal is established. A buy order offering the bid
    price is matched with a sell order demanding the ask price, and
    shares are exchanged at the rate of the ask price until either
    the sell order or the buy order (or both) is fulfilled (i.e.,
    the buyer wants no more stocks, or the seller wants to sell no
    more stocks). You will be given a list of orders (either buy or
    sell) and you have to calculate, after each order, the current
    ask price, bid price and stock price.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line a positive integer: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le n \le 1\, 000)$</span>: the
        number of orders.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines of the
        form “<em>order_type</em> <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> <tt>shares at</tt>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>”, where
        <em>order_type</em> is either “<tt>buy</tt>” or
        “<tt>sell</tt>”, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le x \le 1\,
        000$</span>) is the number of shares of a stock someone
        wishes to buy or to sell, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le y \le 1\, 000$</span>) is the
        desired price.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each of
        the form “<span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span>”, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> are the current ask, bid
        and stock prices, respectively, after the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th order has been processed
        and all possible deals have taken place. Whenever a price
        is not defined, output “<tt>-</tt>” instead of the
        price.</p>
