<p>The amazing human cannonball show is coming to town, and you
    are asked to double-check their calculations to make sure no
    one gets injured! The human cannonball is fired from a cannon
    that is a distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span>
    from a vertical wall with a hole through which the cannonball
    must fly. The lower edge of the hole is at height <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_1$</span> and the upper edge is at height
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_2$</span>. The initial
    velocity of the cannonball is given as <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_0$</span> and you also know the angle
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\theta $</span> of the cannon
    relative to the ground.</p>
<p>Thanks to their innovative suits, human cannonballs can fly
    without air resistance, and thus their trajectory can be
    modeled using the following formulas:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{eqnarray*} x(t) &amp; = &amp; v_0 t
    \cos {\theta } \\ y(t) &amp; = &amp; v_0 t \sin {\theta } -
    \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \end{eqnarray*}</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x(t), y(t)$</span>
    provides the position of a cannon ball at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> that is fired from point
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 0)$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> is the acceleration due to gravity
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$g = 9.81\ \text {m}/\text
    {s}^2$</span>).</p>
<p>Write a program to determine if the human cannonball can
    make it safely through the hole in the wall. To pass safely,
    there has to be a vertical safety margin of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> m both below and above the point
    where the ball’s trajectory crosses the centerline of the
    wall.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will consist of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> test cases. The first line
    contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>,
    denoting the number of test cases that follow. Each test case
    has <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> parameters:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_0 \ \theta \ x_1 \ h_1 \
    h_2$</span>, separated by spaces. <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_0$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; v_0 \le 200$</span>) represents the
    ball’s initial velocity in m/s. <span class="tex2jax_process">$\theta $</span> is an angle given in degrees
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; \theta &lt; 90$</span>),
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; x_1 &lt; 1000$</span>) is the
    distance from the cannon to the wall, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; h_1 &lt; h_2 &lt; 1000$</span>) are
    the heights of the lower and upper edges of the wall. All
    numbers are floating point numbers.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If the cannon ball can safely make it through the wall,
    output “<tt class="ttfamily">Safe</tt>”. Otherwise, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">Not Safe</tt>”!</p>
