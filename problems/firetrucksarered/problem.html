</div>Lily is fascinated by numbers. She believes the whole
    world revolves around them, and that everything is connected by
    numbers. Her friends, Alice, Bob, Charlie and Diane, are not
    convinced. But she gives them an example:
    <blockquote class="quote">
      Alice lives in house number 25 on her street, but that is
      exactly Bob’s age. Bob is born on June 4th, and Charlie was
      his parents’ fourth child. Finally, Diane has five fingers on
      her left hand, which happens to be the same as the number of
      toes that Bob has on his right foot!
    </blockquote>
<p>This shows that her friends are all connected—either
    directly or indirectly—by numbers. But she still has to
    convince her family as well as her coworkers.</p>
<p>Given a group of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    individuals, and a set of numbers that describe each
    individual, help Lily come up with a proof that shows that
    everyone in this group is either directly or indirectly
    connected by numbers, or determine that this is not
    possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 2\cdot 10^5$</span>), the
        number of individuals in the group. The individuals are
        numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines,
        describing the individuals in the group.</p>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th such line
        starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_
        i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m_ i \leq
        2\cdot 10^5$</span>), the number of numbers that describe
        individual <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
<p>The remainder of the line has <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_ i$</span> distinct integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_{i,1},\ldots ,d_{i,m_
        i}$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d_{i,j}
        \leq 10^9$</span> for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>), the set of numbers that
        describe individual <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is guaranteed that the sum over all <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_ i$</span> is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\cdot 10^5$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a proof in the form of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> lines, each of which contains
    three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> are distinct individuals that are
    both described by the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>. Using only these relations, it
    must be possible to show that any pair of individuals in the
    group are connected either directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>If no such proof exists, output “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”. If there are multiple proofs, you
    may output any one of them.</p>
