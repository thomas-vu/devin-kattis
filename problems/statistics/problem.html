<p>Research often involves dealing with large quantities of
    data, and those data are often too massive to examine manually.
    Statistical descriptions of data can help humans understand
    their basic properties. Consider a sample of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X=(x_1,x_2,\ldots ,x_ n)$</span>. Of many
    statistics that can be computed on <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, some of the most important are
    the following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$\min (X)$</span>: the
        smallest value in <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$\max (X)$</span>: the
        largest value in <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$\mbox{range}(X)$</span>:
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$\max (X) - \min
        (X)$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Write a program that will analyze samples of data and report
    these values for each sample.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> test cases. Each test case is
    described by one line of input, which begins with an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 30$</span> and is
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers
    which make up the sample to be analyzed. Each value in the
    sample will be in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1\,
    000\, 000$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\,
    000$</span>. Input ends at the end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, display <tt class="ttfamily">Case X:</tt>,
    where <tt class="ttfamily">X</tt> is the case number, followed
    by the min, max, and range of the sample (in that order).
    Follow the format of the sample output.</p>
