<p><b class="bfseries">THE DOCTOR</b>: Any number that reduces
    to one when you take the sum of the square of its digits and
    continue iterating it until it yields <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> is a happy number. Any number that
    doesn’t, isn’t. A <em>happy</em> prime is both happy and
    prime.</p>

<p>The number 7 is certainly prime. But is it
    happy?</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{eqnarray*} 7
    &amp; \rightarrow &amp; 7^2 = 49 \\ 49 &amp; \rightarrow &amp;
    4^2 + 9^2 = 97 \\ 97 &amp; \rightarrow &amp; 9^2 + 7^2 = 130 \\
    130 &amp; \rightarrow &amp; 1^2 + 3^2 = 10 \\ 10 &amp;
    \rightarrow &amp; 1^2 + 0^2 = 1 \\ \end{eqnarray*}</span>
<p>It is happy <tt class="ttfamily">:-)</tt> As it happens, 7
    is the smallest happy prime. Please note that for the purposes
    of this problem, 1 is <em>not</em> prime.</p>
<p>For this problem you will write a program to determine if a
    number is a happy prime.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 10\, 000$</span>), which is the
    number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be
    processed identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by the happy prime
    candidate, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>,
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le 10\,
    000$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is a single line of output. The
    single output line consists of the data set number,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single
    space followed by the candidate, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, followed by a single space,
    followed by <tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt>, indicating whether <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is a happy prime.</p>
