<p>A new type of unbounded-bandwidth wireless communication has
    just been tested and proved to be a suitable replacement for
    the existing, fiber-based communications network, which is
    struggling to keep up with traffic growth. You have been
    charged with deciding the layout of the new communications
    network. The current communications network consists of a set
    of nodes (which route messages), and links of fiber, each of
    which connects two different nodes. For each pair of nodes,
    there exists at least one way (but possibly more, for bandwidth
    purposes) to travel along the fiber between the two.</p>
<p>The new communications network will not have any fiber.
    Instead, it will have wireless links, each connecting two
    nodes. These links have unbounded bandwidth but are expensive,
    so it has been decided that as few of these links will be built
    as possible to provide connectivity; for each pair of nodes
    there should be exactly one way to travel between them along
    the wireless links. Moreover, you discovered that the nodes
    have each been built with a particular number of connections in
    mind. For each node, if it will be connected to a different
    number of links than it is today, it will have to be
    reorganized, and that is costly.</p>
<p>Your task is to design the new network so that it has
    precisely one path between each pair of nodes while minimizing
    the number of nodes that do not have the same number of
    connections as in the original network. FigureÂ 1 shows the
    original network and a solution for Sample Input 1.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with a line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 10^4$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq m \leq 10^5$</span>), denoting the number of nodes and the
    number of fiber links in the existing network. The nodes are
    numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. Each of the next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines contains two
    distinct integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span>, denoting the
    fact that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text
    {th}}$</span> fiber link connects nodes numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span>. It is guaranteed that for each
    pair of nodes there exists at least one path connecting the two
    nodes. Any pair of nodes may have more than one fiber link
    connecting them.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the smallest number of nodes for which the number of
    connected links needs to change. Starting on the next line,
    display a system of connections in the same format as the
    input. That is, display a line containing the number of nodes
    (this will be the same as in the input) and the number of
    wireless links, and then on subsequent lines descriptions of
    the links. If more than one layout is possible, any valid
    layout will be accepted.</p>
