<p>It turns out there are such things as happy numbers and
    unhappy numbers. We’re going to assume that you have been using
    these poor little lovable creatures your whole life with
    absolutely no consideration for their feelings and general
    well-being. Perhaps today we can convince you to have some
    empathy and to stop and think about whether or not your numbers
    are happy. Who ever said that a programming competition cannot
    be a lesson in numerical ethics?</p>
<p>A <em>happy number</em> is a positive integer that, when
    repeatedly replaced with the sum of the squares of its digits,
    eventually reaches the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Alternatively, if this process
    repeats endlessly, the number is <em>unhappy</em>.</p>
<p>Slightly more formally (taken from Wikipedia), given a
    positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n =
    n_{0}$</span>, define a sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_{0}, n_{1}, n_{2}, \ldots $</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_{j+1}$</span> is the sum of
    the squares of the <span class="mbox" style="width:">base-<span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span></span>
    digits of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_{j}$</span>, for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j \geq 0$</span>. Then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is happy if and only
    if there exists <span class="tex2jax_process">$i \geq 0$</span>
    such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_{i} = 1$</span>;
    otherwise, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is
    unhappy.</p>
<p>If you are still confused, take a look at the process for
    the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$19$</span>,
    which is happy:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 1^{2} +
    9^{2} = 82 \]</span><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 8^{2} +
    2^{2} = 68 \]</span><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 6^{2} +
    8^{2} = 100 \]</span><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 1^{2} +
    0^{2} + 0^{2} = 1 \]</span>
<p>Given two positive integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (with <span class="tex2jax_process">$A \leq B$</span>), your challenge is to
    determine how many happy numbers there are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (inclusive).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 10\, 000$</span>), the number
    of test cases. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines, one per test case. Each
    test case is specified by two space-separated integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq A \leq B \leq 10^{6}$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the
    number of happy numbers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, inclusive.</p>
