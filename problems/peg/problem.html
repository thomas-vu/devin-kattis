<p>In the famous logic game Peg, pieces jump over other pieces
    to remove them from the game, until only one piece is left.</p>
<p>Here is the initial layout of the board:</p>
<center>
<pre>
  ooo  
  ooo  
ooooooo
ooo.ooo
ooooooo
  ooo  
  ooo  
</pre>
</center>
<p>The lowercase letter ’<tt class="ttfamily">o</tt>’
    represents a piece, while the character ’<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’ is an empty square. In one move, a player
    may choose one piece and one of the four main directions (up,
    down, left, right), if there is another piece in that
    direction, and an empty square behind it. The chosen piece
    jumps over the other piece and settles in the empty square
    behind it, while the piece being jumped over is removed from
    the game.</p>
<p>Write a program that calculates the number of legal moves,
    given the state of the board.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The board is represented by seven lines containing seven
    characters each. The first two and last two characters on the
    first two and last two lines are always spaces, and all
    remaining characters are either ’<tt class="ttfamily">o</tt>’
    (lowercase letter) or ’<tt class="ttfamily">.</tt>’ (period
    character).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of legal moves.</p>
