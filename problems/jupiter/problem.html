<p>Although we imagine interplanetary probes to be very
    sophisticated pieces of technology, their information systems
    are quite archaic. You might assume that they have a certain
    amount of contiguous main memory and can store their data
    wherever is convenient, but unfortunately that is not the case.
    The probe’s main memory is organised in a number of FIFO
    (first-in-first-out) queues. In such a queue, data has to be
    taken out of the queue in the same order as it has been added
    to it.</p>
<p>A probe has multiple sensors and each sensor is linked to
    one of the queues. Whenever a sensor finishes recording, it
    appends the generated data to its queue. A sensor can write
    data to the queue only if the queue has enough space left to
    take all the data; if not, the data is lost.</p>
<p>In order to transfer data from the probe to Earth (in a
    process called <em>downlinking</em>), the path between the
    satellite and Earth must not be blocked by anything
    (e.g. a planet like Jupiter) and the antenna must be
    correctly positioned. During each downlink opportunity, data
    can be taken from multiple queues and transmitted back to
    Earth. The total amount of data that can be transmitted during
    a downlink opportunity depends on the length of the downlink
    opportunity and distance to Earth. Sensors do not collect data
    during downlink opportunities, since all electricity available
    is devoted to the transmitter.</p>
<p>The most important thing for scientists is not to lose any
    data recorded by sensors. In particular, all queues have to be
    empty after the last downlink opportunity. The scientists have
    asked you to write a program to determine whether all data can
    be transferred to Earth in a given time frame.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line containing three positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n,q,s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n,q \leq 30$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s \leq 100$</span>), the number
        of downlink windows, FIFO queues, and sensors,
        respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$q_1 \ldots q_
        s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq q_ i \leq
        q$</span> for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>), determining for each sensor
        the queue it feeds its data into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1 \ldots c_
        q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq c_ i \leq
        10^6$</span> for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>), determining for each queue
        the size of the queue in megabytes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        describing one downlink window. Each contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$s + 1$</span> non-negative integers.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d \leq 10^6$</span>) states
            the number of megabytes that can be transferred to
            earth during the window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1 \ldots a_ s$</span>
            (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a_ i \leq
            10^6$</span> for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>) describing the amount of
            data (in megabytes) generated by each of the sensors
            after the last but before this downlink window.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There will never be new data during a downlink window.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “<tt class="ttfamily">possible</tt>” if it is
    possible to transfer all data to Earth, and “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>” otherwise.</p>
