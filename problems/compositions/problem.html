<div class="problembody">
<p>A <i class="itshape">composition</i> of an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is an ordered set of
    integers which sum to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.
    Two <i class="itshape">compositions</i> with the same elements
    but in different orders are considered different (this
    distinguishes <i class="itshape">compositions</i> from
    partitions). For example, all the <i class="itshape">compositions</i> of the first few integers are:</p>
<pre>
1: {1}
2: {1+1, 2}
3: {1+1+1, 1+2, 2+1, 3}
4: {1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 1+2+1, 1+3, 2+1+1, 2+2, 3+1, 4}
</pre>
<p>Note that <tt class="ttfamily">1+2</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">2+1</tt> each count as distinct <i class="itshape">compositions</i> of <tt class="ttfamily">3</tt>. As
    you may have suspected, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{(n-1)}$</span> <i class="itshape">compositions</i> of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<p>In this problem, we set conditions on the elements of the
    <i class="itshape">compositions</i> of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. A <i class="itshape">composition</i> misses a set <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> if no element of the <i class="itshape">composition</i> is in the set <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>. For example, the <i class="itshape">compositions</i> of the first few integers which miss
    the set of even integers are:</p>
<pre>
1: {1}
2: {1+1}
3: {1+1+1, 3}
4: {1+1+1+1, 1+3, 3+1}
</pre>
<p>No odd integer can have a <i class="itshape">composition</i>
    missing the set of odd integers and any <i class="itshape">composition</i> of an even integer consisting of only
    even integers must be <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    times a <i class="itshape">composition</i> of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n/2$</span>.</p>
<p>For this problem you will write a program to compute the
    number of <i class="itshape">compositions</i> of an input
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> which miss the
    elements of the arithmetic sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ m + i \cdot k \ | \ i = 0,1,\ldots \}
    $</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single decimal integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 60$</span>), which is the number
    of data sets that follow. Each data set should be processed
    identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by the three space
    separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 30$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le m &lt; k &lt; 30$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is one line of output. The single
    output line consists of the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single space
    followed by the number of <i class="itshape">compositions</i>
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> which miss the
    specified sequence.</p>
