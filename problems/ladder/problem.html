<div class="problembody">
<p>You are attempting to climb up the roof to fix some leaks,
    and have to go buy a ladder. The ladder needs to reach to the
    top of the wall, which is <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> centimeters high, and in order to
    be steady enough for you to climb it, the ladder can be at an
    angle of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>
    degrees from the ground. How long does the ladder have to
    be?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>, with meanings as described above.
    You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le h \le
    10000$</span> and that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le v
    \le 89$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Write a single line containing the minimum possible length
    of the ladder in centimeters, rounded <em>up</em> to the
    nearest integer.</p>
