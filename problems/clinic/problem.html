<div class="problembody">
<p>You work at a clinic. The clinic factors in the waiting time
    when selecting patients to treat next. This approach was
    adopted to prevent patients from having to wait too long before
    being treated. Your task is to help the clinic perform
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> types of queries:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Process a patient arrival to the clinic. The patient
        will have an arrival time <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, a name <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, and a severity <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> that is accessed automatically
        by scanners at the entrance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At time <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the
        doctor is ready to treat a patient. Every time this
        happens, the clinic will calculate priority values for
        every patient waiting in the clinic, and the patient with
        the highest priority value will be treated first. The
        priority value is computed as the following
        sum</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ S + K \cdot W
        \]</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is the
        severity value of the patient, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> is the constant that the
        clinic uses, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>
        is the total time the patient has been waiting in the
        clinic. If there are multiple patients with that value, the
        patient with the lexicographically smallest name is treated
        next. Your program will announce the name of that
        patient.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>At time <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the
        clinic receives a notification stating that, due to
        unfortunate circumstances, a patient with name <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> has left the queue
        permanently. If no patient with name <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> exists in the queue, it is
        always a false alarm and will be ignored by the clinic.
        Otherwise, the notification is guaranteed to be valid and
        should be processed accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 200\, 000$</span>, the number
    of queries to be processed, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq K \leq 10\, 000\, 000$</span>, the
    constant for the clinic. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines follow, each line beginning
    with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> = <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q
    = 1$</span> denotes a query of the first type and will be
    followed by an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> and an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q
    = 2$</span> denotes a query of the second type and will be
    followed by an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q
    = 3$</span> denotes a query of the third type and will be
    followed by an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    and a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>. For all
    queries, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq T,S \leq 10\,
    000\, 000$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    values are strictly increasing. <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> is a non-empty alphanumeric string
    containing no spaces, and contains at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> characters. All patients have
    unique names. There is at least one query of the second
    type.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query of the second type, output the name of the
    patient who will be treated on a new line. If the clinic is
    empty, print the string “doctor takes a break” (without quotes)
    on a new line instead.</p>
<h2>Subtasks</h2>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">(28 Points)</b>: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10,000$</span>. There is
        no query of type <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>.
        You can assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$K =
        0$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b class="bfseries">(32 Points)</b>: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10,000$</span>. There is
        no query of type <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>.</p>
