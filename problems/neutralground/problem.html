<p>Two kingdoms had been at war for a long time, until the
    emperor intervened to bring an end to the conflict. The
    territory in question comprises an <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> rectangular grid. At the emperor’s
    insistence, the two kings have withdrawn their troops until no
    two opposing troops are in adjacent squares of the map
    (adjacent being horizontal or vertical – diagonal is not
    considered).</p>
<p>The emperor proposes to designate certain squares of the map
    as neutral territory. Neither king will be allowed to move
    troops into those squares, and the emperor’s own forces will
    patrol them to be sure that both kings observe these rules.</p>
<p>The emperor is frugal and does not want to commit more
    soldiers to this effort than absolutely necessary. His generals
    have marked each square of the map with the number of soldiers
    required to secure that square. What remains is to choose which
    of those squares should be patrolled.</p>
<p>Write a program to determine the minimum number of soldiers
    that the emperor will need to be deploy to guarantee that the
    troops of one kingdom cannot move, in one or more steps, into
    squares occupied by the troops of the second kingdom (moving
    horizontally or vertically) without encountering the emperor’s
    own soldiers.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>, denoting the width and height of
    the map, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq w, h \leq
    40$</span>.</p>
<p>This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>
    lines. Each line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> characters, left justified. These
    characters will be ‘A’ or ‘B’, designating a position held by
    king A or king B, or a single numeric digit, designating a
    currently unoccupied position that can be secured by the use of
    that number of soldiers. For example, a ‘2’ would indicate that
    two soldiers must be deployed to that square to secure it
    against passage of other troops. A ‘0’ indicates terrain that
    is impassible – the emperor need not commit soldiers there
    because the kingdom troops cannot pass through that square.</p>
<p>No ‘A’ will be adjacent, horizontally or vertically, to any
    ‘B’.</p>
<p>There will be at least one ‘A’ and one ‘B’ in the input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print a single line containing an integer denoting the
    minimum number of soldiers that the emperor must deploy to
    guarantee that there is no open path between any ‘A’ position
    and any ‘B’ position, using any combination of horizontal or
    vertical moves.</p>
