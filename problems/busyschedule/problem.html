<div class="problembody">
<p>You have a busy schedule to keep up with. Every time you
    make a new appointment, you scribble the starting time down on
    a little note pad. At the start of every day (12:00 a.m.), you
    sort the appointments for that day from earliest to latest and
    then go to sleep. Instead of having to be up at midnight every
    night to sort your appointments, you decide this would be a
    good job for your computer.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> test cases. Each test case
    describes the appointments for a single day, starting with a
    line containing the number of appointments <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100$</span>. Following this
    are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
    containing one appointment time. Each appointment time has the
    format <tt class="tt">H:M Z</tt> where <tt class="tt">H</tt> is
    an integer in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1,
    12]$</span> representing the hour, <tt class="tt">M</tt> is a
    zero-padded two-digit integer in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[00, 59]$</span> representing the minute,
    and and <tt class="tt">Z</tt> is either ‘<tt class="tt">a.m.</tt>’ or ‘<tt class="tt">p.m.</tt>’ representing
    times before or after mid-day, respectively. The sequence of
    test cases ends with a value of zero for <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the sequence of event starting
    times sorted from earliest to latest in the day, one per line.
    Format times in the same way as the input. Separate adjacent
    test case outputs with a blank line.</p>
