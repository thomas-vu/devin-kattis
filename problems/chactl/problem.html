<p>Seasoned competitive programmers are quite familiar with
    <a href="https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl"><span class="scshape">
    KACTL</span></a>, a very good algorithm repository designed for
    use in the ICPC. The problem setters of Chalmers Challenge 2021
    count themselves to this group, but have in preparation for
    this contest noticed two serious flaws with it.</p>
<p>First, it turns out the <span class="scshape">K</span> in
    <span class="scshape">KACTL</span> stands for <span class="scshape">KTH</span>! This is clearly unacceptable and needs to
    be remedied. Second, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span>-page limit prevents the
    repository from achieving true greatness. Hence, we introduce
    <span class="scshape">CHACTL</span>: Chalmers Competition
    Template Library with no less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{26}$</span> pages. This is plenty space
    for all distributed quadratic SIMD, assault and battery of
    floating-point numbers and cryptic guides to crossword solving
    you could ever wish for!</p>
<p>During development, Dragos came up to us and said that our
    users need a proper navigation system to handle the scale and
    intensity of <span class="scshape">CHACTL</span>. He
    recommended buttons that traverse the pages a power of two at a
    time. We implemented this, so from page <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> you can go to page <span class="tex2jax_process">$i + 2^ t$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$i - 2^ t$</span> in a single step for any
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>.</p>
<p>Although there are no pages with negative numbers, or with
    arbitrarily large numbers, the navigation system supports
    jumping to such pages as it might reduce the number of jumps
    needed.</p>
<p>We want to test this by looking up algorithms on pages
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_0, P_1, \ldots
    P_{N-1}$</span>, in that order. <span class="scshape">CHACTL</span>â€™s pages are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{26} - 1$</span>. Starting from page
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, what is the smallest
    number of jumps required to look up all the algorithms?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 10^5$</span>. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each contain one integer.
    Line <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le P_ i &lt; 2^{26}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the smallest number of jumps required to look up the
    algorithms.</p>
