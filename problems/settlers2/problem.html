<p>The popular board game “Settlers of Catan” starts by
    creating a random board. This board consists of hexagonal
    resource tiles containing five different resources: clay,
    lumber, wool, grain, and ore. For simplicity, we will denote
    these by the numbers 1 to 5.</p>
<p>Random boards, however, often have multiple equal resource
    tiles next to each other. This annoys some players. Therefore,
    we have invented a new way of creating the playing board.
    Starting in the middle and spiraling outwards, each time we add
    a new tile to the board we choose the resource of the tile
    according to the following rules:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>the new tile must be different from its neighboring
        tiles on the board so far;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in case multiple tiles are possible, we choose a
        resource that occurs the least number of times on the board
        so far;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in case multiple tiles are still possible, the new
        resource must have the lowest number possible.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The figure underneath shows how to spiral outwards and which
    resource tiles are chosen first. We are curious what the number
    of the resource is on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>th tile that is added to the board
    (starting with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=1$</span>).</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line of the input there is one integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le c \le 200)$</span>, the number of
    test cases. Each following test case consists of a single line
    with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le n \le 10\, 000)$</span>,
    the number of the tile we are curious about.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print a single line with one integer,
    specifying the resource of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>th tile.</p>
