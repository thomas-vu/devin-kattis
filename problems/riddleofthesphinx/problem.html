        Oedipus and the Sphinx by Gustave Moreau, 1864, public
        domain
      </div>
</div>One of the most remarkable landmarks in Egypt is the
    Great Sphinx of Giza, a statue depicting a mythical creature
    with the head of a human, the body of a lion, and the wings of
    an eagle. Sphinxes were regarded as guardians in Egyptian and
    Greek mythologies. Probably the most famous sphinx is the one
    who guarded the Greek city of Thebes. According to myths, when
    Oedipus tried to enter the city, the sphinx gave him the
    following riddle: “Which creature has one voice, but has four
    feet in the morning, two feet in the afternoon, and three feet
    at night?” As you might have heard, Oedipus correctly answered,
    “Man — who crawls on all fours as a baby, then walks on two
    feet as an adult, and then uses a walking stick in old age.”
    <p>In this problem, you meet a different sphinx who gives you a
    somewhat reversed riddle: “How many legs do an axex, a
    basilisk, and a centaur have?” While you recognize these as
    creatures from Egyptian and Greek mythology, you have no clue
    how many legs each has (except that it is a nonnegative
    integer). The sphinx sternly instructs you to not touch
    anything so you are unable to search for the answer on your
    phone.</p>
<p>However, the sphinx allows you to ask her five questions. In
    each question you can ask the sphinx how many legs some number
    of these creatures have in total. For instance, you could ask,
    “How many legs do three basilisks and one axex have in total?”
    or “How many legs do five centaurs have?” Seems easy enough,
    you think, but then you remember that sphinxes are tricky
    creatures: one of the sphinx’s five answers might be an
    outright lie, and you do not know which one.</p>
<p>Write a program to talk to the sphinx, ask the five
    questions, and solve the riddle.</p>
<h2>Interaction</h2>
<p>There are exactly five rounds of questions. In each question
    round, you must first write a line containing three
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le a, b, c \le 10$</span>), representing the question “How
    many legs do <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> axex,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> basilisks, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> centaurs have in
    total?” After the question is asked, an input line containing a
    single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le r \le 10^5$</span>) is
    available on standard input, giving the sphinx’s answer to your
    question.</p>
<p>After the five rounds of questions, output a line containing
    three space-separated nonnegative integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell _ a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell _ b$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell _ c$</span>, indicating the number of
    legs of an axex, a basilisk, and a centaur, respectively.</p>
