<p>You have invented a new form of the game of darts, and it is
    based on the idea that the tightest cluster of darts wins — but
    they don’t necessarily have to be close to a target. In fact,
    the game is easy to play because it doesn’t require a target;
    players can just throw darts against a wall (preferably one
    that you don’t care about). When a player is done throwing
    their <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> darts, they wrap
    a string tightly around the outside of all the outermost darts,
    so that the string encompasses all of the thrown darts. If
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is the length of the
    string needed to enclose the darts, then the score for that
    player’s darts is <span class="tex2jax_process">$100 \cdot n /
    (1 + s)$</span>.</p>
<p>Now you need a program to determine the score of different
    dart configurations.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> player turns, one turn per line.
    Each player’s turn has a list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> pairs of real numbers with at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> digits past the
    decimal, which are the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,
    y)$</span> locations where the dart has landed. The bounds are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-30 \le x, y \le 30$</span>.
    Input ends at the end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each turn, print the score obtained, with at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.0001$</span> error.</p>
