<div class="problembody">
<p>You recently discovered there is treasure buried on your
    farm land. A <b class="bf">lot</b> of treasure! You quickly
    decide to put a fence around the land.</p>
<p>Alas, you have but a single fence post! You will have to
    drive to town to get more fencing material. But you canâ€™t just
    leave the land as open as it is, so you decide to create a
    makeshift fence to protect some of the treasure while you are
    gone. You will place the post in the ground and run some wire
    in a straight line between two sides of your barn wall and the
    fence post to section off a triangular area. Also, the ground
    is very hard: only places that were dug up to bury a treasure
    are soft enough for you to quickly place the fence post.</p>
<p>To figure out the best option, you first calculate the
    following. For each of the treasures in your field, if you were
    to place the fence post at that treasure and complete the fence
    as described, then what is the total value of all treasures
    that would be enclosed by the fence? Note that the treasure
    under the post you place is not considered enclosed by the
    fence (it might not be safe since someone could dig around the
    post).</p>
<p>Sample Input 1 is illustrated below. The triangle that
    includes the point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(-1,10)$</span> encloses exactly two other
    treasure points which have total value <span class="tex2jax_process">$4+8=12$</span>.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 10^5$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq x \leq 10^9$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of treasure points
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> fixes the two
    corners of the barn wall at locations <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,0)$</span>.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^9 \leq x \leq 10^9$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq y \leq 10^9$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq v \leq 10^9$</span>) giving the
    location <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> and value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> of one of the treasure
    points. All of these points are distinct. It is also guaranteed
    that for each point, the triangle formed with the barn wall
    will not contain any other treasure point on its boundary.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, one
    for each treasure point in the order of the input. For each
    point output a single integer, which is the total value of all
    points in the interior of the triangle that point forms with
    the barn wall. Note that the value of the point itself should
    be excluded from this sum.</p>
