<p>When someone asks you what time it is, most people respond
    “a quarter past five”, <tt class="ttfamily">15:29</tt> or
    something similar. If you want to make things a bit harder, you
    can answer with the angle from the minute hand to the hour
    hand, since this uniquely determines the time. However, most
    people are not used to this way of specifying the time, so it
    would be nice to have a program which translates this to a more
    common format. Your task is to write such a program.</p>

<p>We assume that our clock has no second hand, and only
    displays the time at whole minutes (i.e., both hands only move
    forward once a minute). The angle is determined by starting at
    the hour hand and measuring the number of degrees clockwise to
    the minute hand. To avoid decimals, this angle is specified in
    tenths of a degree (so that <span class="tex2jax_process">$85.5$</span> degrees is written as
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$855$</span>). This number is
    always an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3595$</span> (inclusive) and is, as a
    consequence of only measuring whole minutes, evenly divisible
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$3595$</span> – the angle between the two
    hands, in tenths of a degree.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the time that the angle corresponds to, in the format
    <tt class="ttfamily">hh:mm</tt>. We assume that it’s morning,
    so all times should be between <tt class="ttfamily">00:00</tt>
    and <tt class="ttfamily">11:59</tt>.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>Your solution will be tested on three cases. The first two
    give you <span class="tex2jax_process">$33$</span> points each,
    while the last gives you <span class="tex2jax_process">$34$</span>.</p>
