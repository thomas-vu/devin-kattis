<div class="description"></div>
</div>You are competing in a ski slalom, and you need to select
    the best skis for the race. The format of the race is that
    there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> pairs of
    left and right gates, where each right gate is <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> metres to the right of its
    corresponding left gate, and you may neither pass to the left
    of the left gate nor to the right of the right gate. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th pair of gates
    occurs at distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_{i}$</span>
    down the hill, with the horizontal position of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; left gate
    given by <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{i}$</span>. Each
    gate is further down the hill than the previous gate (i.e.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_{i}$</span> &lt; <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_{i+1}$</span> for all <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>).

    <p>You may select from <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>
    pairs of skis, where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th pair has speed <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_{j}$</span>. Your movement is governed by
    the following rule: if you select a pair of skis with speed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_{j}$</span>, you move with a
    constant downward velocity of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_{j}$</span> metres per second.
    Additionally, at any time you may move at a horizontal speed of
    at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_{h}$</span> metres per
    second.</p>
<p>You may start and finish at any two horizontal positions.
    Determine which pair of skis will allow you to get through the
    race course, passing through all the gates, in the shortest
    amount of time.</p>
<h2>Input Specification</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$v_{h}$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, separated by spaces, with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 &lt;= W &lt;= 10^8$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq v_{h} \leq 10^6$</span>,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq
    10^5$</span>.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    of input each contain two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_{i}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_{i}$</span>, the horizontal and vertical
    positions respectively of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th left gate, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x_{i},\, y_{i} \leq 10^8$</span>.</p>
<p>The next line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>, the number of skis, with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq S \leq 10^6$</span>.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> lines
    of input each contain one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_{j}$</span>, the speed of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th pair of skis, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s_{j} \leq 10^6$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output Specification</h2>
<p>If it is impossible to complete the race with any pair of
    skis, print the line <tt class="ttfamily">IMPOSSIBLE</tt>.
    Otherwise, print the vertical speed <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_{j}$</span> of the pair of skis that
    allows you to get through the race course in the shortest
    time.</p>
