        a treasure map
      </div>
</div>
<p>Buried treasure can be found using treasure maps. There are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> different locations
    numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>. Each location
    contains either treasure or a trap.</p>
<p>Joey gives you <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    treasure maps. Each treasure map has two markers <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_1, m_2$</span>. For <span class="tex2jax_process">$i\in \{ 1,2\} $</span>, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_ i &lt; 0$</span>, then the map is
    claiming that location <span class="tex2jax_process">$|m_
    i|$</span> contains a trap. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_ i &gt; 0$</span>, then the map is
    claiming that location <span class="tex2jax_process">$|m_
    i|$</span> contains treasure.</p>
<p>We say that a treasure map is <i class="itshape">reasonable</i> if at least one of the claims it makes
    is correct. For example, if a map claims that location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> contains treasure and
    location <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> contains a
    trap, while in reality location <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> contains a trap and location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> contains treasure,
    then the map is <i class="itshape">not</i> reasonable.</p>
<p>Joey asserts that every treasure map that he has given you
    is reasonable. Can you check whether this is possible, i.e.
    whether there exists an assignment of locations <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> to either treasure or trap such
    that each map makes at least one correct claim?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number
    of treasure maps you have, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, the number of possible locations
    on the treasure maps (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n
    \leq 10^{5}, 1 \leq m \leq 10^{5}$</span>).</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines of
    input each contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    integers. For <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq j \leq
    n$</span>, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{th}$</span>
    line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_1,
    m_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-m \leq m_1, m_2
    \leq m$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_1, m_2
    \neq 0$</span>) which represent the two locations marked by map
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If itâ€™s possible for every map to be reasonable, print YES.
    Otherwise, print NO.</p>
<h2>Sample Explanation</h2>
<p>In Sample Input <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>,
    there is no assignment of locations to either treasure or trap
    to make all maps reasonable. If for example we say that
    location <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> both contain treasure,
    then map <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> will not be
    reasonable, while if we say that location <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> contains a trap and location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> contains treasure,
    then map <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> will not be
    reasonable. The other cases are similar.</p>
<p>In Sample Input <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, if
    location <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> contains a
    trap and location <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    contains treasure, then all <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> maps will be reasonable.</p>
