<p>After staying up all night, Yraglac has finally finished
    writing the essay for his assignment. However, he just noticed
    at the last minute that his essay exceeds the maximum
    permissible length!</p>
<p>Since Yraglac has little time left, he doesn’t want to spend
    too much time changing his essay. At the same time, he doesn’t
    want to change the meaning of his essay. He came up with a
    genius plan for solving his predicament: he will replace every
    word with the shortest possible synonym!</p>
<p>The essay consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> words. There can be repeated words
    in the essay, and some of the words in the essay may not have
    any synonyms. The thesaurus consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> different word pairs, where a word
    pair <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a, b)$</span> denotes that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is a synonym of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and vice versa. Note
    that synonyms are transitive, so if <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is a synonym of <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> is a synonym of <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is a synonym of <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>.</p>
<p>What is the minimum number of characters (excluding spaces)
    in the essay assuming every word is replaced with the shortest
    possible synonym?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N, M$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N, M\leq 5\, 000$</span>.</p>
<p>The next line of the input represents the essay, which
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    space-separated strings.</p>
<p>The remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines
    of the input represents the thesaurus. Each line contains two
    space-separated strings <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, denoting that they are
    synonyms.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that no string in the input contains more
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> characters
    and that all strings consists of only lowercase English
    characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer denoting the minimum number of
    characters in the essay excluding spaces if every word is
    replaced with the shortest possible synonym.</p>
