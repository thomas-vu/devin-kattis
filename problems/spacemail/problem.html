<p>You are a space postal carrier. Your job is to deliver
    parcels in your spaceship to every planet in your postal
    district. The number of parcels you can deliver depends on how
    much fuel you need to carry in your ship in order to jump from
    planet to planet while on your delivery route. The less fuel
    you need to carry, the smaller your fuel tank can be, leaving
    room for more parcels and ultimately making you richer. Note
    that you can fill up your tank before each planet-to-planet
    jump if you want. And since you work for the United Federation
    of Planets Postal Service, time and the amount of fuel used are
    irrelevant. (It does not matter how many jumps you make as long
    the parcels get delivered.)</p>
<p>Given a star map, you must figure out the smallest possible
    fuel tank to install in your ship in order for you to deliver
    to all the planets. The amount of fuel required to make a jump
    between two planets (in litres of plasma fuel) is numerically
    equal to the distance between the two planets (in light years).
    For example, a distance of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2.718$</span> light years requires
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2.718$</span> litres of
    fuel. It is important, though, that the size of a fuel tank is
    always an integer value, so for that particular distance you
    would need a <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-litre</span> fuel tank or
    larger.</p>
<p>Write a program that reads in the locations of all the
    planets and determines the smallest possible fuel tank you
    should install in your ship. You can begin your delivery route
    on any planet, but wherever you begin, you must be able to
    visit all the planets (possibly revisiting planets along the
    way).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of planets in your
    postal district <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 5\, 000$</span>)</span>. This
    is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines,
    each of which contains three space-separated integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span>, the cartesian coordinates of one
    planet <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x,y,z \leq 1\, 000$</span>)</span>.
    No two planets share the same coordinates.</p>
<p>Recall that if planet <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> is at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1,y_1,z_1)$</span> and planet
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> is at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2,y_2,z_2)$</span>, then the distance
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> is</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2 + (z_1
    - z_2)^2} \]</span>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the size of the smallest fuel tank
    your ship will need.</p>
