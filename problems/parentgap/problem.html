<p>In North America, and in many countries around the world,
    Mother’s Day is celebrated on the second Sunday in May, and
    Father’s Day is celebrated on the third Sunday in June. The
    interval between Mother’s Day and Father’s Day in any
    particular year, sometimes referred to as the <em>parent
    gap</em>, is always either <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> weeks or <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> weeks. For example, in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2022$</span> Mother’s Day was on
    May <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> and Father’s
    Day was on June <span class="tex2jax_process">$19$</span>,
    a parent gap of <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> weeks, but in <span class="tex2jax_process">$2023$</span> Mother’s Day will be on
    May <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span> and Father’s
    Day will be on June <span class="tex2jax_process">$18$</span>, a parent gap of only
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> weeks.</p>
<p>Your task is to determine the parent gap for a given year.
    The following information may be helpful. In a year that is not
    a leap year, the months have the following number of days:
    January: <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span>,
    February: <span class="tex2jax_process">$28$</span>,
    March: <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span>,
    April: <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span>,
    May: <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span>,
    June: <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span>,
    July: <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span>,
    August: <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span>,
    September: <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span>,
    October: <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span>,
    November: <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span>,
    December: <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span>. In a
    leap year, February has an extra day (February <span class="tex2jax_process">$29^{\textrm{th}}$</span>), and the Leap Year
    Rule is as follow: a year that is divisible
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> is a leap
    year, unless it is divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, with the exception (to the
    exception) that a year that is divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$400$</span> <em>is</em> a leap year.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single year, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2\, 000 \leq y \leq 3\, 000)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the parent gap for the input year, either “<tt class="ttfamily">5 weeks</tt>” or “<tt class="ttfamily">6 weeks</tt>”.</p>
