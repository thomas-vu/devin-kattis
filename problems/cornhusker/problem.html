<p>Corn farmers need to do pre-harvest yield estimates to
    determine the approximate number of bushels of corn their farm
    will produce. They do this to determine if they have enough
    storage space (grain bins) to store the harvested crop or if
    they’ll have to store the corn elsewhere, like a co-op (which
    costs $$$). They also use these estimates when negotiating the
    future market prices of their corn. Estimates are typically
    done about a month or two before harvest. By this time, the
    ears have formed and the kernels on the ears are mostly
    developed (this makes counting the kernels easier).</p>
<p>According to the <em>University of Nebraska-Lincoln</em>,
    <em>Nebraska Extension for Educators</em>, the standard way to
    estimate corn yield is to calculate the number of bushels of
    corn per acre. To make the calculations easier, they use an
    area of 1/1000th of an acre, which, with 30” row spacing, is a
    section of one row about 17’5” long. Within that 17’5”, five
    ears are chosen at random. For each ear, the number of kernels
    are counted by multiplying the number of rows of kernels around
    by the number of kernels over the length of the ear. The totals
    for each of the five ears are added together and then divided
    by five to determine the average number of kernels per ear of
    corn. This number is then multiplied by the total number of
    ears of corn in the 17’5” section of row. This gives you the
    total number of kernels in 1/1000th of an acre. This number is
    then divided by the <em>Kernel Weight Factor</em>
    (<em>KWF</em>). The <em>KWF</em> is a function of how wet (or
    dry) the growing season is and is typically a value between 75
    (wet) and 95 (dry). The resulting quotient is the number of
    bushels/acre the farmer can expect to harvest.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that the average number of kernels per
    ear is 512 (16 kernels around by 32 kernels lengthwise), and
    there are 25 ears in the 17’5” of row with a <em>KWF</em> of
    85. The farmer could then expect:</p>
<center>
<big class="xxlarge"><span class="tex2jax_process">$\frac{25\times 512}{85}\ = \ 150\
      bushels$</span></big>
</center>
<p>Since farmers are quite conservative in their estimates, all
    calculations are done as integers with no rounding.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of two lines. The first line contains 10
    space separated integer values representing the number of
    kernels around (<em>A</em>) and number of kernels long
    (<em>L</em>) for each of five ears of corn (<span class="tex2jax_process">$8 \leq A \leq 24$</span>), (<span class="tex2jax_process">$20 \leq L \leq 50$</span>).</p>
<p>The second line contains 2 space separated integer values
    representing the number of ears of corn, <em>N</em>, in the
    17’5” row (<span class="tex2jax_process">$10 \leq N \leq
    50$</span>) and the <em>KWF</em> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$75 \leq KWF \leq 95$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer equal to the estimated number of
    bushels of corn per acre the farmer can expect given the input
    supplied.<br/></p>
