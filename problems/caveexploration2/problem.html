<p>It is monsoon season, and your goldfish Orange is stuck at
    the bottom of a cave system in Thailand. Every hour, the water
    rises by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> meter.
    Thankfully, Orange has the ability to swim instantaneously from
    one location to another. However, he can’t hop over the sharp
    rocks in the way.</p>
<p>You trust that Orange is smart and will find the way out of
    the cave as soon as possible. To prepare Orange’s meal, you
    want to write a program to find out how long it will take for
    Orange to come back home.</p>
<p>You are given the cave system as an <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \times N$</span> grid where each location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i, j)$</span> contains a
    nonnegative integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_{i,
    j}$</span>, representing the height of the rocks in meters at
    that location. Orange can only swim left, right, up, or down
    from one submerged location to another submerged location (but
    not diagonally).</p>
<p>A location <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i, j)$</span> is
    submerged if the water level is at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> meter higher than <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_{i, j}$</span>. Orange’s starting location
    will always be at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,
    0)$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_{0, 0} =
    0$</span>. The initial water level is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> meter so that Orange’s start
    location is submerged. The only exit in the cave is at location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(N - 1, N - 1)$</span>. After
    how many hours can Orange find his way to the exit?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, on the first line such that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 100$</span>,
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers each,
    separated by spaces, such that each integer represents the
    height <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_{i, j}$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le h_{i, j} \le
    10^8$</span>) of the rocks at location <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i, j)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the minimum number of
    hours that must pass before Orange can reach the exit.</p>
