<p>Imagine you are in the hiring process for a company whose
    principal activity is the analysis of information in the Web.
    One of the tests consists in writing a program for maintaining
    up to date a set of trending topics. You will be hired
    depending on the efficiency of your solution.</p>
<p>They provide you with text from the most active blogs. The
    text is organised daily and you have to provide the sorted list
    of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> most frequent
    words during the last 7 days, when asked.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input file contains one test case. The text
    corresponding to a day is delimited by tag
    <tt>&lt;text&gt;</tt>. Queries of top <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> words can appear between texts
    corresponding to two different days. A top <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> query appears as a tag like
    <tt>&lt;top 10 /&gt;</tt>. In order to facilitate you the
    process of reading from input, the number always will be
    delimited by white spaces, as in the sample.</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>All words are composed only of lowercase letters of size
        at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum number of different words that can appear is
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$20\, 000$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maximum number of words per day is <span class="tex2jax_process">$20\, 000$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Words of length less than four characters are considered
        of no interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The number of days will be at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq
        20$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> most
    frequent words during the last 7 days must be shown given a
    query. Words must appear in decreasing order of frequency and
    in alphabetical order when equal frequency. <em>There must be
    shown all words whose counter of appearances is equal to the
    word at position <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. Even
    if the amount of words to be shown exceeds <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span></em>.</p>
