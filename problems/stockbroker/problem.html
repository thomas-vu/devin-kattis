</div>Gina Reed, the famous stockbroker, is having a slow day
    at work, and between rounds of solitaire she is daydreaming.
    Foretelling the future is hard, but imagine if you could just
    go back in time and use your knowledge of stock price history
    in order to maximize your profits!

    <p>Now Gina starts to wonder: if she were to go back in time a
    few days and bring a measly <span class="tex2jax_process">$\$
    100$</span> with her, how much money could she make by just
    buying and selling stock in Rollercoaster Inc. (the most
    volatile stock in existence) at the right times? Would she earn
    enough to retire comfortably in a mansion on Tenerife?</p>
<p>Note that Gina can not buy fractional shares, she must buy
    whole shares in Rollercoaster Inc. The total number of shares
    in Rollercoaster Inc. is <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>, so Gina can not own more
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> shares at
    any time. In Gina’s daydream, the world is nice and simple:
    there are no fees for buying and selling stocks, stock prices
    change only once per day, and her trading does not influence
    the valuation of the stock.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le d \le 365$</span>), the number of days that Gina goes back
    in time in her daydream. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> lines, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th of which contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le p_ i \le 500$</span>) giving the price
    at which Gina can buy or sell stock in Rollercoaster
    Inc. on day <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. Days
    are ordered from oldest to newest.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum possible amount of money Gina can have on
    the last day. Note that the answer may exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{32}$</span>.</p>
