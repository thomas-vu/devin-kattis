        “Your ticket to success!”
      </div>
</div>
<p>After suffering an embarrassing defeat at the hands of Team
    Rocket, you come to the obvious conclusion that the only way to
    beat them is by teaching your own Meowth how to read.</p>
<p>To prevent burn out, you’ve created the following study
    plan: your Meowth will read every <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>th page, and you will read
    everything else aloud to them. But, because you have other
    things to do (Pokemon to catch, battles to win, what-have-you),
    you are only willing to read <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> pages in one sitting. You always
    read first. If it is Meowth’s turn to read once you finish your
    last page, let them read; you want them to practice as much as
    possible, after all! Otherwise, the session is over as soon as
    you complete your last page (even if Meowth doesn’t end up
    reading a single page). If it takes you <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> minutes to read a page and your
    Meowth <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> minutes to read
    a page, how much time, in minutes, will you spend reading
    together?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The only line of input contains 4 space-separated positive
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N, P \leq 10^{7}, 1 \leq X, Y \leq 60$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing a single integer: the amount of
    time in minutes you and your Meowth will spend reading
    together.</p>
