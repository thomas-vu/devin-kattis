<div class="problembody">
<p>There are two different species of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodical_cicadas">periodical
    cicadas</a> that only appear from hibernation every
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span> years, respectively. Your old
    grandpa tells you that he saw them simultaneously back in â€™92.
    You start pondering how many years you have to wait until you
    see them again. You collect information about other pairs of
    periodical cicadas and when they were last observed to find out
    when the next simultaneous appearance is.</p>
<p>Given several different pairs of cicadas and their last
    simultaneous appearance, find the next year that one of the
    pairs reappears.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le k \le 99$</span>), the number of pairs
    of periodical cicadas. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines, each containing three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1800 \le y \le 2021$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le c_1, c_2 \le 99$</span>), the year
    this pair was last observed and cycle lengths for the first and
    second species, respectively. You may assume that none of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> pairs reappears
    earlier than <span class="tex2jax_process">$2022$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the first year a pair reappears.</p>
