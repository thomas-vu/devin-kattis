<p>With modern technology advancement, it is now possible to
    deliver mail with a robot! There is a neighborhood on a long
    horizontal road, on which there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> houses numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> from left to right. Every day a
    mail delivery robot receives a pile of letters with exactly one
    letter for each house. Due to mechanical restrictions, the
    robot cannot sort the letters. It always checks the letter on
    top of the pile, visits the house that should receive that
    letter and delivers it. The robot repeats this procedure until
    all the letters are delivered. As a result, each of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> houses is visited by
    the robot exactly once during the mail delivery of a single
    day.</p>
<p>The mail delivery robot has a tracking device that records
    its delivery route. One day the device was broken, and the
    exact route was lost. However, the technical team managed to
    recover the <i class="it">moving directions</i> of the robot
    from the broken device, which are represented as a string
    consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>
    letters. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th letter
    of the string is ‘<tt class="tt">L</tt>’ (or ‘<tt class="tt">R</tt>’) if the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(i+1)$</span>-th house visited by the robot
    is on the left (or right) of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th house visited. For example, if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = 4$</span> and the robot
    visited the houses in the order of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2, 4, 3, 1$</span>, its moving directions
    would be “<tt class="tt">RLL</tt>”.</p>
<p>With the moving directions, it may be possible to determine
    the order in which the robot visited the houses. The technical
    team has asked you to write a program to do that. There can be
    multiple orders producing the same moving directions, among
    which you should find the lexicographically earliest order.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input has a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$</span>) on the first line. The second
    line has a string of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> consisting of letters
    ‘<tt class="tt">L</tt>’ and ‘<tt class="tt">R</tt>’ giving the
    moving directions of the robot.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the lexicographically earliest order in which the
    robot may have visited the houses and delivered the letters
    according to the moving directions. Consider two different
    integer sequences of equal length <span class="tex2jax_process">$A = (a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_ k)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B = (b_1, b_2, \ldots , b_
    k)$</span>, and let <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i \le
    k$</span> be the lowest-numbered index where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i \ne b_ i$</span>. Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> is lexicographically earlier than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> if <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i &lt; b_ i$</span>; otherwise
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> is lexicographically
    earlier than <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>.</p>
