<p>Farmer Laura has a barn. In her barn, she has two cows,
    Monica and Lydia. Monica and Lydia love food, and they are
    quite lazy. For most of the day they chill out in the barn,
    waiting for Laura to come serve them a nice meal. Farmer Laura
    is always very precise about when to serve them food, so Monica
    and Lydia know exactly when to expect food, the same time every
    day.</p>
<p>This might sound surprising to you but there’s a problem.
    Farmer Laura needs your help. She will be replacing some planks
    in the floor of the barn, which means that the cows have to be
    moved temporarily from their favorite spots. Since the cows are
    infinitely lazy, they refuse to walk themselves. Farmer Laura
    has rented an excellent tool to resolve this issue – a <em>cow
    crane</em>, designed and crafted specifically for the cow’s
    comfort.</p>
<p>We visualize the barn as a one-dimensional line. The cow
    crane starts at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t =
    0$</span> at position <span class="tex2jax_process">$x =
    0$</span>, and it can move one distance unit per second. The
    crane can only carry one cow at a time, but it may pick up and
    drop off a cow as many times as necessary. Monica’s current
    location is at <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = m$</span>,
    and Lydia is located at <span class="tex2jax_process">$x =
    l$</span>. Monica will be moved to the temporary location at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = M$</span> and Lydia to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = L$</span>. Monica and Lydia
    always have their daily meal <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_
    m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ l$</span>
    seconds into the day, so the cows had better be in their
    respective temporary locations exactly by these times. You may
    assume that it takes no time for the crane to pick up or drop
    off a cow and that the two cows can be at the same position at
    the same time.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Farmer Laura would like to know if she can move the cows so
    that both of them are in place at their temporary location no
    later than their daily meal occurs.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of three lines. The first line consists of
    two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>, the current positions
    of the cows. The second line consists of two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>, the new positions of the cows.
    The third line consists of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ l$</span>, the time at which the two cows
    will be served their daily meal. It is guaranteed that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^8 \leq m, l, M, L \leq
    10^8$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq t_ m, t_
    l \leq 10^8$</span>. It is also guaranteed that both cows will
    actually move, i.e., <span class="tex2jax_process">$m \not=
    M$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$l \not=
    L$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output should consist of a single word. Print “<tt class="ttfamily">possible</tt>” if it is possible to move both cows
    before they are served their daily meal. Otherwise, print
    “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”.</p>
