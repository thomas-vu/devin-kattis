<p>The artist Jackson Pollock used to create works of art by,
    among other things, dripping paint onto the canvas. He died in
    1956, but, if he were alive today, he would probably appreciate
    some computational help in planning out his masterpieces.</p>
<p>We start with a large, white canvas. We let drops of paint
    fall onto the canvas one after another, letting each one dry
    before the next. Thus, successive drops paint over the color
    left by previous drops. When a drop of paint hits the canvas at
    point <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, it spreads out
    to form a circle of uniform thickness centered at <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>. A drop of volume <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> will spread out to a circle of
    radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$v = \pi r^2$</span>. Since
    underlying paint is already dry, all points a distance of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> or less from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> will be colored with
    the new drop’s color. Your job is to determine the final color
    of various points on the painting.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le c \le 100$</span> indicating the
    number of painting descriptions which follow. Each painting
    description starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100$</span> giving the number of
    paint drops that will be applied to the painting. This is
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines,
    each starting with three real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> and a color. The location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(X, Y)$</span> is the location
    of the drop, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> is
    its paint volume. The color is given as a string with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> characters (a–z, either case).
    Each painting description is followed by a series of queries.
    The query list starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le 100$</span>, giving the number
    of queries. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each containing a the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> coordinates of the query. All real
    values are in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0, 1\,
    000]$</span> with at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> digits after the decimal point.
    All queries fall somewhere on the canvas.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query, output the color of the paint at that point
    on the canvas.</p>
