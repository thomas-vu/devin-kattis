<p>An interesting theory in mathematics is that there is a
    sequence generator that, given any positive integer as the
    starting point, always ends with the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Although this theory has never
    been proven, the conjecture is known as the Collatz Conjecture
    (named after Lothar Collatz, who posed the idea in 1937). Given
    an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n\geqslant
    1$</span>, this conjecture pertains to the sequence
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h(n)$</span>, which we
    recursively define as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=1$</span>, the
        sequence is composed of a single integer: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is even, the
        sequence is composed of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> followed by sequence
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$h(n/2)$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is odd, the
        sequence is composed of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> followed by sequence
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$h(3\cdot n + 1)$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, the following are the sequences for the numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$h(5) = (5, 16, 8, 4, 2,
      1)$</span></p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$h(7) = (7, 22, 11, 34, 17,
      52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1)$</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$h(n)$</span> sequence is
    commonly known as the <em>hailstone sequence</em>, because of
    its nature of going up and down like a hailstone in a cloud
    before eventually falling to Earth. In this problem, you will
    calculate the <em>sum</em> of all the values in a hailstone
    sequence. Using the sequences above, the sum of <span class="tex2jax_process">$h(5)$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$36$</span> and the sum of <span class="tex2jax_process">$h(7)$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$288$</span>.</p>
<center>
<p><b class="bfseries">Your solution must use a
      <em>RECURSIVE</em> function,<br/>
      based on the recursive definition of <span class="tex2jax_process">$h(n)$</span> presented above.</b></p>
<p><b class="bfseries">On the exam, any other type of
      solution will receive zero points!</b></p>
<p><b class="bfseries">EVEN IF KATTIS JUDGES IT AS
      CORRECT!</b></p>
</center>
<p>Note: You <em>are</em> allowed to add up the numbers
    iteratively, as long as the <span class="tex2jax_process">$h(n)$</span> sequence is computed
    recursively.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a single positive integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; n \leqslant 2^{32}-1$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output contains a single integer: the sum of all the
    values in <span class="tex2jax_process">$h(n)$</span>. You may
    assume that this sum will fit in an unsigned 64-bit
    integer.</p>
