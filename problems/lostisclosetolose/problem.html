<p>Better Documents Inc. is contemplating the next
    generation of word processors. Now, nearly every word processor
    includes a Spell Checker. BDI, however, is looking forward to
    replacing that with a true Typo Checker. We’ve all been caught,
    after relying on a spell checker, by typing mistakes (“typos”)
    that just happen to wind up as a correctly spelled word, just
    not the word we intended. BDI hopes to use AI to determine when
    a word’s context suggests that it is out of place and probably
    should have been a different, but similarly spelled, word.</p>
<p>As a first step in this process, they want to see how common
    such similar words really are in ordinary text. Write a program
    to read in paragraphs of text and to produce a list of
    similarly spelled words occurring in that text.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this program, a <em>word</em> is any
    maximal string of non-whitespace characters containing at least
    one alphabetic character. <em>Whitespace</em> can be either
    blanks or line terminators (“<tt class="ttfamily">\r</tt>” or
    “<tt class="ttfamily">\n</tt>”). The <em>core</em> of a word is
    what you have left after removing any non-alphabetic characters
    and replacing any upper-case alphabetic characters to their
    lower-case equivalents.</p>
<p>Two words are considered to be <em>similarly spelled</em> if
    the core of one word can be converted to the core of the other
    word by a single application of any one of the following
    transformations:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Delete a single character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Insert a single alphabetic character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Replace a single character by a different alphabetic
        character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transpose (exchange) any two adjacent characters.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> lines of text,
    followed by an end of input marker in the form of a line
    containing only the string “***”.</p>
<p>Each line of text will contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$80$</span> ASCII characters (not counting
    line terminators).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each word core in the text that has one or more
    similarly spelled words, print a line consisting of</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>That word core</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A colon (“:”) followed by a blank</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A list of all similarly spelled word cores (with no
        duplicates and not containing the core to the left of the
        colons), in alphabetic order, separated by single
        spaces.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The lines printed should be in alphabetic order of the word
    cores to the left of the colon.</p>
<p>If there are no similarly spelled words in the input, print
    a single line containing the string “***”.</p>
