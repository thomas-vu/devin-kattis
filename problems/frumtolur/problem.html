<p>Welcome to Forritunarkeppni Framhaldsskólanna! IF you have
    competed before you might know that the problem authors are
    smitten with primes. For you newcomers a brief description of
    prime numbers follows.</p>
<p>An integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is
    considered to be prime if it can only be divided by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. For example <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> is not prime because it can be
    divided by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>. On the other hand <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span> is a prime number because it can
    only be divided by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>. In the same way we
    see that <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span> are primes but <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> aren’t.</p>
<p>In this first problem we ask you to write a program that
    finds the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>
    primes. The program may print the primes in any order it likes
    and it does not need to print all of them. The solution gets
    one point for each prime it prints, so the more the better. If
    the program prints a number that’s not among the first
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> primes, it will get
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> points.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There is no input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first hundred primes, or a subset of them, in any order.
    Each number should be on its own line.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample Inputs</h2>
<p>In the sample the first five primes are printed. A solution
    printing these five numbers gets <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> points.</p>
