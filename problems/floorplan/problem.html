<p>You are an architect and you have just been appointed to
    build a new swimming hall. The organisation behind these plans
    has acquired funding for a swimming pool and surrounding
    building as large as they want, but unfortunately they could
    not find anyone willing to pay for the floor surrounding the
    pool. They decided to pay for the floor tiles out of their own
    pocket. Because this has already cost them an arm and a leg,
    they want you to use all the floor tiles in your proposed
    plan.</p>
<p>Being an architect, you care for aesthetics. You see it as
    absolutely vital that both the swimming pool and the
    surrounding building are perfect squares. This raises an
    interesting problem: how can you make sure that the square
    shapes are guaranteed, while still using all the floor tiles
    the organisation bought?</p>
<p>Given the number of tiles <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, find the length of the side of
    the building <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and and
    the length of the side of the pool <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=m^2-k^2$</span>, or print <tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt> if no suitable <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> exist.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 10^9$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print two non-negative integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = m^2 - k^2$</span>, or print <tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt> if no such integers exist. If there
    are multiple valid solutions, you may output any one of
    them.</p>
