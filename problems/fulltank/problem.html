<div class="problembody">
<p>After going through the receipts from your car trip through
    Europe this summer, you realised that the gas prices varied
    between the cities you visited. Maybe you could have saved some
    money if you were a bit more clever about where you filled your
    fuel?</p>
<p>To help other tourists (and save money yourself next time),
    you want to write a program for finding the cheapest way to
    travel between cities, filling your tank on the way. We assume
    that all cars use one unit of fuel per unit of distance, and
    start with an empty gas tank.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input gives <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq m \leq 10\, 000$</span>,
    the number of cities and roads. Then follows a line with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p_ i \leq 100$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> is the fuel price
    in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th city. Then
    follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines with
    three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq u,v &lt;
    n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d \leq
    100$</span>, telling that there is a road between <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> with length <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>. Then comes a line with the number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq q \leq 100$</span>,
    giving the number of queries, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines with three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq c \leq 100$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is the fuel capacity of the
    vehicle, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is the
    starting city, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> is
    the goal.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query, output the price of the cheapest trip from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> using a car with the given
    capacity, or “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>” if there is
    no way of getting from <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> with the given
    car.</p>
