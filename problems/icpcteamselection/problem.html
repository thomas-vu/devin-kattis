<div class="problembody">
<p>The coach of Nha Trang University, Mr. Van, has just
    organized a contest to form its ICPC teams. There were students
    participating in the contest. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> student scored
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_ i$</span> in the contest.</p>
<p>The coach wants to form <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> different teams (each team has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> students) to take part
    in the regional contest based on the results from this contest.
    In his experience, the performance of a team is usually equal
    to the median of team members’ individual results (i.e. the
    result of the second-best student).</p>
<p>The coach wants to maximize <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> – the sum of his <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> teams’ performance. Your task is
    to calculate <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several datasets. The first line of
    the input contains the number of datasets which is a positive
    integer and is not greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>. The following lines describe the
    datasets.</p>
<p>Each dataset is described by the following lines:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(N \le 100)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$3N$</span> positive integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$P_1, P_2, \ldots ,
        P_{3N}$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(P_ i \le
        100)$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each dataset, output the value <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>.</p>
<h2>Explanation for the Sample Dataset</h2>
<p>One way to form two teams is:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Team <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>: student
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, student
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, student
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Team <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>: student
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, student
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, student
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
