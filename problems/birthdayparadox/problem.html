<div class="description">
        The probability of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        unique birthdays among <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> people.
      </div>
</div>
<p>The Birthday Paradox is the name given to the surprising
    fact that if there are just <span class="tex2jax_process">$23$</span> people in a group, there is a
    greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$50\% $</span>
    chance that a pair of them share the same birthday. The
    underlying assumptions for this are that all birthdays are
    equally likely (which isn’t quite true), the year has exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$365$</span> days (which also
    isn’t true), and the people in the group are uniformly randomly
    selected (which is a somewhat strange premise). For this
    problem, we’ll accept these assumptions.</p>
<p>Consider what we might observe if we randomly select groups
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$P=10$</span> people. Once we
    have chosen a group, we break them up into subgroups based on
    shared birthdays. Among <i class="itshape">many</i> other
    possibilities, we might observe the following distributions of
    shared birthdays:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>all <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> have
        different birthdays, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>all <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> have the
        same birthday, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> people have the
        same birthday, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
        other people have the same birthday (on a different day),
        and the remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>
        all have different birthdays.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, these distributions have different probabilities
    of occurring.</p>
<p>Your job is to calculate this probability for a given
    distribution of people sharing birthdays. That is, if there are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> people in a group, how
    probable is the given distribution of shared birthdays (among
    all possible distributions for <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> people chosen uniformly at
    random)?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line gives a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 365$</span>. The second line
    contain integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1$</span>
    through <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ n$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le c_ i \le 100$</span> for
    all <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span>. The value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span> represents the
    number of people who share a certain birthday (and whose
    birthday is distinct from the birthdays of everyone else in the
    group).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Compute the probability <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> of observing a group of people
    with the given distribution of shared birthdays. Since
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> may be quite small,
    output instead <span class="tex2jax_process">$\log
    _{10}(b)$</span>. Your submission’s answer is considered
    correct if it has an absolute or relative error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> from the judge’s
    answer.</p>
<h2>Explanations</h2>
<p>The first sample case shows <span class="tex2jax_process">$P=2$</span> people with distinct birthdays.
    The probability of this occurring is <span class="tex2jax_process">$b = 364/365 \approx 0.9972602740$</span>,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\log _{10}(b) \approx
    -0.001191480807419$</span>.</p>
<p>The second sample case represents the third example in the
    list given earlier with <span class="tex2jax_process">$P=10$</span> people. In this case, the
    probability is <span class="tex2jax_process">$b \approx
    0.0000489086$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\log
    _{10}(b) \approx -4.310614508857128$</span>.</p>
