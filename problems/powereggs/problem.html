<p>Benedict bought <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    identical power eggs from Dropeggs.com, and now he wants to
    test them by dropping them from different floors of his
    building. His building has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> floors numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> is an unknown number in the range
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, inclusive. Each egg will break if
    dropped from floor <span class="tex2jax_process">$F+1$</span>
    or above, but will not break if dropped from floor <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> or below. Benedict can drop each
    egg as many times as he wants from any floor until it breaks.
    He wants to know the minimum number of egg drops necessary to
    ensure that he can determine <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span>.</p>
<p>For example, if there are three floors and Benedict has only
    one egg, then he has to first throw the egg from the first
    floor, then from the second floor (if the egg survived), and
    then from the third floor (if the egg survived). Therefore,
    three drops are required in the worst case.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains one number <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq T \leq 10\, 000$</span>) which is the number of test
    cases, followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    lines. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines contains two numbers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of floors
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 2\, 000\, 000\,
    007$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, the
    number of eggs (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq K \leq
    32$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    lines, print the minimal number of drops required, or if itâ€™s
    greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span>, print
    the word <tt class="ttfamily">Impossible</tt>. After that many
    drops, Benedict gets too tired and cannot continue.</p>
