</div>Paul owns a catering company and business is booming. The
    company has <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> catering
    teams, each in charge of one set of catering equipment. Every
    week, the company accepts <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> catering requests for various
    events. For every request, they send a catering team with their
    equipment to the event location. The team delivers the food,
    sets up the equipment, and instructs the host on how to use the
    equipment and serve the food. After the event, the host is
    responsible for returning the equipment back to Paulâ€™s company.

    <p>Unfortunately, in some weeks the number of catering teams is
    less than the number of requests, so some teams may have to be
    used for more than one event. In these cases, the company
    cannot wait for the host to return the equipment and must keep
    the team on-site to move the equipment to another location. The
    company has an accurate estimate of the cost to move a set of
    equipment from any location to any other location. Given these
    costs, Paul wants to prepare an Advance Catering Map to service
    the requests while minimizing the total moving cost of
    equipment (including the cost of the first move), even if that
    means not using all the available teams. Paul needs your help
    to write a program to accomplish this task. The requests are
    sorted in ascending order of their event times and they are
    chosen in such a way that for any <span class="tex2jax_process">$i &lt; j$</span>, there is enough time to
    transport the equipment used in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> request to the location of
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{th}$</span> request.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 100$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le k \le 100$</span>) which are the number of requests and the
    number of catering teams, respectively. Following that are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, where the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-i+1$</span> integers between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span> inclusive. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{th}$</span> number in the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> line is the cost
    of moving a set of equipment from location <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to location <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+j$</span>. The company is at location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> requests are at locations
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n+1$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the minimum moving cost to service all requests.
    (This amount does not include the cost of moving the equipment
    back to the catering company.)</p>
