<p>In the nearby kindergarten they recently made up an
    attractive game of strength and agility that kids love.</p>
<p>The surface for the game is a large flat area divided into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \times N$</span> squares.</p>
<p>The children lay large spongy cues onto the surface. The
    sides of the cubes are the same length as the sides of the
    squares. When a cube is put on the surface, its sides are
    aligned with some square. A cube may be put <em>on another
    cube</em> too.</p>
<p>Kids enjoy building forts and hiding them, but they always
    leave behind a huge mess. Because of this, prior to closing the
    kindergarten, the teachers rearrange <em>all</em> the cubes so
    that they occupy a rectangle on the surface, with <em>exactly
    one</em> cube on every square in the rectangle.</p>
<p>In one move, a cube is taken off the top of a square to the
    top of any other square.</p>
<p>Write a program that, given the state of the surface,
    calculates the smallest number of moves needed to arrange all
    cubes into a rectangle.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le M
    \le N^2$</span>), the dimensions of the surface and the number
    of cubes currently on the surface.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines contains two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le R, C \le N$</span>), the coordinates of the square that
    contains the cube.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the smallest number of moves. A solution will always
    exist.</p>
<h2>Explanation of Sample Data</h2>
<p>In the first example, it suffices to move one of the cubes
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 1)$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 2)$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 1)$</span>.</p>
<p>In the third example, a cube is moved from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 3)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3, 3)$</span>, from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(4, 2)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 5)$</span> and from <span class="tex2jax_process">$(4, 4)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3, 5)$</span>.</p>
