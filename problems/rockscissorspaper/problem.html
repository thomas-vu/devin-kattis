<p>Bart’s sister Lisa has created a new civilization on a
    two-dimensional grid. At the outset each grid location may be
    occupied by one of three life forms: Rocks, Scissors, or
    Papers. Each day, differing life forms occupying horizontally
    or vertically adjacent grid locations wage war. In each war,
    Rocks always defeat Scissors, Scissors always defeat Papers,
    and Papers always defeat Rocks. At the end of the day, the
    victor expands its territory to include the loser’s grid
    position. The loser vacates the position.</p>
<p>Your job is to determine the territory occupied by each life
    form after <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> days.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le t \le 5$</span>, the number of test
    cases. Each test case begins with three posititve integers not
    greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, the number of rows and columns in
    the grid, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the
    number of days. The grid is represented by the <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines that follow, each with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> characters. Each
    character in the grid is ‘<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>’,
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">S</tt>’, or ‘<tt class="ttfamily">P</tt>’, indicating that it is occupied by Rocks,
    Scissors, or Papers respectively.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print the grid as it appears at the end
    of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>th day.</p>
