<div class="problembody">
<p>Hunt the Wumpus is a game you play against the computer on a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10 \times 10$</span> grid. At
    the beginning of the game, four wumpuses are randomly placed on
    the grid (with no two sharing a location). You need to find and
    capture all four wumpuses. You guess a square by entering the
    coordinates as two decimal digits. If you correctly guess the
    location of a wumpus, you are told you did so, and that wumpus
    is captured and removed from the grid. Whether or not you hit a
    wumpus, the Manhattan distance between your guess and the
    closest wumpus is reported to you. You can use this to locate
    and find each wumpus. The game ends when the last wumpus is
    captured.</p>
<p>You have been asked to write the computer portion of the
    game. User guesses and randomly-generated wumpus locations are
    defined by a two-digit number, where the high digit is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and the low digit is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> for the point
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y)$</span>.</p>
<p>To make the game deterministic, we will use our own
    pseudo-random-number generator, with a supplied seed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>. Each random number is
    generated by first setting <span class="tex2jax_process">$s
    \leftarrow s + \hbox{floor}(s/13) + 15$</span> and then
    returning the two low digits of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>. The first four distinct numbers
    generated by this process are the locations of the four
    wumpuses. For a seed of 132, the first location is given by the
    two low digits of <span class="tex2jax_process">$132 + 10 +
    15$</span>, which is <span class="tex2jax_process">$57$</span>
    and corresponds to the position <span class="tex2jax_process">$(5, 7)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$10^4 \le s\le 10^6$</span>), the seed for
    the random number generator. Each of the remaining lines
    contains a two-digit number (possibly with leading zeros).
    These are the guesses that a player has made, each
    corresponding to a single grid location.</p>
<p>The input will always be well-formed, and will describe a
    complete game. The last user guess will always find the last
    wumpus. There will be at most 250 guesses in any input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the computer’s response for each player guess. If a
    guess hits a wumpus, you should output “<tt class="tt">You hit
    a wumpus!</tt>” on a line. Whether or not the player hit a
    wumpus, if any wumpuses remain uncaptured, output the Manhattan
    distance to the closest remaining wumpus. The Manhattan
    distance between two points <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2, y_2)$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$|x_1 - x_2| + |y_1 - y_2|$</span>, and will
    therefore always be an integer.</p>
<p>At the end of the game, report the total number of moves
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> required to locate all
    the wumpuses by outputting “<tt class="tt">Your score is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> moves.</tt>” on a
    line.</p>
