<div class="description"></div>
</div>Oliver is a manager of a bank near KTH and wants to close
    soon. There are many people standing in the queue wanting to
    put cash into their accounts after they heard that the bank
    increased the interest rates by <span class="tex2jax_process">$42\% $</span> (from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.01\% $</span> per year to <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.0142\% $</span> per year).

    <p>However, there are too many people and only one counter is
    open which can serve one person per minute. Greedy as Oliver
    is, he would like to select some people in the queue, so that
    the total amount of cash stored by these people is as big as
    possible and that money then can work for the bank
    overnight.</p>
<p>There is a problem, though. Some people don’t have the time
    to wait until the bank closes because they have to run
    somewhere else, so they have to be served before a certain
    time, after which they just leave. Oliver also turned off the
    infrared door sensor outside the bank, so that no more people
    can enter, because it’s already too crowded in the hall.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Help Oliver calculate how much cash he can get from the
    people currently standing in the queue before the bank closes
    by serving at most one person per minute.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\leq N\leq 10\, 000)$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\le T \le 47)$</span>, the number of
    people in the queue and the time in minutes until Oliver closes
    the bank. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines, each with 2 integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>,
    denoting the amount of cash in Swedish crowns person
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> has and the time in
    minutes from now after which person <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> leaves if not served. Note that it
    takes one minute to serve a person and you must begin serving a
    person at time <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> at
    the latest. You can assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le c_ i \le 100\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le t_ i &lt; T$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with the maximum amount of money you can get
    from the people in the queue before the bank closes.</p>
