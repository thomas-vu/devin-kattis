<p>Your friend from Manhattan is visiting you in Amsterdam.
    Because she can only stay for a short while, she wants to see
    as many tourist attractions in Amsterdam in as little time as
    possible. To do that, she needs to be able to figure out how
    long it takes her to walk from one landmark to another. In her
    hometown, that is easy: to walk from point <span class="tex2jax_process">$m = (m_ x, m_ y)$</span> to point
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = (n_ x, n_ y)$</span> in
    Manhattan you need to walk a distance</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ |n_ x - m_ x| + |n_ y - m_ y|, \]</span>
<p>since Manhattan looks like a rectangular grid of city
    blocks. However, Amsterdam is not well approximated by a
    rectangular grid. Therefore, you have taken it upon yourself to
    figure out the shortest distances between attractions in
    Amsterdam. With its canals, Amsterdam looks much more like a
    half-disc, with streets radiating at regular angles from the
    center, and with canals running the arc of the circle at
    equally spaced intervals. A street corner is given by the
    intersection of a circular canal and a street which radiates
    from the city center.</p>

<p>Depending on how accurately you want to model the street
    plan of Amsterdam, you can split the city into more or fewer
    half rings, and into more or fewer segments. Also, to avoid
    conversion problems, you want your program to work with any
    unit, given as the radius of the half circle. Can you help your
    friend by writing a program which computes the distance between
    any two street corners in Amsterdam, for a particular
    approximation?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$M,N$</span> and a real number
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq
            100$</span> is the number of segments (or ‘pie slices’)
            the model of the city is split into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq
            100$</span> is the number of half rings the model of
            the city is split into.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq R \leq
            1000$</span> is the radius of the city, given with at
            most <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> digits
            after the decimal point.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with four integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ x, a_ y, b_ x, b_ y$</span>, with
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a_ x, b_ x \leq
        M$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a_ y,
        b_ y \leq N$</span>, the coordinates of two corners in the
        model of Amsterdam.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing a single real number, the
    least distance needed to travel from point <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> to point <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> following only the streets in the
    model. The result should have an absolute or relative error of
    at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
