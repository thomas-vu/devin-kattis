<div class="problembody">
<p>A prime number <span class="tex2jax_process">$p \geq
    2$</span> is an integer which is evenly divisible by only two
    integers: 1 and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>. A
    composite integer is one which is not prime. The fundamental
    theorem of arithmetic says that any integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> can be expressed uniquely as a set
    of <em>prime factors</em> – those prime numbers which, when
    multiplied together, give <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>. Consider the prime factorization
    of the following numbers:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[
    10 = 2 \times 5 \hspace{0.3in} 16 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times
    2 \hspace{0.3in} 231 = 3 \times 7 \times 11 \]</span>
<p>Consider the following process, which we’ll call prime
    reduction. Given an input <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>if <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is prime,
        print <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and stop</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>factor <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> into its
        prime factors <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1, p_2,
        \ldots , p_ k$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>let <span class="tex2jax_process">$x = p_1 + p_2 +
        \cdots + p_ k$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>go back to step 1</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Write a program that implements prime reduction.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a sequence of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20\, 000$</span> integers, one per line, in
    the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>. The number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> will not be included
    in the sequence (try it to see why it’s excluded). Input ends
    with a line containing only the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each integer, print the value produced by prime
    reduction executed on that input, followed by the number of
    times the first line of the process executed.</p>
