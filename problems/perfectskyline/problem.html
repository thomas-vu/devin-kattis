<p>Zara, an aspiring architect and urban planner, has drawn out
    what she considers to be the perfect skyline. As Zara is still
    aspiring she must use her young daughter, Pippa, to test out
    her designs. In order to test out the designs Pippa must build
    them out of her building blocks! The building blocks Pippa has
    have a uniform width and depth, but come in different heights
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>. Zara’s description
    for Pippa will consist of a list of buildings, each with a
    target height <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>.</p>
<p>Pippa must then use some (not necessarily all) of her blocks
    to stack together such that the sum of the heights of the
    blocks in each stack corresponds to the height of the building
    in the skyline. Since Pippa prefers building instead of solving
    puzzles she wants you to determine how she must stack the
    blocks so that she must only do the stacking!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single test case. The first line of
    this test case contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 15$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le S
    \le 15$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    is the number of blocks Pippa has and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is the number of buildings in the
    skyline Zara made.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le h_ i \le 10^{9}$</span>) representing
    the heights of each of the blocks. The last line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> integers (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le b_ i \le 10^{9}$</span>) representing
    the heights of each of the buildings.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it is possible for Pippa to build Zara’s skyline then
    output <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> lines. On each
    line output a single number <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_
    i$</span> representing the number of blocks needed to build
    building <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> corresponds to the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> building
    listed in the input. This should be followed (on the same line)
    by <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> representing the
    blocks of the input used in building <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> represents the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{\text {th}}$</span> block appearing the
    input.</p>
<p>If no combination of the blocks can build the desired
    skyline then output <tt class="ttfamily">-1</tt>.</p>
