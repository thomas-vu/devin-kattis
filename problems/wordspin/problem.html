<div class="problembody">
<p>Å½ofka invented a new word puzzle. She gives you two strings
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_2$</span> of the same length. You need to
    modify <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1$</span> into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_2$</span> as quickly as
    possible. The trick is that you are allowed to modify the
    strings only using the following types of moves: (1) shift
    forward where you choose a substring of one of the strings and
    shift each of its letters by 1 forward in the alphabet, or (2)
    shift backward where you shift each letter in a substring
    backward in the alphabet. The first move is not allowed if the
    substring contains the letter <tt class="tt">z</tt> while the
    second move is not allowed if the subtring contains <tt class="tt">a</tt>. What is the smallest number of moves you need to
    modify <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1$</span> into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_2$</span>?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each word puzzle is described on a single line that contains
    the strings <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_2$</span> separated by space.
    The strings contain only lower case letters. You may also
    assume that the length of each string is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with the smallest number of moves needed to
    modify <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1$</span> into
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_2$</span>.</p>
<h2>Note</h2>
<p>The first sample input can be modified in the following way.
    First shift <tt class="tt">lo</tt> forward, getting <tt class="tt">helmp</tt>. Then shift <tt class="tt">h</tt> forward 12
    times, getting <tt class="tt">telmp</tt>. Then shift <tt class="tt">l</tt> 11 times backward to get <tt class="tt">teamp</tt>
    and then shift <tt class="tt">p</tt> forward three times to get
    <tt class="tt">teams</tt>. Total number of moves is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1+12+11+3=27$</span>.</p>
<p>The second sample input can be modified as follows. First
    shift the entire string forward, getting <tt class="tt">bbdddbbbb</tt>. Then shift <tt class="tt">ddd</tt>
    backward twice to get <tt class="tt">bbbbbbbbb</tt>. This
    requires 1+2=3 moves.</p>
