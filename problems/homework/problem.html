<div class="problembody">
<p>Anthony has two multiple choice assignments to hand in
    today. The answer to each assignment is a string, where the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> letter
    represents the answer to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> question.</p>
<p>But instead of handing in two strings, Anthony only hands in
    a single string. He claims he answered every question correctly
    but his little sister Cora merged his two strings into a single
    string. Moreover, Cora merged his string in such a way that the
    following conditions are satisfied:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>For any two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq i&lt;j&lt;|s_1|$</span> (where
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$|s_1|$</span> is the length
        of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1$</span>), the index
        of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1[i]$</span> in
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is less than the
        index of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1[j]$</span> in
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq i&lt;j&lt;|s_2|$</span>, the index
        of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_2[i]$</span> in
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is less than the
        index of <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_2[j]$</span> in
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Can you help Anthony’s teacher verify whether Anthony’s
    claim is possible?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>. It is guaranteed that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq |s|\leq 10\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<p>The next two lines contain strings <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_2$</span> respectively. It is guaranteed
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq |s_1|, |s_2|\leq 5\,
    000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$|s_1|+|s_2|=|s|$</span>.</p>
<p>All the strings consists of only lowercase English
    letters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If Anthony’s claim is possible, print “yes” (without
    quotes). Otherwise, print “no” (without quotes).</p>
