<p>Rock-paper-scissors is a popular two-player game. In the
    game, each of the players uses their hand to show one of three
    symbols: rock, paper or scissors. If both players show the same
    symbol, the game is a tie. Otherwise, scissors beat paper,
    paper beats rock and rock beats scissors.</p>
<p>Sven has been studying the psychological intricacies of the
    game for years and has become a real master at the game, his
    friends not standing a chance against him in one-on-one
    games.</p>
<p>With the world championships around the corner, Sven is
    practicing his skills playing simultaneous games with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> of his friends. One
    such game consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>
    rounds. In each round, Sven and each of his friends show one of
    the three symbols.</p>
<p>When calculating the score, in each round, Sven’s symbol is
    independently compared to each of his friends’ symbols. Sven
    scores two points for every win and one point for every tie.
    Sven does not get points for losing.</p>
<p>Write a program that calculates Sven’s total score, and also
    his largest possible score had he known in advance all the
    symbols his friends would show.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le R \le 50$</span>), the number of rounds played.</p>
<p>The second line contains a string of <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> letters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">S</tt>’, ‘<tt class="ttfamily">P</tt>’ or
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>’. The string represents symbols
    that Sven showed in each round. ‘<tt class="ttfamily">S</tt>’
    is for scissors, ‘<tt class="ttfamily">P</tt>’ for paper,
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>’ for rock.</p>
<p>The third line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 50$</span>), the number of friends.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains a string of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> letters ‘<tt class="ttfamily">S</tt>’, ‘<tt class="ttfamily">P</tt>’ or
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>’. These are the symbols shown by
    each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> friends in
    each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>
    rounds.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output Sven’s actual score on the first line.</p>
<p>Output his largest possible score on the second line,
    assuming his friends didn’t change their symbols.</p>
