<p>The crown cork bottle stopper, used to seal beer bottles,
    was the first highly successful disposable product. It was
    invented by William Painter in 1892 in Baltimore; the product’s
    disposability and success inspired King C. Gillette to invent
    the disposable razor when he was a salesman for the Crown Cork
    Company.</p>
<p>Crown-corked bottles are supposed to be opened with a
    special tool called a bottle opener. However, with some
    practice, you can learn how to open a crown-corked bottle using
    another crown-corked bottle. This process opens the first
    bottle but leaves the second crown-corked; the first bottle’s
    cork is disposed of and not used again.</p>
<p>Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> crow-corked
    bottles, devise a plan to open <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> of them with this procedure (if
    possible).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (the
    number of crown-corked bottles), followed by the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (the desired number of
    open bottles), on separate lines. You can assume <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq k\leq n\leq 100$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>” if there is no
    way to open <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> of the
    bottles. Otherwise print exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines for the form “<tt class="ttfamily">open 4 using 9</tt>”, meaning that bottle 4 is
    opened with bottle 9. In general, the form is “<tt class="ttfamily">open <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> using
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span></tt>”, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> are distinct integers from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 1,\ldots , n\} $</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> is not yet opened.</p>
<h2>Explanation of sample 1</h2>
<p>In sample <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, there
    are three bottles, and you want to open one of them. This can
    be done, for instance using bottle <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> to open bottle <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. (There are other ways of doing
    this. Any valid answer is accepted.)</p>
<h2>Explanation of sample 2</h2>
<p>In sample <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, there is
    one bottle. Bottles can’t be used to open themselves, so it is
    impossible to achieve an open bottle.</p>
