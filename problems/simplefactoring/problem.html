<div class="problembody">
<p>Ms. Alice was working on making some factoring homework for
    her students last week, where the students get questions in the
    form of <span class="tex2jax_process">$ax^2+bx+c$</span>, and
    must rewrite the expression in the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$(dx+ e)(fx + g)$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a,b,c,d,e,f,g$</span> are integers. She is
    done making the questions, but wants someone to check them over
    to make sure the expressions are factorable.</p>
<p>The expression <span class="tex2jax_process">$ax^2+bx+c$</span> is factorable if and only
    if the expression <span class="tex2jax_process">$ax^2+bx+c$</span> is able to be successfully
    rewritten in the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$(dx+ e)(fx
    + g)$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a,b,c,d,e,f,g$</span> are integers.</p>
<p>To help Ms. Alice, you must check if each question is
    factorable!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the number of test cases
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0&lt;n\le 100$</span>. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each consist of
    three space separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0&lt;a,b,c\leq 10^{8}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line consisting of “YES” if
    factorable, and “NO” otherwise.</p>
