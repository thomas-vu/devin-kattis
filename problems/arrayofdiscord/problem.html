</div>Once upon a time, high up on Mount Olympus, it came to
    pass that the gods held a competition to see who among them was
    the best at sorting lists of integers. Eris, the goddess of
    discord, finds this terribly boring and plans to add some
    mischief to the mix to make things more fun. She will sabotage
    the answers of Zeus so that his list of numbers is no longer
    sorted, which will no doubt be so embarrassing that he becomes
    furious and starts a minor war.
    <p>Eris must be careful not to be discovered while performing
    her sabotage, so she decides to only change a single digit in
    one of the numbers in Zeus’ answer. The resulting number may
    not have any leading zeros (unless it becomes equal to zero in
    which case a single zero digit is allowed). Eris can only
    replace a digit with another digit – adding or removing digits
    is not allowed.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n \leq 100$</span>), the length of Zeus’ answer. The
    second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_
    n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a_1 \le a_2
    \le \ldots \le a_ n \leq 10^{15}$</span>), Zeus’ answer.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If Eris can make the list not be sorted by changing a single
    digit of one of the numbers, then output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_1, \ldots , b_ n$</span>, the resulting
    list of numbers after making the change. Otherwise, output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>”. If there are many valid
    solutions, any one will be accepted.</p>
