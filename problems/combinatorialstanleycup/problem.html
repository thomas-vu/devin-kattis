<p>You have always dreamt to get your name on the Stanley Cup,
    but you have never played hockey. A friend of yours heard of an
    alternative: the Combinatorial Stanley Cup! If you solve a
    single programming problem, you will get your name on this
    purely fictional trophy. What an opportunity!</p>
<p>The problem is simple: for a given <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, find the number of odd
    coefficients in the binomial <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1+x)^ N$</span>. Oh! Thereâ€™s a catch:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> can be as big as
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> billions!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The only line in the input is an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq N \leq 2\, 000\, 000\, 000$</span>,
    the degree of the binomial <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1+x)^ N$</span> for which you need to
    determine how many of its coefficients are odd.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The number of odd coefficients.</p>
