<p>In the distant future, an older Twilight Sparkle is visited
    by her faithful student, Luster Dawn. Luster has always been
    diligent with her studies in magic, but wonders why Twilight
    places so much focus on friendship in the curriculum; she sees
    it as a distraction and a waste of time. After all, friendships
    take work, are complicated, and to top it all off, there’s no
    guarantee they’ll last. Why bother with them?</p>
<p>Of course, Twilight was in that position herself once, and
    she knows firsthoof the importance of friendship. To help
    Luster understand, Twilight recollects her adventures with her
    friends...</p>
<p>In these few weeks you’ve come to have an adventure of your
    own. You’ve experienced the glory of victory and you’ve met
    face-to-face with defeat. You’ve learned to work alone and
    you’ve learned to work together. You’ve found that sometimes
    the obvious approach is the correct one—and that sometimes
    you’ll need to put in a bit more effort to find a solution.
    You’ve solved countless problems and the fact that you’re still
    here, after weeks of the most trying challenges, is a powerful
    testament to your exemplary ability and resilience. But there’s
    one last problem for you to solve: saying goodbye.</p>
<p>By the end of these five hours, you will be walking your
    separate ways, having taken all that we have had to offer.
    Goodbyes are always bittersweet, especially when they’re said
    to close friends and mentors. Perhaps we can make this one
    sting a little less?</p>
