<p>Quite often there is substantial noise in the classroom
    during class. Instead of paying attention to what the teacher
    is saying, the students rather discuss the economic crisis or
    Croatia’s joining the European Union.</p>
<p>The biggest noise often occurs when the students are idle,
    so teachers will give them tasks with a lot of work to calm
    them down. In one type of such task, the student must calculate
    the result of an arithmetic operation on two large numbers.</p>
<p>The arithmetic operations we will consider are adding and
    multiplication. The operands will be <em>powers of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span></em> with no more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> digits.</p>
<p>Write a program that calculates the result of the
    operation.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, the first operand.</p>
<p>The second line either the character ‘<tt class="ttfamily">+</tt>’ or ‘<tt class="ttfamily">*</tt>’,
    representing addition or multiplication.</p>
<p>The third line contains a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, the second operand.</p>
<p>The integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> will be powers of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> and consist of at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> digits.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the result of the operation.</p>
