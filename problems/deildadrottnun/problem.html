<p>The government is currently examining the universitiesâ€™
    finances. Last contest had you follow a system in which all
    departments got the same amount of money. This along with some
    other constraints made it such that some money went unused,
    which clearly has to be fixed. This time the government will
    assign each department some budget and remove all grant and
    funding request processes. This is done because some professors
    were so tired of grants and funding applications that they had
    started to bribe others into taking care of it for them.</p>
<p>To make sure the plutonium reserves of the universities of
    Iceland do not fall into the wrong hands it is important this
    is done well.</p>
<p>The departments of the universities have been ordered by
    size and should get appropriate funding, so no two departments
    that get funding can get the same amount of funding.
    Furthermore the first funded department must get one or two
    million ISK exactly. The next funded department must get two or
    three million ISK, the third exactly three or four million ISK
    and so on.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the amount of money
    to distribute, counted in millions of ISK. It is guaranteed
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq
    10^{10}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first line of output should contain a single integer,
    the number of departments that get funding. The next line
    should print the amount of money each department gets, given in
    increasing order and separated by spaces, all given in terms of
    millions of ISK. If there is more than one way to distribute
    the funding such that all constraints are met, any one of them
    will be accepted. The input will be such that at least one
    solution exists.</p>
