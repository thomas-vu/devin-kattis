<p>A zipline is a very fun and fast method of travel. It uses a
    very strong steel cable, connected to two poles. A rider (which
    could be a person or some cargo) attaches to a pulley which
    travels on the cable. Starting from a high point on the cable,
    gravity pulls the rider along the cable.</p>
<p>Your friend has started a company which designs and installs
    ziplines, both for fun and for utility. However, there’s one
    key problem: determining how long the cable should be between
    the two connection points. The cable must be long enough to
    reach between the two poles, but short enough that the rider is
    guaranteed to stay a safe distance above the ground. Help your
    friend determine these bounds on the length.</p>
<p>The cable connects to two vertical poles that are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> meters apart, at
    heights <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> meters, respectively.
    You may assume that the cable is inelastic and has negligible
    weight compared to the rider, so that there is no sag or slack
    in the cable. That is, at all times the cable forms two
    straight line segments connecting the rider to the two poles,
    with the sum of the segments lengths equal to the total length
    of the cable. The lowest part of the rider hangs <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> meters below the cable; therefore
    the cable must stay at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> meters above the ground at all
    times during the ride. The ground is flat between the two
    poles. Please refer to the diagram in Figure 1 for more
    information.</p>

</div>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each describe a
    zipline configuration with four integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>. These correspond to the variables
    described above. The limits on their values are: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le w, g, h \le 1\, 000\, 000$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le r \le \min (g,
    h)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each zipline, print a line of output with two lengths
    (in meters): the minimum and maximum length the cable can be
    while obeying the above constraints. Both lengths should have
    an absolute error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
