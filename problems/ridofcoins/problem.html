<p>When Per was living in New York, he couldn’t use his debit
    card as often as in Sweden. He had to carry cash all the time
    and his wallet was getting heavy from all the coins he was
    carrying around. He was once in a candy store buying a few
    kilos of candy and he wanted to get rid of as many coins as
    possible but couldn’t figure out how to do it without getting
    any change back.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>You will be given a price <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> that Per was going to pay. You
    will also be given the number of 1-, 5-, 10- and 25-cent coins
    that he had in his wallet. He didn’t have any notes. Find the
    maximum number of coins he could have used for paying the price
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> without getting any
    change back.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$P, 1\leq P\leq 100\, 000\, 000$</span>, the
    price Per was going to pay. On the second line there are 4
    space separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_1,
    N_5, N_{10}, N_{25}; 0\leq N_1, N_5, N_{10}, N_{25}\leq 100\,
    000\, 000$</span>, the number of 1-, 5-, 10- and 25-cent coins
    in Per’s wallet.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If Per couldn’t pay exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> without getting any change back,
    output <tt class="tt">Impossible</tt> on a single line.
    Otherwise output the maximum number of coins Per could use to
    pay the price <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>.</p>
