<div class="problembody">
<p>It’s tougher to find work these days than it has been in the
    past. However, you are fortunate to have a job leading people
    on walking tours around various areas in your city. There are
    two interesting things about your job. First, your contract
    requires you to take people on a walking circuit that never
    visits the same place more than once, since otherwise your
    clients get bored (the notable exception is that you must
    deliver them to the same place they started). Second, you get
    paid in proportion to the amount of time you are leading each
    tour. Thus, you are trying to find the <em>longest</em> tours
    possible that don’t repeat any location (other than finishing
    where you started). You’ve found that this is a difficult
    problem to solve by hand, even when there are a moderate number
    of places you can visit, so you want to write a program to
    solve it for you.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a set of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> test cases. Each test case starts
    with a line containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 10$</span> indicates the
    number of locations in the city, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le m \le n(n-1)/2$</span> indicates the
    number of unique streets that directly connect pairs of
    locations in the city. Locations are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines each contain a pair of
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, describing that there
    is a street that directly connects those two locations. Each
    street can be walked in either direction. The last valid test
    case is followed by a line containing a single zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the largest number of locations
    you can visit on the longest walking circuit. Tours always
    begin and end at intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
