<div class="problembody">
<p>Somewhere near the south pole, a number of penguins are
    standing on a number of ice floes. Being social animals, the
    penguins would like to get together, all on the same floe. The
    penguins do not want to get wet, so they have use their limited
    jump distance to get together by jumping from piece to piece.
    However, temperatures have been high lately, and the floes are
    showing cracks, and they get damaged further by the force
    needed to jump to another floe. Fortunately the penguins are
    real experts on cracking ice floes, and know exactly how many
    times a penguin can jump off each floe before it disintegrates
    and disappears. Landing on an ice floe does not damage it. You
    have to help the penguins find all floes where they can
    meet.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains a single test case, consisting of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 100$</span>) and a real
        number <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le D \le 100\,
        000$</span>, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> decimals after the decimal
        point), denoting the number of ice pieces and the maximum
        distance a penguin can jump.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, each
        line containing four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m_ i$</span>, denoting for each ice
        piece its <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> coordinate, the
        number of penguins on it and the maximum number of times a
        penguin can jump off this piece before it disappears
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\, 000 \le x_ i, y_ i
        \le 10\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le

        m_ i \le 200$</span>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing a space-separated list of
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>-based indices of
        the pieces on which all penguins can meet. If no such piece
        exists, output a line with the single number <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span>.</p>
