<p>Stan Ford is a typical college graduate student, meaning
    that one of the most important things on his mind is where his
    next meal will be. Fortune has smiled on him as he’s been
    invited to a multi-course barbecue put on by some of the
    corporate sponsors of his research team, where each course
    lasts exactly one hour. Stan is a bit of an analytical type and
    has determined that his eating pattern over a set of
    consecutive hours is always very consistent. In the first hour,
    he can eat up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    calories (where <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    depends on factors such as stress, bio-rhythms, position of the
    planets, etc.), but that amount goes down by a factor of
    two-thirds each consecutive hour afterwards (always truncating
    in cases of fractions of a calorie). However, if he stops
    eating for one hour, the next hour he can eat at the same rate
    as he did before he stopped. So, for example, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$m=900$</span> and he ate for five
    consecutive hours, the most he could eat each of those hours
    would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$900$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$600$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$400$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$266$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$177$</span> calories, respectively. If,
    however, he didn’t eat in the third hour, he could then eat
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$900$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$600$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$600$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$400$</span> calories in each of those hours.
    Furthermore, if Stan can refrain from eating for two hours,
    then the hour after that he’s capable of eating <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> calories again. In the example
    above, if Stan didn’t eat during the third and fourth hours,
    then he could consume <span class="tex2jax_process">$900$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$600$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$900$</span> calories.</p>
<p>Stan is waiting to hear what will be served each hour of the
    barbecue as he realizes that the menu will determine when and
    how often he should refrain from eating. For example, if the
    barbecue lasts <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> hours
    and the courses served each hour have calories <span class="tex2jax_process">$800$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$700$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$400$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$300$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> then the best strategy when
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m=900$</span> is to eat every
    hour for a total consumption of <span class="tex2jax_process">$800+600+400+266+177 = 2\, 243$</span>
    calories. If however, the third course is reduced from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$400$</span> calories to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span> calories (some
    low-calorie celery dish), then the best strategy is to not eat
    during the third hour — this results in a total consumption of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 900$</span> calories.</p>
<p>The prospect of all this upcoming food has got Stan so
    frazzled he can’t think straight. Given the number of courses
    and the number of calories for each course, can you determine
    the maximum amount of calories Stan can eat?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line containing two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$n
    \leq 100, m \leq 20\, 000$</span>) indicating the number of
    courses and the number of calories Stan can eat in the first
    hour, respectively. The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> positive integers indicating the
    number of calories for each course.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the maximum number of calories Stan can consume.</p>
