<div class="problembody">
<p>As you design your new household helper robot, the
    SERVE-O-MATIC 1000, you are running it through a number of
    tests. In one test, you want to make sure that it always knows
    where it is. In particular, you’re concerned about the
    situation where the robot runs into a wall that it is not aware
    of. For example, if it tries to walk forward <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> meters and runs into a wall it
    didn’t know about after <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> meters, then there will be a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>-meter difference in
    where it stopped and where it <em>thinks</em> it stopped. Your
    robot does not yet have the intelligence to incorporate new
    information on the fly, such as this new wall, so it still
    thinks it walked <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    meters.</p>
<p>To test how bad this problem might be, you test a virtual
    robot in a virtual room, where the robot is not aware of the
    size of the room. The robot chooses a walking course, and your
    program simulates the robot’s walk, keeping track of where it
    thinks it is, and where it actually is (by preventing it from
    walking through walls). After the simulation finishes, you want
    to know how far off the robot is from where it thinks it
    is.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> simulations.</p>
<p>Each simulation starts with a room description, which is two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> (for width and length
    of the rectangular room, in meters). Each is in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[2, 100]$</span>. The robot may
    walk anywhere in the rectangle marked by the corners
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span> to (<span class="tex2jax_process">$w-1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$l-1$</span>), including the edges (so it may
    walk to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span> or
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(w-1, 0)$</span>, for example).
    The robot always starts at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span>, and its steps are each
    exactly one meter long.</p>
<p>After the room description is a description of the path the
    robot plans to take. This description starts with an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 100$</span>, the
    number of walking segments in the path. This is followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> segment descriptions
    to be followed in order. Each segment is given on a line as
    <tt class="tt">x y</tt>, where <tt class="tt">x</tt> is one of
    <tt class="tt">u</tt>, <tt class="tt">d</tt>, <tt class="tt">l</tt>, or <tt class="tt">r</tt> (for up, down, left, or
    right, respectively), and <tt class="tt">y</tt> is number of
    meters to move in that direction (in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0, 30]$</span>). Up and down move along the
    length of the room, left and right along the width. Up and
    right are in the positive direction, while down and left are in
    the negative direction.</p>
<p>Input ends when <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> are zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each simulation, output where the robot thinks it is as
    <tt class="tt">Robot thinks x y</tt>, and where it actually is
    as <tt class="tt">Actually at x y</tt> (for appropriate
    coordinate values x and y).</p>
