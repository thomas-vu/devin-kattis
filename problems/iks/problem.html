<div class="problembody">
<p>Mirko’s great grandmother Katica is an avid mathematician.
    She likes to torment Mirko with math games. This time she wrote
    down a sequence of numbers on a piece of paper and told Mirko
    he may do the following:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Choose any two numbers in the sequence (let’s call them
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>) and a prime number
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> such that
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> is divisible by
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>. After that, Mirko
        erases <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and writes
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$A/X$</span> in its place. In
        the end he erases <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>
        and writes <span class="tex2jax_process">$B\cdot X$</span>
        in its place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Mirko may perform this operation as many times he wants. His
    goal is to obtain the maximum possible score, because he gets
    candy from his great grandmother if he does so. The score for
    one sequence is the greatest common divisor of all the numbers
    in the sequence.</p>
<p>He is not very good at this, and he likes his candy so he
    has asked you to help him. Write a program that will calculate
    the maximum possible score. Since you are such a nice person,
    you should also print the smallest number of times Mirko must
    perform the operation to obtain the maximum possible score.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 100$</span>), the number of elements in the
    starting sequence.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> positive integers smaller than or
    equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span>,
    the sequence Katica gave to Mirko.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The one and only line of output should contain two integers.
    The first integer is the maximal possible score Mirko can
    obtain. The second integer is the smallest number of operations
    Mirko needs to perform to obtain it.</p>
