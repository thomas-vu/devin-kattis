<div class="problembody">
<p>Alex and Barb are waiting for their two cousins to visit for
    dinner. Since their cousins tend to get involved in all sorts
    of shenanigans, Alex and Barb decide to pass the time with a
    little card game.</p>
<p>The game is as follows: there is a stack of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> cards on the table. Alex and Barb
    take turns taking from <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cards, beginning
    with Alex. The first player with no valid moves left loses.</p>
<p>Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, determine which player will win
    the game provided that both play with an optimal strategy.</p>
<h2>Inputs</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing three
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq
    k \leq 10^9$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m
    \leq n \leq 10^9$</span>.</p>
<h2>Outputs</h2>
<p>On a single line output the name of the winning player.</p>
