<p>Nicholas Neverson was a student at Northlings Neverland
    Academy. As with any daydreaming student, Nicholas was playing
    around with a Kaleidoscope one day instead of paying attention
    to the teacher. Since this was math class, his daydreams
    quickly turned to palindromic numbers. A palindromic number is
    any number which reads the same forwards and backwards.</p>
<p>He describes his vision to you at lunch: numbers which are
    palindromic in several bases at once. Nicholas wonders how many
    such numbers exist. You decide you can quickly code up a
    program that given a range and a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, outputs the number of numbers
    palindromic in all bases <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq j \leq k$</span>, in that range.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of three space-separated integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>. The input satisfies the following
    constraints:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 0 \leq a \leq
    b \leq 2\, 000\, 000, \\ 2 \leq k \leq 100\, 000. \]</span>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the quantity of numbers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> inclusive which are palindromes in
    every base <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq j \leq k$</span>.</p>
