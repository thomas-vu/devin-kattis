<p>Alf and Beata were two young adults living together a long,
    long time ago, before you could spend all your afternoons
    competing in programming. Their lives were thus much more
    boring than those of today’s young adults. How could you even
    survive back then, you might ask yourself. The answer is
    simple: you make your own chocolate bars! Our two cohabitants
    loved making chocolate bars, and often had huge piles of them
    each afternoon. To avoid filling their entire living room with
    chocolate bars, Beata challenged her friend to a game every
    evening to eat up all the chocolate – the Chocolate Division
    game.</p>
<p>The Chocolate Division game is played by two players (in our
    case, Alf and Beata) using a chocolate bar consisting of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rows, each containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> squares of chocolate.
    A move consists of splitting a rectangular piece of chocolate
    either horizontally or vertically into two pieces, such that
    the two new pieces again have integer height and width. The
    first move is performed on the original chocolate bar. Each
    subsequent move can performed on any piece of chocolate that
    has been split off so far, as long as it doesn’t have
    dimensions <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \times 1$</span>
    (no split can be done on such a piece). Alf starts with the
    first move. If, at any point, a person can not perform their
    move because all remaining pieces have size <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \times 1$</span> squares, that person
    loses.</p>
<p>Can you compute who wins the game, if both players play
    optimally?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line contains the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le R, C \le 500$</span>), the height and width of the original
    chocolate bar.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <tt class="ttfamily">Alf</tt> if Alf wins the game,
    or <tt class="ttfamily">Beata</tt> if Beata wins the game.</p>
