<div class="problembody">
<p>Alice and Bob are playing a card game. There are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2n$</span> cards uniquely
    numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2n$</span>. The cards are
    shuffled and dealt to the two players so that each player gets
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cards. Each player
    then arranges the cards they get into a deck in any order that
    they choose, facing down.</p>
<p>The game has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> turns.
    In each turn, both players reveal the card that is on the top
    of their deck and compare the numbers on the two cards. The
    player with the larger card wins and scores one point. This is
    repeated until all cards in the decks are compared.</p>
<p>After getting her <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    cards, Alice wonders what is the minimum and maximum number of
    points she may possibly score in the game.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 1\, 000$</span>), the number
    of cards that Alice gets.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    have a single integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2n$</span> (both inclusive) giving a card
    that is dealt to Alice. It is guaranteed that all those cards
    are unique.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two integers, the minimum and maximum number of
    points Alice may score.</p>
