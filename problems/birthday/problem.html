</div>James needs some help figuring out whether he can invite
    all of his friends to his birthday party. Luckily for James, he
    doesn’t have to invite all of his friends by himself, because
    his friends will forward invitations to each other.

    <p>Consider this example: James has three friends: Lucy, Sue,
    and Mark. James is friends with all three of them, but
    unfortunately he doesn’t have Mark’s phone number so he can’t
    invite him directly. However, Sue has Mark’s number (and vice
    versa) so she can invite Mark to James’s party.</p>
<p>The question that you need to answer is that if anyone lost
    one of the phone numbers for anyone else, would it be
    impossible to invite everybody to the party? Continuing the
    above example, if Sue lost Mark’s number (the edge denoted by
    the red arrow above), then it would not be possible to invite
    everybody to the party. You should assume that if Sue loses
    Mark’s number, then Mark will also lose Sue’s number. Please
    help James figure out if he is at risk at having someone miss
    his party if any pair of friends loses contact with each
    other.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will contain up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> test cases. Each test case
    contains on a single line two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le p \le 100$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le c \le 5000$</span>). <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> represents the number of people
    James wants to invite to the party, including himself. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> lines represent the
    connections among James’s friends represented as two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le a &lt; p$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le b &lt; p$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> is not equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. This means that friend number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> has friend number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>’s phone number and
    vice versa.</p>
<p>The input will be terminated by a line containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> zeros. This case
    should not be processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, if a pair could lose each other’s
    numbers and make it so that not everybody can be invited to the
    party, print “Yes”. Otherwise, print “No”.</p>
