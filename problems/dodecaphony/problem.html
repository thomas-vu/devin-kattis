<div class="problembody">
<p>In the past century, a new style of music composition has
    emerged. Unlike more traditional methods based on keys and
    chords, the technique known as <i class="itshape">dodecaphony</i> focuses on using all twelve notes
    equally. As a quick reminder, the twelve notes, in ascending
    order are,</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ C, C\sharp , D,
    D\sharp , E, F, F\sharp , G, G\sharp , A, A\sharp , B \]</span>
<p>The sequence then wraps around so that the next note after
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> and so on. For this problem, we’ll
    ignore equivalent notations that use flats, double sharps, or
    double flats.</p>
<p>Each successive note above is considered one <i class="itshape">semitone</i> away from the next. Now in our
    simplified version of dodecaphony, a melody is a permutation of
    the previous melody by one of three relations.</p>
<p>First, we have <i class="itshape">transposition</i>, where
    each note has been shifted up by <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> semitones. A <i class="itshape">retrograde</i> is when the notes have their order
    reversed. Finally we have <i class="itshape">inversion</i>
    about the first note of the melody. With inversions, the first
    note doesn’t change, but the rest of the notes are inverted
    such that the the interval (number of semitones) between that
    note and the first note is negated.</p>
<p>For example, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> is
    our first note, and we want to invert an <span class="tex2jax_process">$A\sharp $</span>, which is <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> semitones higher, the inverted
    note would be a <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, which
    is <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> semitones lower.
    Note that the first note in an inverted melody is always just
    the first note of the original melody.</p>
<p>Given two melodies, can you tell what relation the second
    has to the first?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq l \leq 50$</span>, the number of
    notes in each melody.</p>
<p>The next two lines each contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> space separated notes. It is
    guaranteed that each note will be one of the twelve listed
    above.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output on a single line “Transposition” if the second melody
    is a transposition of the first, “Retrograde” if the second
    melody is the first melody reversed, “Inversion” if the second
    melody is an inversion of the first melody, else “Nonsense” if
    it is none of the other cases.</p>
<p>If the second melody satisfies more than one relation,
    output the first valid relation in the order of
    “Transposition”, then “Retrograde”, then “Inversion”.</p>
