<p>“Hey Bill, you were in charge of shipping those novelty book
    remainders to Remainderville, OH, right?” asked Fred. “Those
    were cute little books weren’t they, each shaped like a cube
    one inch on each side. I can’t understand why they didn’t sell
    better. Can you remind me how many we shipped?”</p>
<p>“Well,” started Bill, “I can’t remember the number exactly.
    I do remember that we tried three different size boxes. When we
    used the largest box size we had <span class="tex2jax_process">$407$</span> books remaining after filling
    all of the rest completely. When we tried the second largest
    box size we had <span class="tex2jax_process">$409$</span>
    books left over, and when we tried the smallest box size we
    only had <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span> books left
    over.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” a slightly puzzled Fred continued, “then just let me
    know the box sizes and the number of boxes you used.”</p>
<p>“Funny thing” replied Bill, “I can’t remember that either. I
    do remember that the boxes were made from a <span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$21$</span> inch sheet of cardboard, with
    squares cut out at each of the four corners. We then folded the
    sides up to make an open top box, filled each box with books,
    then used packaging tape to attach a lid. The dimensions of
    each box were all integer multiples of inches.”</p>

<p>“You seem to have a very selective memory,” a now aggravated
    Fred complained.</p>
<p>“Well, if it helps, I know that the three different box
    sizes were the three largest possible to make from those sheets
    of cardboard. I also know that we had between <span class="tex2jax_process">$20,000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$30,000$</span> books to ship. I think that
    should give you enough to determine the total number of
    books.”</p>
<p>“So let me get this straight. You’re giving me the
    dimensions of the sheets of cardboard, the fact that the box
    sizes are the three largest that can be made from them, the
    number of books left over after using each of the box sizes,
    and a range in which the number of books lies, correct?” said
    Fred, rubbing his increasingly aching head.</p>
<p>“That’s it,” confirmed Bill.</p>
<p>“Sounds like some grossly convoluted computer programming
    problem!”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Go figure?”</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of seven positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$a
    \leq b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$7 \leq a,b \leq
    100$</span>) are the dimensions of the sheets of cardboard (in
    inches), <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq c,d,e \leq 10^9$</span>) are the number of books left over
    for the three largest size boxes possible for the given size
    cardboard sheets (in order from largest box size to third
    largest box size) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span> specify an
    inclusive range for the number of books (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq f &lt; g \leq 10^9$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of books which satisfy all the conditions
    of the problem. Each problem is guaranteed to have a unique
    answer.</p>
