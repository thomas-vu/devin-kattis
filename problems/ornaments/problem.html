</div>A factory is making ornaments for the upcoming holidays.
    Ornaments consist of a 2D glass sphere (i.e., a circle) that is
    designed to hang off a hook or nail using a string that tightly
    wraps around the ornament, as shown in the figure to the right.

    <p>Your task is to write a program that calculates the length
    of the string, given the radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> of the circle, the distance
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> from the knot to the
    center of the circle, and some multiplier to account for the
    excess needed to tie the knot.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will contain multiple test cases, up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span>. Each test case
    contains on a single line three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le r \le 10,000$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$r
    \le h \le 10,000$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le s \le 100$</span>). <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> denotes the necessary excess
    string in %. The percentage is relative to what would be needed
    without accounting for the knot, so if <span class="tex2jax_process">$s = 25$</span>, you should increment the
    necessary length by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/4$</span>.</p>
<p>The input will be terminated by a line containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> zeros.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the length of the needed string,
    rounded to two decimals.</p>
