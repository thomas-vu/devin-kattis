</div>Today the Intergalactic Council of Pebble Coins (ICPC)
    conducted an intergalactic auction of the Neutronium Chaos
    Pebble Coin (NCPC). This coin, which was forged in the Ancient
    Coin Machine (ACM), is rumored to be the key to ruling the
    universe.
    <p>Due to the extremely competitive nature of the auction, as
    well as the odd mechanics of the intergalactic currency used
    (far too advanced for mere mortals to understand), the auction
    was conducted with the following rules:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>only one participant was allowed to make a bid at a
        time,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>each participant was only allowed to make one bid,
        and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a participant making a bid had to bid at least twice the
        amount of the highest bid at the time.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first participant making a bid was allowed to make a bid
    of any positive amount.</p>
<p>After the auction there were a lot of sore losers –
    understandably, having just lost their chance at world
    domination. To make the losers feel a little better and prevent
    possible rioting, the ICPC has decided to hold a lottery for
    the participants. The winners of the lottery are determined as
    follows. The ICPC picks a random number <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>. A group of participants is called
    <em>winning</em> if the sum of their bets from the auction is
    equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>. A
    participant wins the lottery and receives a prize – a shiny
    Pebble Coin – if they belong to any winning group of
    participants.</p>
<p>Given the names of the participants, the bets that they
    made, and the random number <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> chosen by the ICPC, help them
    determine which participants won the lottery.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1\, 000$</span> is the number of
    participants, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le s &lt;
    10^{1\, 000}$</span> is the random number chosen by the
    ICPC.</p>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    describing the participants. Each line contains a string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> and an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> is the name of a participant, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le b &lt; 10^{1\,
    000}$</span> is the amount of his bet. The name of each
    participant is unique and consists of between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> letters from the English
    alphabet.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    denoting the number of participants that won the lottery. Then
    output <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines
    containing the names of the participants that won the lottery,
    one per line, in any order.</p>
