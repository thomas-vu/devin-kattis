        Illustration of the case <span class="tex2jax_process">$k=2$</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Olav is spending an evening on his own, practicing in the
    bowling hall. Annoyingly, the side-rails in his lane are stuck
    in the active position, so if the ball goes out of bounds, then
    it simply bounces back in. This seems unfair to Olav, so he
    decide that any throw that does not bounce exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> times in the fences before it hits
    the pins will be disqualified.</p>
<p>For this purpose, Olav has studied in detail how the ball
    bounces. His finding is that a ball hitting the fence with
    angle <span class="tex2jax_process">$\alpha $</span> relative
    to the normal, will bounce back with degree</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ \arctan (2 \tan (\alpha )) \]</span>
<p>relative to the normal. See the example in the picture to
    the right.</p>
<p>With which angle <span class="tex2jax_process">$\beta
    $</span> relative to the normal against the rails should Olav
    throw the ball to hit a strike after first bouncing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> times? Note that to
    hit a strike, Olav must hit <em>exactly</em> the middle of the
    bowling lane when the ball reaches the end of the lane. He
    always begins the throw from the middle of the lane as
    well.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains three positive
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span>. Here, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq k \leq 10$</span>) is the number of bounces required,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq w \leq 100$</span>) is the width of
    the bowling lane, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell
    $</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq \ell \leq
    100$</span>) is the length of the bowling lane.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single real number, the angle <span class="tex2jax_process">$\beta $</span> in degrees. Any answer within
    an absolute or relative error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> will be accepted as a
    correct answer.</p>
