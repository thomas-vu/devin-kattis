<p>Some people think this is the easiest problem in today’s
    problem set. Some people think otherwise, since it involves
    sums of digits of numbers and that’s difficult to grasp.</p>
<p>If we multiply a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> with another number <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, the sum of digits typically
    changes. For example, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$m =
    26$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N=3029$</span>,
    then <span class="tex2jax_process">$N\cdot m = 78754$</span>
    and the sum of the digits is <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span>, while the sum of digits of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is 14.</p>
<p>However, there are some numbers that if multiplied by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> will result in the
    same sum of digits as the original number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. For example, consider
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m = 37, N=3029$</span>, then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N\cdot m = 112073$</span>, which
    has sum of digits 14, same as the sum of digits of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<p>Your task is to find the smallest positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> among those that will
    result in the same sum of the digits when multiplied by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. To make the task a
    little bit more challenging, the number must also be higher
    than ten.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several test cases. Each case is
    described by a single line containing one positive integer
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N, 1\leq N\leq 100\,
    000$</span>. The last test case is followed by a line
    containing zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print one line with a single integer
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> which is the
    minimal number such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$N\cdot
    p$</span> has the same sum of digits as <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is bigger than 10.</p>
