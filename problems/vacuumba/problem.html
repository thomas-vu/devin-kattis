<p>You are developing software for a new generation of robotic
    floor vacuums. Being an inexpensive, mass market robot, this
    device has a fairly simple way of navigating around the room.
    It can turn by some angle to the left or right and then move
    forward in a straight line. A plan for the robot consists of a
    sequence of these straight-line segments. The robot starts at
    the origin, facing in the positive <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> direction. Your job is to try to
    predict where the robot will be after following a plan.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of several test cases. The first line
    contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n
    \leq 25$</span> telling how many. Each of the following test
    cases begins with an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq m \leq 10$</span>, giving the number of segments in the
    robotâ€™s plan. This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each describing a segment
    in the plan. Each segment is described by a pair of real
    numbers, a rotation angle in degrees followed by a distance.
    The angle is in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-360,360]$</span> and the distance is in
    the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-100,100]$</span>.
    The rotation angle tells how much the robot should turn before
    moving forward the given distance. A positive rotation angle
    indicates a counter-clockwise turn. A negative angle indicates
    a clockwise turn. All real numbers have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> digits past the decimal.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print out the expected <span class="tex2jax_process">$X \; Y$</span> location of the robot after
    following the path. Your answer should be accurate to within
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span> for each
    coordinate.</p>
