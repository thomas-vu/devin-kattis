<p>One useful tool in image processing is applying filters to
    images. They can be used to remove noise, sharpen images, and
    many other things.</p>
<p>In this problem, let’s experiment with a new custom filter
    called the erosion filter. It takes in an image, then, for each
    pixel, the new value is the weighted average of the values of
    all the pixels in the image based on their distance.</p>
<p>To simplify this further, let’s just work with a
    one-dimensional array of integers instead of an image. Suppose
    we have an array <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> elements, and we want
    to apply the erosion filter to it. The new array <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> is computed as
    follows:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ B[i] = \sum
    _{j=1}^{n} \frac{A[j]}{2^{|i - j|}} \]</span>
<p>Informally, the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$B[i]$</span> is the weighted average of the
    values of all the elements in <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, with the elements closer to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> having a much greater
    effect.</p>
<p>Right now, we have this array <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> elements and you want to apply the
    erosion filter to it. The next step is to implement an
    algorithm to compute <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>!</p>
<p>Your answer will be considered correct if each value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B[i]$</span> that you computed
    is within <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span> of the
    correct value.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of elements in the
    array <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 100\, 000$</span>).</p>
<p>The next line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers, the values of the pixels
    in the image <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq A[i] \leq
    10^{9}$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>You should output a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <em>floating-point</em> numbers,
    the values of the pixels in the image <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. Your answer is considered correct
    if the absolute error of each value is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span>. In other words, if the
    correct value is <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
    your answer is <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$|x - y| \leq
    10^{-5}$</span>.</p>
