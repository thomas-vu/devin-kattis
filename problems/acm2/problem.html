<div class="problembody">
<p>ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) organizes the
    International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) worldwide
    every year.</p>
<p>In the ICPC, a team of three students is presented with a
    problem set that contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> problems<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000005"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> of
    varying types and difficulty levels. The teams are not told
    which problems are easier (or harder). As there is only one
    single computer per team, each team has to decide which one of
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N!$</span> possible problem
    solving orders that the team wants to use. This is called the
    “contest strategy” and teams who are expecting to do well in an
    ICPC should use the optimal contest strategy for their
    team.</p>
<p>However, when a contest has ‘First to Solve Problem
    [‘A’/‘B’/.../‘A’<span class="tex2jax_process">$+(N-1)$</span>]
    award’ — like this ICPC SG Regional Contest 15 — sponsored by
    Kattis, then some of the teams may throw the optimal contest
    strategy out of the window in order to grab the (smaller)
    award.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input describes a hypothetical scenario of a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$300$</span> minute contest.</p>
<p>The first line contains two non-negative integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 13$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq p \leq N-1$</span>. The
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> describes the
    number of problems in the problem set of this ACM ICPC and the
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is a 0-based
    index that describes the problem id that your team wants to
    solve first before attempting the other <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> problems.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers in the range between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$999$</span>, inclusive. Each integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> describes the
    estimated number of minutes to solve problem id <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> according to your team. You have
    discussed with your team mates that your team will not put the
    same estimation for two different problems, so there is no
    ambiguity.</p>
<p>As an ACM ICPC duration is <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> hours, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$300$</span> minutes, any estimation of
    strictly larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$300$</span>
    minutes for a certain problem <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> basically says that you estimate
    that your team cannot solve problem <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> during contest time.</p>
<p>In this problem, you can assume that all your team’s
    estimations are perfectly accurate, i.e. if your team
    estimates that your team needs <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> minutes to solve problem
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$270$</span> minutes to solve another problem
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>, and have no idea how
    to solve the rest, and decides to solve problem <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> first followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>, then after <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> minutes have elapsed from the
    start of contest, your team really gets an ‘Accepted’ verdict
    from Kattis for problem <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, immediately switches to problem
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> for the next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$270$</span> minutes, gets
    another ‘Accepted’ verdict from Kattis for problem <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> at exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$300$</span> minutes (in this problem,
    submission at minute <span class="tex2jax_process">$300$</span>
    is a valid submission<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000006"><sup class="footnotemark">2</sup></a>). Thus you
    have <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> Accepted problems
    and the total penalty time of <span class="tex2jax_process">$30+300 = 330$</span> minutes as per the ICPC
    rules.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$Num\_
    AC$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Penalty\_
    Time$</span> separated by a single space in one line.</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$Num\_ AC$</span> is the
    <em>highest</em> number of problems that your team can solve
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Penalty\_ Time$</span> is
    the <em>lowest</em> penalty minutes that your team can get in
    order to solve <span class="tex2jax_process">$Num\_ AC$</span>
    problems in this <span class="tex2jax_process">$300$</span>
    minutes ACM ICPC <b class="bfseries">if</b> your team insists
    to solve problem <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> first
    from the start of the contest and then use the remaining time
    to work on the other <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span>
    problems.</p>
<p>For the example scenario above, if your team decides to
    solve problem <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> first
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, then your
    team still solves <span class="tex2jax_process">$Num\_ AC =
    2$</span> Accepted problems, but with the total penalty of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$270+300 = 570$</span>
    minutes.</p>
