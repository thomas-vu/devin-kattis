<div class="problembody">
<p>Ms. Thomas is managing her class of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> students.</p>
<p>She placed all her students in a line, and gave the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th student from the
    left a card with the letter <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_
    i$</span> written on it.</p>
<p>She would now like to rearrange the students so that the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th student from the
    left has a card with the letter <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> written on it.</p>
<p>To do this, she will choose some consecutive group of
    students, and reverse their order. Students will hold on to
    their original cards during this process.</p>
<p>Sheâ€™s now wondering, what is the number of valid ways to do
    this? (It may be impossible, in which case, the answer is
    zero).</p>
<p>With sequences <span class="tex2jax_process">$abba$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$aabb$</span>, Ms. Thomas can
    choose the group <span class="tex2jax_process">$a(bba)$</span>.
    With sequences <span class="tex2jax_process">$caxcab$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$cacxab$</span>, Ms. Thomas
    can choose <span class="tex2jax_process">$ca(xc)ab$</span> or
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c(axca)b$</span>. With sequences
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span>, there are clearly no
    solutions.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is two lines of lowercase letters, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th character of <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> represent <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> respectively. It is guaranteed
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> have the same positive length, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> are not identical. The common
    length is allowed to be as large as <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a single integer, the number of
    ways Ms. Thomas can reverse some consecutive group of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> to form the line
    specified by string <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>.</p>
