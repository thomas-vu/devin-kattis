</div>Mia is a dice game for two players. Each roll consist of
    two dice. Mia involves bluffing about what a player has rolled,
    but in this problem we focus only on its scoring rules. Unlike
    most other dice games, the score of a roll is not simply the
    sum of the dice.

    <p>Instead, a roll is scored as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Mia (<span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> or
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$21$</span>) is always
        highest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next come doubles (<span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$22$</span>, and so on). Ties are broken
        by value, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$66$</span>
        being highest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All remaining rolls are sorted such that the highest
        number comes first, which results in a two-digit number.
        The value of the roll is the value of that number, e.g.
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> becomes <span class="tex2jax_process">$43$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input will contain multiple, distinct test cases. Each
    test case contains on a single line four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_0 \ s_1 \ r_0 \ r_1$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_0 \ s_1$</span> represent the
    dice rolled by player <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_0 \ r_1$</span> represents
    the dice rolled by player <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>. The input will be terminated by a
    line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>
    zeros.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output which player won, or whether
    there was a tie, using exactly the format shown below.</p>
<table class="sample" summary="sample data">
