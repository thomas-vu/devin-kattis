<div class="problembody">
<p>You are to read a sequence of lines and, for each line,
    compute the sum of the numbers on that line. Each line contains
    one or more numbers. Numbers are separated by commas. A number
    may be positive or negative (preceded by a minus sign), and may
    or may not contain a decimal part. Blanks may be imbedded
    between numbers and within numbers.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each line of input contains up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$72$</span> characters and adheres to the
    format described above. Every number will be at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^6$</span> in absolute value
    and contain at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>
    digits after the decimal point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line of input, print a single number that is the
    sum of all numbers on that line. Your answer will be accepted
    if it is within an absolute or relative error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$1e-6$</span> of the correct solution.</p>
