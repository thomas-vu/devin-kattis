<p>Once again, James Bond is fleeing from some evil people who
    want to see him dead. Fortunately, he has left a bungee rope on
    a nearby highway bridge which he can use to escape from his
    enemies. His plan is to attach one end of the rope to the
    bridge, the other end of the rope to his body and jump off the
    bridge. At the moment he reaches the ground, he will cut the
    rope, jump into his car and be gone.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he had not had enough time to calculate
    whether the bungee rope has the right length, so it is not
    clear at all what is going to happen when he jumps off the
    bridge. There are three possible scenarios:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The rope is too short (or too strong), and James Bond
        will never reach the ground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rope is too long (or too weak), and James Bond will
        be going too fast when he touches the ground. Even for a
        special agent, this can be very dangerous. You may assume
        that if he collides at a speed of more than 10 m/s, he will
        not survive the impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The rope’s length and strength are good. James Bond
        touches the ground at a comfortable speed and can
        escape.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As his employer, you would like to know whether James Bond
    survives or whether you should place a job ad for the
    soon-to-be vacant position in the local newspaper. Your
    physicists claim that:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The force with which James is pulled towards the earth
        is</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 9.81 * w, \]</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> is his
        weight in kilograms and 9.81 is the Earth acceleration in
        meters over squared seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mr. Bond falls freely until the rope tautens. Then the
        force with which the bungee rope pulls him back into the
        sky depends on the current length of the rope and
        is</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ k * \Delta l,
        \]</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$\Delta l$</span> is
        the difference between the rope’s current length and its
        nominal, unexpanded length, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is a rope-specific
        constant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the rope’s strength <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, the nominal length of the rope
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> in meters, the height
    of the bridge <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> in
    meters, and James Bond’s body weight <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, you have to determine what is
    going to happen to our hero. For all your calculations, you may
    assume that James Bond is a point at the end of the rope and
    the rope has no mass. You may further assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> are non-negative and that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> &lt; 200.</p>
<p>The input contains several test cases, one test case per
    line. Each test case consists of four floating-point numbers
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>) that describe the situation.
    Depending on what is going to happen, your program must print
    "<tt>Stuck in the air.</tt>", "<tt>Killed by the impact.</tt>",
    or "<tt>James Bond survives.</tt>". Input is terminated by a
    line containing four 0s, this line should not be processed.</p>
