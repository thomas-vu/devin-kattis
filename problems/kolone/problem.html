<p>When moving, ants form rows so that each ant except the
    first is behind another ant. It is not widely known what
    happens when two rows of ants moving in opposite directions run
    into each other in a passage too narrow for both rows to pass
    through. One theory says that, in that situation, ants will
    jump over each other.</p>
<p>From the moment the rows meet, each second every ant jumps
    over (or gets jumped over, as they agree upon) the ant in front
    of himself so that the two ants swap places, but only if the
    other ant is moving in the opposite direction. Find the order
    of the ants after <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    seconds.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$N_2$</span>, the numbers of ants in the
    first and second rows, respectively.</p>
<p>The next two rows contain the orders of ants in the first
    and second row (first to last). Each ant is uniquely determined
    by an uppercase letter of the English alphabet (this letter is
    unique between both rows).</p>
<p>The last line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0
    \leq T \leq 50)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the order of the ants after <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> seconds on a single line. Our
    viewpoint is such that the first row of ants comes from our
    left side and the other one from our right side.</p>
