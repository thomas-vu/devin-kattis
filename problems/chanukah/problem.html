<div class="problembody">
<p>The Jewish holiday of Chanukah lasts for eight days and
    eight nights. On the evening before each day, candles are lit
    in a menorah. On the first evening, one candle is lit, on the
    second, two are lit, and so on. However, each evening, an extra
    candle, called the shammas, is also lit (in fact, this candle
    is used to light the other candles). Thus, for the entire
    holiday, <span class="tex2jax_process">$44$</span> candles are
    necessary.</p>
<p>But what if Chanukah lasted a different number of days? How
    many candles would be needed?</p>
<p>For this problem, you will write a program that determines
    how many candles would be necessary for a Chanukah holiday
    lasting for a given number of days.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single decimal integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 10\, 000$</span>), which is the
    number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be
    processed identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single space,
    followed by a single decimal integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 10\, 000$</span>), which gives the number of days to
    assume for the holiday. The data set number <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> starts at <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and is incremented by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> for each data set.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is one line of output. The single
    output line consists of the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a space followed by
    the number of candles needed for an <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>-day Chanukah holiday.</p>
