<div class="problembody">
<p>There is an epic enduro race taking place around the lake
    Sjön sjön at LTH. The race lasts for 3 hours, and the goal is
    to complete as many laps as possible within this time. Whenever
    a participant passes the lap line before the end of the race,
    they need to start another lap. The participants finish their
    race when they pass the lap line at or after the time limit (3
    hours from the starting time). Some participants might do one
    or several extra laps after finishing the race but these laps
    do not count towards the race result.</p>
<p>During the race, the times at which participants pass the
    lap line are recorded (this does not include the time when they
    start), and after the race this information will be used to
    construct a rank list of all participants.</p>
<p>The participants are first ranked by the number of laps they
    completed, with participants having completed more laps being
    ranked higher. If multiple participants have completed the same
    number of laps, they are then ranked by the time that they
    finished their final lap, with earlier times being ranked
    higher. The race organizers have not considered how
    participants should be ranked if they finish the same number of
    laps in exactly the same amount of time, but that will probably
    not happen.</p>
<p>If a participant starts a lap but doesn’t finish it they get
    a DNF (did not finish) and are not included in the rank
    list.</p>
<p>A program for generating the rank list has been in
    development for the past couple of months by a team of second
    year computer science students. Unfortunately, the program
    appears to be highly unstable, and after inputting more than 20
    entries consumes more memory than available on any of the
    computers owned by the race organizers.</p>
<p>The race is starting soon and the race organizers need your
    help with writing a replacement program.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the starting time of the
    race, formatted as “<tt class="ttfamily">HH:MM:SS AM/PM</tt>”
    where “<tt class="ttfamily">HH</tt>” is an integer between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 — 12$</span>, “<tt class="ttfamily">MM</tt>” and “<tt class="ttfamily">SS</tt>” are
    integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 — 59$</span>,
    and “<tt class="ttfamily">AM/PM</tt>” is either the string AM
    or PM depending on whether the time is before or after noon.
    Midnight would be written “<tt class="ttfamily">12:00:00
    AM</tt>”, and noon would be written “<tt class="ttfamily">12:00:00 PM</tt>”.</p>
<p>The first line contains one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 10,000$</span>), the number of timestamps
    recorded.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contain a timestamp in the same format as the start time,
    followed by a space, followed by the name of the contestant
    passing the lap line at that time. Contestant names consist of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> characters, which can be
    uppercase and lowercase letters “<tt class="ttfamily">A</tt>”
    to “<tt class="ttfamily">Z</tt>” and space. Names will not
    contain more than one space, and they will not begin or end
    with a space.</p>
<p>The timestamps are sorted in ascending order, and it is
    guaranteed that no two timestamps are at exactly the same time.
    All timestamps are also guaranteed to be within <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> hours of the starting time (but
    not necessarily on the same day as the starting time).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line per participant that did not get a DNF,
    ordered according to the ranking rules described above, with
    the highest ranked participant listed first. Each line should
    contain the number of laps completed by that participant,
    followed by a space, followed by the participant’s name.</p>
