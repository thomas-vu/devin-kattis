<div class="problembody">
<p>A <em>qanat</em> is an irrigation system widely used to
    deliver water in hot, arid climates. The technology was
    originally developed by Persians over 2000 years ago. In
    Morocco, qanats are known as khettara and are still used today
    in the southern part of the country.</p>
<p>The basic feature of a qanat is an essentially horizontal
    channel that brings water from an underground water source to
    an outlet near a civilization. There is also a shaft known as a
    <em>mother well</em> that rises vertically from the underground
    water source to the surface of a mountain or hill. Creating
    such a system is extremely expensive, and was especially so in
    ancient times, since all of the materials excavated from the
    channel and mother well must be carried above ground, either
    through the channel outlet or the top of the mother well. To
    aid in the construction, there are often one or more additional
    vertical shafts placed at strategic locations above the
    underground channel. Although these shafts must also be
    excavated, they provide a means for lifting additional dirt
    from the horizontal channel as illustrated in Figure 1.</p>

<p>For this problem, model the cross-section of a qanat as
    shown in Figure 2, with the channel outlet at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span>, the water source at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(w,0)$</span>, and the top of
    the mother well at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(w,h)$</span>
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$w &gt; h$</span>. The
    surface of the mountain extends along a straight line from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(w,h)$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span>.</p>

<p>Every qanat must have a vertical mother well from the water
    source to the mountain surface above, along with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> additional vertical shafts. The
    channel and all shafts are modeled as line segments. Your goal
    is to determine the placement for those additional shafts so as
    to minimize the overall excavation cost. This cost is equal to
    the sum of the distances that each piece of excavated dirt must
    be transported to reach the surface (using any combination of
    horizontal and vertical movement). For example, the cost of
    excavating a continuous section of dirt starting from the
    surface and going along a path of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell $</span> (possibly including turns) is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\int _0^{\ell } x \, dx =
    \frac{1}{2} \ell ^2$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le w \le 10\, 000$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le h &lt; w$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>). The value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> is the horizontal
    distance from the water source to the qanat outlet. The value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> is the vertical
    distance from the water source to the mountain surface. The
    value <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of
    vertical shafts that must be used in addition to the mother
    well.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>First, display the minimum overall excavation cost. Next,
    display the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-coordinates, in increasing order,
    for <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> optimally placed
    vertical shafts. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$n &gt;
    10$</span>, display only the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-coordinates. Answers within an
    absolute or relative error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span> will be accepted. You may
    assume that there is a unique solution. No test case will
    result in a shaft within <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.001$</span> units from the outlet of the
    qanat channel or from another shaft.</p>
