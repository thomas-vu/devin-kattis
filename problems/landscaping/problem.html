<p>Preparations for a good harvest in Spring start now and
    farmer John is preparing his field for a good season. He went
    over-budget last year, as the tractors moving up and down the
    hills needed more fuel than he expected.</p>
<p>When harvesting, his tractors need to move both horizontally
    and vertically across all the land. In the image, you can see a
    region at low altitude in light green and a region at high
    altitude in dark green. When harvesting, his tractors will have
    to cross all the hills marked in red and they will have to go
    up or down <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> times.</p>

<p>This year, he is wondering whether he should level some
    parts of his field before sowing in order to lower his
    harvesting costs later on. Can you help him decide where the
    bulldozers should work in order to lower his costs?</p>
<p>Farmer John knows that his tractors need <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> additional euros when moving
    between adjacent patches of land at different heights. He can
    also pay <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> euros to
    either increase or decrease the height of any patch in his
    field.</p>
<p>What is the minimum amount of money he will have to pay this
    season?</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Given a description of the field, the price to change the
    height of a patch of land and the price his tractors pay when
    moving between adjacent patches, the goal is to find out the
    minimum amount that farmer John will have to pay this year.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> space separated integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> represent the dimensions of his
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N\times M$</span> field,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> represents the cost to
    move between adjacent patches of land at different levels and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> is the cost to change
    any patch of land.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each
    have <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> characters and
    represent farmer John’s field. A ’.’ signals a patch of land at
    a low level and a ’#’ represents a patch of land at a high
    level.</p>
<h2>Constraints</h2>
<table cellspacing="0" class="tabular">
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N,M \leq
          50$</span></p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>Size of the field.</p>
</td>

<td style="text-align:left">
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq A,B \leq 100\,
          000$</span></p>
</td>
<td style="text-align:left">
<p>Cost to change any height or to move between adjacent
          patches.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>You should output a single line with a single integer
    representing the minimum amount of money that farmer John will
    have to pay.</p>
<h2>Sample Output Explanation</h2>
<p>Farmer John has a <span class="tex2jax_process">$5\times
    4$</span> field. Moving between adjacent patches at a different
    level requires €<span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span> in
    fuel, while changing the height of a patch costs €<span class="tex2jax_process">$2000$</span>.</p>
<p>Farmer John needs €<span class="tex2jax_process">$11000$</span>: €<span class="tex2jax_process">$2000$</span> to change the isolated patch to
    a lower level and €<span class="tex2jax_process">$9000$</span>
    for the fuel needed to move between patches of land at
    different levels.</p>
<p>Not changing any patch would cost him €<span class="tex2jax_process">$12000$</span>, changing all the high patches
    to low would cost him €<span class="tex2jax_process">$18000$</span>, and changing all the low
    patches to high would cost him €<span class="tex2jax_process">$22000$</span>.</p>
