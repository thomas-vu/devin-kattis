<p>Interactive Creative Players Collective (ICPC) is working on
    a new computer game for which they want to generate realistic
    landscapes. One of the ICPC engineers proposed an algorithm
    inspired by geological processes. The algorithm starts with a
    flat landscape and repeatedly modifies it by lifting or
    lowering continuous blocks, thus forming <em>horsts</em>
    (lifted blocks) and <em>grabens</em> (lowered blocks). The
    blocks to be lifted or lowered are selected at random. ICPC
    hopes to obtain realistic landscapes this way.</p>
<p>Your task is to interpret any sequence of such modifications
    and output the resulting landscape. The landscape is
    represented by a sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integer height values, one for
    each integer point from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> on the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis. Figure 1 illustrates an
    example by connecting the height values with line segments.</p>

<p>Initially the height is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> at all <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> points. This flat shape is
    subjected to a sequence of modifications. Each modification
    applies one of the following four operations with two integer
    parameters <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1 \leq
    x_2$</span>:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Raise – increase the height by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> at all points between
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span> inclusive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Depress – decrease the height by <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> at all points between
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span> inclusive.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hill – add a new linearly shaped hill between
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Valley – add a new linearly shaped valley between
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Adding a hill to the current landscape works as follows. The
    heights at points <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span> are increased by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2 - x_1 &gt; 1$</span>, the heights at
    points <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1 + 1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2 - 1$</span> are increased by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2 - x_1 &gt; 3$</span>, the heights at
    points <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1 + 2$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2 - 2$</span> are increased by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, and so on. Figure 2
    shows an example. Adding a valley works in the same way except
    the heights are decreased instead. The maximal change of height
    happens in the middle between <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span>. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2 - x_1$</span> is odd, there will be two
    neighboring points with maximal change, otherwise just one.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 200\, 000$</span>) is the number of points, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq k \leq 200\, 000$</span>) is the
    number of modifications. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> points along the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis are numbered from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines describe the modifications.
    Each line contains one character <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> and two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (one of <tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">D</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">H</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">V</tt>) designates
    the operation and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq x_1 \leq x_2 \leq n$</span>) specify
    its parameters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, where
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> line
    contains the height at point <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> after applying all modifications
    in the given order.</p>
