<p>Kids like candy, so much that they start beating each other
    if the candy is not fairly distributed. So at your next party,
    you better start thinking before you buy the candy.</p>
<p>If there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> kids,
    you of course need <span class="tex2jax_process">$K \cdot
    X$</span> candies for a fair distribution, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> is a positive natural number. But
    you learned that there is always one kid that loses one candy,
    so you better be prepared with <b class="bf">exactly</b> one
    spare candy, resulting in <span class="tex2jax_process">$(K
    \cdot X) + 1$</span> candies.</p>
<p>Usually, the candies are packed into bags with a fixed
    number of candies <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> per
    bag. You will buy some of these bags so that the above
    constraints are fulfilled.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line gives the number of test cases <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; t &lt; 100$</span>). Each test case is specified by two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> on a single line,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> is the number of
    kids and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> the number of
    candies in one bag (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le K, C
    \le 10^9$</span>). As your money is limited, you will never buy
    more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> candy
    bags.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print one line. If there is no such
    number of candy bags to fulfill the above constraints, print
    “<tt class="tt">IMPOSSIBLE</tt>”. Otherwise print the number of
    candy bags you want to buy. If there is more than one solution,
    any will do.</p>
