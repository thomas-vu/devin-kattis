</div><span class="scshape">Set</span> is a card game designed
    by Marsha Falco in 1974 which is marketed by Set Enterprises,
    Inc. It also appears in syndicated form on the website of the
    New York Times. The player is shown 12 cards (see
    illustration), each of which contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> symbols. The symbols are either
    diamonds, squiggles, or ovals. Symbols are drawn using either a
    solid, striped, or open fill style. Each symbol’s color is
    either red, green, or purple. On a given card, all symbols are
    of the same type, same color, and have the same fill style.

    <p>To make a set, you must select three cards for which all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> characteristics are
    either the same or pairwise different. For instance,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> cards where the first
    shows <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> striped red
    ovals, the second shows <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> striped green squiggles, and the
    third shows <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> striped
    purple diamond form a set. They show <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> symbols (each has a different
    number); they show ovals, squiggles, and diamonds (each shows a
    different shape); they use colors red, green, and purple
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> different colors);
    and lastly, they all share the same fill style: striped.</p>
<p>Write a program that finds all sets for <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> provided cards!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input to your program will consist of <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> lines, each containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> strings representing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> cards, each consisting
    of four characters <span class="tex2jax_process">$ABCD$</span>
    where</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$A \in \{ \texttt{1},
        \texttt{2}, \texttt{3}\} $</span>, corresponding to the
        number of symbols.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$B \in \{ \texttt{D},
        \texttt{S}, \texttt{O}\} $</span>, corresponding to
        diamonds (D), squiggles (S), and ovals (O).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$C \in \{ \texttt{S},
        \texttt{T}, \texttt{O}\} $</span>, corresponding to solid
        (S), striped (T), and open (O) fill styles.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$D \in \{ \texttt{R},
        \texttt{G}, \texttt{P}\} $</span>, corresponding to red
        (R), green (G), and purple (P).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Think of the cards as being arranged in the input as
    follows:</p>
<pre>
+----------+
|  1  2  3 |
|  4  5  6 |
|  7  8  9 |
| 10 11 12 |
+----------+
</pre>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output all sets you can find, one per line. For each set,
    output the numbers of the card in the set in sorted order. The
    sets should be listed in sorted order using the number of their
    first card, breaking ties using the numbers of the second and
    third card in the set.</p>
<p>If no sets can be formed, output “<tt class="ttfamily">no
    sets</tt>”. (Do not include any punctuation.)</p>
