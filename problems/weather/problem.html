<div class="description"></div>
</div>You have been hired by the Association for Climatological
    Measurement, a scientific organization interested in tracking
    global weather trends over a long period of time. Of course,
    this is no easy task. They have deployed many small devices
    around the world, designed to take periodic measurements of the
    local weather conditions. These are cheap devices with somewhat
    restricted capabilities. Every day they observe which of the
    four standard kinds of weather occurred: <em>Sunny</em>,
    <em>Cloudy</em>, <em>Rainy</em>, or <em>Frogs</em>. After every
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> of these observations
    have been made, the results are reported to the main server for
    analysis. However, the massive number of devices has caused the
    available communication bandwidth to be overloaded. The
    Association needs your help to come up with a method of
    compressing these reports into fewer bits.

    <p>For a particular device’s location, you may assume that the
    weather each day is an independent random event, and you are
    given the predicted probabilities of the four possible weather
    types. Each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$4^ n$</span>
    possible weather reports for a device must be encoded as a
    unique sequence of bits, such that no sequence is a prefix of
    any other sequence (an important property, or else the server
    would not know when each sequence ends). The goal is to use an
    encoding that minimizes the expected number of transmitted
    bits.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 20$</span>, the number of
    observations that go into each report. The second line contains
    four positive floating-point numbers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_{\text {sunny}}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_{\text {cloudy}}$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_{\text {rainy}}$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_{\text {frogs}}$</span>, representing the
    respective weather probabilities. These probabilities have at
    most 6 digits after the decimal point and sum
    to 1.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the minimum expected number of bits in the encoding
    of a report, with an absolute or relative error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span>.</p>
