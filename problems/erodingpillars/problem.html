<div class="problembody">
<p>You’ve landed yourself in a real mess, or more accurately a
    cave filled with dilapidated and unstable pillars. You are
    luckily standing on a solid rock in the middle of the cave. You
    know there is a valuable artifact on one of the pillars in the
    cave, but you aren’t sure which one yet. While you wait for the
    results of a scan of the cave, you start building a robot to
    help you retrieve the artifact.</p>
<p>The robot you build will be light, and it will assuredly be
    able to land and jump from any pillar at least once. To build
    the robot, you need to determine how powerful it needs to be in
    terms of its jump distance. If the robot is too weak, then it
    might not be able to reach a pillar. If the robot is too
    strong, then it will cause a lot of damage when jumping and
    landing.</p>
<p>Luckily you have already mapped out where all the pillars
    are located with respect to your starting point at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 0)$</span>. You don’t know yet which
    pillar contains the artifact, and you need to finish building
    the robot first before the scan finishes.</p>
<p>Given the locations of the pillars, you’d like to determine
    the smallest jump distance to guarantee that your robot can
    reach any pillar and return back to the start, without landing
    on a pillar twice.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le n \le 1,000)$</span>, which is the
    number of pillars.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$</span>. These are
    the (<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>,<span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>) coordinates of the pillars. All
    pillar locations will be distinct, and no pillar will be at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 0)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single number, which is the minimum jump distance
    needed to guarantee that a robot could reach any pillar and
    return back to your starting point, without landing on a pillar
    twice. Your answer will be accepted if it has an absolute or
    relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
