<p>Ubol Narongdid is the founder of a brash new startup company
    called Special D-Liver-E. She wants to corner the market on
    overnight deliveries of organs between hospitals in the Phuket
    area. For scheduling purposes it is important to have accurate
    estimates for the times to perform such deliveries. Several
    trips between various hospitals have already been performed, so
    delivery times between those pairs of hospitals are known. The
    company currently has software to estimate times for other (as
    yet untraveled) trips, but so far all the estimates have been
    woefully inaccurate.</p>
<p>You have been asked to come up with a method to improve
    these estimates. You have at your disposal the following
    information: 1) the length (in kilometers) of the roads
    connecting each pair of cities in the Phuket area, and 2) a set
    of times (in minutes) for various previously executed
    deliveries.</p>
<p>You know that roads are one-way, and each road has a fixed
    speed limit that lies between <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span> kilometers per hour. Speed limits
    are real-valued and need not be integers. You also know that
    delivery trucks always take the route that minimizes distance
    traveled, and on each road will always travel at a constant
    speed equal to that roadâ€™s speed limit. Thus you know, for
    example, that if a given trip is <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> kilometers, the time it will take
    is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$50$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> minutes inclusive,
    in the absence of any other information. Ah, but you
    <em>do</em> have other information, namely the times of
    previous deliveries. It is up to you to use it to produce the
    best possible estimates.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \leq 30$</span>) indicating the
    number of cities, numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. After that are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers specifying the distance
    in kilometers between cities: the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{\text {th}}$</span> value on the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> line
    indicates the distance when traveling directly from city
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to city <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>. A value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> indicates there is no road
    directly connecting the two cities, and the distance from any
    city to itself is always <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>; all other distances are positive
    and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>.
    There are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>
    roads.</p>
<p>Following this is a line with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le r \leq 100$</span>) indicating the number of previously
    executed routes. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> lines each contain three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> are the source and destination
    cities and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> is how long
    the delivery from <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> took, in minutes.</p>
<p>Finally there is a line containing a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le q \leq 100$</span>) indicating the
    number of future delivery queries. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines each contain two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> giving the source and destination
    cities for the query.</p>
<p>You may assume that for each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$r+q$</span> source/destination pairs in the
    input there is a unique minimum-distance route.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display a single line for each query containing the source
    and destination cities for that query, followed by the best low
    and high bounds on the estimate for the travel time, accurate
    to within an absolute or relative error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
