<em>The Raffle (Raffling for the Goose)</em> by William
        Sidney Mount, public domain
      </div>
</div>A tremendously exciting raffle is being held, with some
    tremendously exciting prizes being given out. All you have to
    do to have a chance of being a winner is to put a piece of
    paper with your name on it in the raffle box. The lucky winners
    of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> prizes are
    decided by drawing <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>
    names from the box. When a piece of paper with a name has been
    drawn it is not put back into the box â€“ each person can win at
    most one prize.

    <p>Naturally, it is against the raffle rules to put your name
    in the box more than once. However, it is only cheating if you
    are actually caught, and since not even the raffle organizers
    want to spend time checking all the names in the box, the only
    way you can get caught is if your name ends up being drawn for
    more than one of the prizes. This means that cheating and
    placing your name more than once can sometimes increase your
    chances of winning a prize.</p>
<p>You know the number of names in the raffle box placed by
    other people, and the number of prizes that will be given out.
    By carefully choosing how many times to add your own name to
    the box, how large can you make your chances of winning a prize
    (i.e., the probability that your name is drawn exactly
    once)?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le p \le n \le 10^6$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of names in the
    raffle box excluding yours, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is the number of prizes that will
    be given away.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing the maximum possible
    probability of winning a prize, accurate up to an absolute
    error of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
