<div class="problembody">
<p>A mathematical function is something that takes each object
    (like a number) from a set of possible values (called the
    <em>domain</em>), and produces a single object (again, perhaps
    a number) from another set of possible values (called the
    <em>codomain</em>). Functions can be defined over any domain
    and any codomain.</p>
<p>In this problem we will be looking at <em>partial
    functions</em>, which map some subset of the elements of the
    domain to the co-domain. For instance, <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(x) = \sqrt {x}$</span> is a partial
    function but not a function on the domain of real numbers,
    since it only defined for the non-negative numbers.</p>
<p>There are two key properties a partial function may
    have.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>A partial function can be <em>injective</em> (or
        <em>one-to-one</em>), which means that any value in the
        codomain can be produced by at most one value from the
        domain. The function <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(x) =
        x^2$</span> is <em>not</em> injective if we define its
        domain and codomain both as the real numbers (since
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$3^2 = 9$</span>, but also
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$(-3)^2 = 9$</span>).
        However, if we define its domain as the non-negative real
        numbers, then it is injective.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A partial function can be <em>surjective</em> (or
        <em>onto</em>), which means that every value in the
        codomain can be produced by the function. If we define both
        the domain and the codomain of the example <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(x) = x^2$</span> to be all real
        numbers, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(x)$</span>
        is <em>not</em> surjective, because it cannot produce
        negative numbers with the given domain.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If a function is both injective and surjective, then it is
    called <em>bijective</em>. In this problem, we will analogously
    define a partial function to be bijective if it is both
    injective and surjective (but note that this is not standard
    terminology – a more common definition is to drop the
    surjectivity requirement and say that a partial function is
    bijective if it is injective).</p>
<p>Here are visual examples of different types of partial
    functions:</p>

<p>For this problem, write a program which determines if some
    descriptions are partial functions or not. A description is a
    partial function if each object in the domain is associated
    with at most one object in the codomain. For each function,
    determine if it is injective, surjective, bijective, or neither
    injective nor surjective.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains a sequence of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> descriptions. Each description
    starts with two lines that describe the domain and codomain,
    given as space-separated alphanumeric tokens. The words
    “domain” and “codomain” are always the first words on these
    lines and are not part of the sets, they are for readability.
    The next line contains the number of mappings <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq n \leq 40$</span>. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain one
    mapping in the form <tt>x -&gt; y</tt> which indicates that
    <tt>x</tt> from the domain maps to <tt>y</tt> in the codomain
    (<tt>x</tt> and <tt>y</tt> are drawn from the domain and
    codomain for the description). Input ends at end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each description that is a partial function, print
    <tt class="tt">bijective</tt>, <tt class="tt">surjective</tt>,
    <tt class="tt">injective</tt>, or <tt class="tt">neither
    injective nor surjective</tt> depending on what type of partial
    function it is. For each description that is not a partial
    function, print <tt class="tt">not a function</tt>.</p>
