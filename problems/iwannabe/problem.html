<p>In order to become the very best Pokenom trainer, Bash needs
    to prepare a team of Pokenom to participate in the Pokenom
    world championship.</p>
<p>Bash has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> Pokenoms.
    Each Pokenom has <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>
    stats: Attack, Defense and Health. Bash wants to select
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> Pokenoms with highest
    attack, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> Pokenoms with
    highest defense and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    Pokenoms with highest Health.</p>
<p>After selection, Bash found something strange: his team have
    less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \times K$</span>
    Pokenoms!</p>
<p>Bash looks carefully at <span class="tex2jax_process">$N =
    4$</span> Pokenoms he has:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>‘Chikapu’: Attack = <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, Defense = <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, Health = <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Batterfly’: Attack = <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, Defense = <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, Health = <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Mewthree’: Attack = <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span>, Defense = <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span>, Health = <span class="tex2jax_process">$80$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘Dragonon’: Attack = <span class="tex2jax_process">$150$</span>, Defense = <span class="tex2jax_process">$150$</span>, Health = <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When Bash selects Pokenom with <span class="tex2jax_process">$K = 1$</span>, only ‘Mewthree’ and ‘Chikapu’
    are selected! This is because ‘Mewthree’ has highest attack and
    highest defense!</p>
<p>Your task is simple, you are given the stats of all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> Pokenoms and the
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>. Calculate how
    many different Pokenoms are there in Bash’s team.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \le K \le N \le 1\, 000)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
        lines, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line
        contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> integers:
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$H_ i$</span>, representing the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> stats of the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th Pokenom.
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$D_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$H_ i$</span> are unsigned <span class="tex2jax_process">$32$</span>-bit integers.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is guaranteed that no <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> Pokenom have same Attack, no
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> Pokenom have same
    Defense, and no <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    Pokenoms have same Health.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing exactly one integer: the number
    of Pokenom in Bash’s team.</p>
