<p>The old Count von Walken ponders along the fence of his
    backyard. The fence has a repeating pattern with poles in the
    ground at equal distances. Since von Walken has nothing better
    to do, he counts the number of steps he takes between each
    pole.</p>
<p>The distance between two consecutive poles turns out not to
    be an integer multiple of the length of his steps because
    sometimes he takes two steps between the poles, and sometimes
    he takes three steps.</p>

<p>Von Walken knows that his steps are always 1 meter long, so
    he starts thinking of what the distance between the poles may
    be. <em>“It must be more than 2 meters, since I occasionally
    can fit 3 steps between the poles, but it must be less than 3
    meters, since I sometimes only fit 2 steps in
    between.”</em></p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Given a list of step counts and a distance <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>, determine whether it is possible
    that the distance between two poles is <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> meters. The poles can be
    considered to have width <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, and each step is strictly between
    two poles.</p>
<p>To avoid problems with floating point numbers, the result is
    guaranteed to be the same even if any pole is moved up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-7}$</span> meters.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a line containing the real number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> and an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, followed by a line
    with the space-separated list of integer step counts,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1, c_2, \ldots , c_ N$</span>.
    It holds that <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq c_ i, D
    \leq 3$</span> and that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq N
    \leq 10\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The program should print “<tt>possible</tt>” if <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> meters is a possible distance
    between the poles, and “<tt>impossible</tt>” otherwise.</p>
