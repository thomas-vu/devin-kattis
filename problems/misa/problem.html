<p>A nice part of the Roman Catholic Mass is the rite of peace
    when people shake hands with their neighbours and say “peace be
    with you”. Mirko has found a way to turn this ritual into his
    own favor. Inside the church, there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rows of benches where each row can
    hold a capacity of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>
    people. We can imagine the seating order as a matrix sized
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R \times S$</span> where each
    element represents either a person or an empty seating space.
    Let us assume that each person shakes hands with their
    neighbours. That means that the neighbours are located in one
    of the eight neighbouring elements (if such element
    exists):</p>

<p>A seating order of the people inside the church has been
    given before Mirko enters. Mirko is, of course, late for the
    morning Mass and will sit in an empty space so that he shakes
    hands with <em>as many</em> people as he can. If there are no
    empty seats left, Mirko will simply give up on the idea and go
    to the evening Mass instead. We can assume that nobody enters
    the church after Mirko.</p>
<p>Calculate <em>the total number of handshakes</em> given
    during the morning Mass.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq R, S \leq 50$</span>) as stated in the text. Each of the
    following <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> lines
    contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> characters.
    These <span class="tex2jax_process">$R \times S$</span>
    characters represent the seating order. The character “.” (dot)
    represents an empty place and the character “o” (lowercase
    letter o) represents a person.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output should contain the
    required number of handshakes.</p>
