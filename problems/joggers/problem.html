<p>In the woods of Lill-Jansskogen, there is a network of
    trails that are often used by joggers. The trails have been
    much appreciated, and have been specially selected by the
    professors of the Royal Institute of Technology, enabling
    university students to take a short break from their studies
    and refresh their smart minds. Strangely enough, the network of
    trails actually form a tree. When the trails were selected, the
    professors of the university took the set of trails that they
    found in Lill-Jansskogen and created a minimum spanning tree,
    in order to “<em>encourage and inspire computer science
    students to participate in physical activities by applying
    graph theory in the beautiful surroundings of the Royal
    Institute of Technology</em>”.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the computer science students are not that
    brave. Winter is approaching, and it is getting darker and
    darker in the city of Stockholm. Recently, a bunch of
    programmers from CSC (Community of Scared Cowards) have been
    complaining that it is too dark in parts of the trail network
    at night. Some of the trails are lit up by lamps, but sometimes
    that is not enough for the CSC. They would like to see that all
    the trails that they might use are lit up properly!</p>
<p>You have been tasked with satisfying the cowards by placing
    lamps at intersections. For economic reasons, it might not be
    possible to place lights at all intersections, so it will
    suffice to make sure that there is <em>a lamp in at least one
    of the two intersections adjacent to a trail that could
    possibly be used by the joggers</em>. Some intersections
    already have lamps, and of course, you can keep using those
    lamps.</p>
<p>You don’t know exactly what trails the joggers are using,
    but you do know that the joggers will always start and finish
    at the university campus. You also know that joggers are
    training for an upcoming marathon, so they always run exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> meters in total. A
    jogger might turn around at any point in time, even in the
    middle of a trail and she can do so as many times as she wants,
    in order to fulfill the requirement of running exactly
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> meters.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>You will be given a map of the woods and the jogging trails
    included in the minimum spanning tree created by the
    professors. It is guaranteed that there is exactly one route
    between each pair of intersections, where a route is a set of
    adjacent trails. Your task is to find the minimum number of
    additional lamps you needed in order to satisfy the frightened
    runners, no matter which trails they use (subject to the
    restrictions above)</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 50\, 000$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq S \leq 10^4$</span>), the number of intersections and the
    total distance in meters that a jogger wants to run,
    respectively. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> lines with three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a \leq N$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq b \leq N$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq d \leq 100$</span>), meaning that there is a bidirectional
    trail between intersection <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> with length <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> meters. Then follows a line with a
    single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq L \leq N$</span>), the
    number of lamps that have already been placed. Then follow
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> distinct integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell _1, \dots , \ell _
    L$</span> on one line, meaning there is already a lamp placed
    at intersections <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell _1, \dots
    , \ell _ L$</span>. The university campus is at intersection
    number 1.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output contains a single integer, the minimum number of
    additional lamps you need to place in order to satisfy the
    joggers’ requirements.</p>
