<p>Instead of paying attention in class, Luka is killing time
    playing with numbers again. This time, he wrote <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> non-negative integers so that they
    form a ring (circle). After that he formed a new ring by adding
    to each number its two neighbours.</p>
<p>The teacher noticed this and took away the first piece of
    paper, with the original ring. This did not trouble Luka much
    because he knows he can use the other ring to reconstruct the
    original.</p>
<p>Write a program that solves Lukaâ€™s problem.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3
    \le N \le 10\, 000)$</span>, the number of integers in the
    ring.</p>
<p>Each of the following lines contains an integer less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span> (one billion).
    These numbers, in order, form the second ring.</p>
<p>The input will be such that a solution, although not
    necesarily unique, will always exist.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the original ring on <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines. <em>The numbers must be
    non-negative.</em></p>
<p>Rotating the ring is not allowed. For example, the sum of
    the first three output numbers must be equal to the second
    number in the input ring.</p>
<p>Note: the solution need not be unique.</p>
