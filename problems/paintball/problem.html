<p>Marek and his schoolmates have just finished their studies
    at the university. They wanted to celebrate it with a game of
    paintball. After an hour of playing a very strange thing
    happened – everyone had exactly one bullet left. Marek, being a
    very curious person, wanted to know whether it’s possible that
    everyone will be hit exactly once provided nobody moves.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>You are given a description of the situation during a
    paintball game when every player has only one bullet. The
    description of the game consists of pairs of players who can
    see each other. If a player can see another player, he can fire
    at him. Your task is to find a target for each player such that
    everyone will be hit.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two space separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, satisfying
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq N\leq 1\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq M\leq 5\, 000$</span>,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the number of
    players. Players are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1,
    2, \ldots , N$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    lines follow, each line containing two space separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq A &lt; B\leq N$</span>), denoting that
    players <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> can see each other.
    Each pair of players appears at most once in the input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If there is no assignment of targets such that everyone will
    be hit, output <tt class="tt">Impossible</tt>. Otherwise output
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line should contain
    the number of the target of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th player. If there is more than
    one solution, output any one.</p>
