<div class="problembody">
<p>International Connecting Passage Causeway is a long, rutted
    two-way country road crossed by streets at different
    points.</p>
<p>There are many drivers, and each will drive along the
    country road starting at some intersection and ending at some
    other intersection. For each driver, how many intersections
    will they drive through?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2
    \le n \le 10^5)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \le q \le 10^5)$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of cross streets and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> is the number of
    drivers.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains a string of at most ten lowercase letters
    representing the name of one of the streets that crosses the
    country road. All street names are unique. Driving along the
    country road in some direction, one sees these streets in
    exactly the order provided.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>
    lines contains two strings of at most ten lowercase letters
    representing the start and end intersection for each driver.
    Queries will be between distinct streets.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th line containing the
    number of intersections that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th driver drives through.</p>
