<p>It is now far into the future and human civilization is
    ancient history. Archaeologists from a distant planet have
    recently discovered Earth. Among many other things, they want
    to decipher the English language.</p>
<p>They have collected many printed documents to form a
    dictionary, but are aware that sometimes words are not spelled
    correctly (typos are a universal problem). They want to
    classify each word in the dictionary as either correct or a
    typo. Naïvely, they do this using a simple rule: a typo is any
    word in the dictionary such that deleting a single character
    from that word produces another word in the dictionary.</p>
<p>Help these alien archaeologists out! Given a dictionary of
    words, determine which words are typos. That is, which words
    result in another word in the dictionary after deleting a
    single character.</p>
<p>For example if our dictionary is <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ \texttt{hoose}, \texttt{hose},
    \texttt{nose}, \texttt{noises}\} $</span>. Then <tt class="ttfamily">hoose</tt> is a typo because we can obtain
    <tt class="ttfamily">hose</tt> by deleting a single ’<tt class="ttfamily">o</tt>’ from <tt class="ttfamily">hoose</tt>. But
    <tt class="ttfamily">noises</tt> is not a typo because deleting
    any single character does not result in another word in the
    dictionary.</p>
<p>However, if our dictionary is <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ \texttt{hoose}, \texttt{hose},
    \texttt{nose}, \texttt{noises}, \texttt{noise}\} $</span> then
    the typos are <tt class="ttfamily">hoose</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">noises</tt>, and <tt class="ttfamily">noise</tt>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, indicating the number
    of words in the dictionary.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    describe the dictionary. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> of which contains the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> word in
    the dictionary. Each word consists only of lowercase English
    letters. All words are unique.</p>
<p>The total length of all strings is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the words that are typos in the dictionary. These
    should be output in the same order they appear in the input. If
    there are no typos, simply display the phrase <tt class="ttfamily">NO TYPOS</tt>.</p>
