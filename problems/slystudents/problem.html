<p>Students in a boring class want to be able to write notes to
    each other while removing the threat of the teacher knowing
    what they are saying if the teacher happens to get hold of a
    note. Therefore, the students have created a simple way to
    encode their messages. The encoding involves finding the
    largest common factor (divisor) of the ASCII values of the
    characters in each word, something the students call a
    <em>key</em>, and dividing each ASCII value in the word by this
    key. The students then represent each resulting quotient in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{base }3$</span> (without
    leading zeros) to form the final encoded message.</p>
<p>For example, the first word of the message “Fix it” contains
    the ASCII values <span class="tex2jax_process">$70$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$105$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$120$</span>, for ‘F’ ,‘i’, ‘x’,
    respectively. The largest common factor is <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, and therefore the values get
    reduced to <span class="tex2jax_process">$14$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$21$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$24$</span>, and represented in <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{base }3$</span> as <span class="tex2jax_process">$112$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$210$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$220$</span>. The same procedure is then
    applied to the word “it” to yield the <span class="tex2jax_process">$\textrm{base-}3$</span> values <span class="tex2jax_process">$10220$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$11022$</span>.</p>
<p>Create a program that will encode a message, given as a
    single string, using the students’ encoding method.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains a message in the form of a single string
    composed of one or more space-separated words, where each word
    consists of one or more characters with ASCII values in the
    interval <span class="tex2jax_process">$[33, 126]$</span>. The
    total number of characters in the message (including spaces) is
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>, inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each word in the message (in order), output two lines,
    the first of which contains the key for that word, and the
    second of which contains the encoded word. Separate the
    encodings of adjacent letters in a word by a single space.</p>
