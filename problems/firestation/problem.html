<div class="problembody">
<p>A city is served by a number of fire stations. Some
    residents have complained that the distance from their houses
    to the nearest station is too far, so a new station is to be
    built. You are to choose the location of the fire station so as
    to reduce the distance to the nearest station from the houses
    of the disgruntled residents.</p>
<p>The city has up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$500$</span> intersections, connected by road
    segments of various lengths. No more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> road segments intersect at a
    given intersection. The location of houses and firestations
    alike are considered to be at intersections (the travel
    distance from the intersection to the actual building can be
    discounted). Furthermore, we assume that there is at least one
    house associated with every intersection. There may be more
    than one firestation per intersection.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le t \le 100$</span> on a line by itself
    indicating the number of testcases following, each of them as
    described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and
    there is also a blank line between two consecutive inputs.</p>
<p>The first line of each testcase contains two positive
    integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>,the number
    of existing fire stations (<span class="tex2jax_process">$f \le
    100$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, the
    number of intersections (<span class="tex2jax_process">$i \le
    500$</span>). The intersections are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> consecutively. <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> lines follow; each contains the
    intersection number at which an existing fire station is found.
    A number of lines follow, each containing three positive
    integers: the number of an intersection, the number of a
    different intersection, and the length (between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>, inclusive) of the road
    segment connecting the intersections. All road segments are
    two-way (at least as far as fire engines are concerned), and
    there will exist a route between any pair of intersections.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each testcase, the output must follow the description
    below. The outputs of two consecutive cases will be separated
    by a blank line.</p>
<p>You are to output a single integer: the lowest intersection
    number at which a new fire station should be built so as to
    minimize the maximum distance from any intersection to the
    nearest fire station.</p>
