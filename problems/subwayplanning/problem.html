<div class="problembody">
<p>The government in a foreign country is looking into the
    possibility of establishing a subway system in its capital.
    Because of practical reasons, they would like each subway line
    to start at the central station and then go in a straight line
    in some angle as far as necessary. You have been hired to
    investigate whether such an approach is feasible. Given the
    coordinates of important places in the city as well as the
    maximum distance these places can be from a subway station
    (possibly the central station, which is already built), your
    job is to calculate the minimum number of subway lines needed.
    You may assume that any number of subway stations can be built
    along a subway line.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line in the input file contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of data
    sets to follow. Each set starts with two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 500$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le d
    &lt; 150$</span>). <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is
    the number of important places in the city that must have a
    subway station nearby, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is the maximum distance allowed
    between an important place and a subway station. Then comes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each line
    containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-100 \le x, y \le 100$</span>), the
    coordinates of an important place in the capital. The central
    station will always have coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$0,0$</span>. All pairs of coordinates within
    a data set will be distinct (and none will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$0,0$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set, output a single integer on a line by
    itself: the minimum number of subway lines needed to make sure
    all important places in the city are at a distance of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> from a subway
    station.</p>
