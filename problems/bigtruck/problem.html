<p>Your boss has hired you to drive a big truck, transporting
    items between two locations in a city. You’re given a
    description of the city, with locations of interest and the
    lengths of roads between them. Your boss requires that you take
    a shortest path between the starting and ending location, and
    she’ll check your odometer when you’re done to make sure you
    didn’t take any unnecessary side trips. However, your friends
    know you have plenty of unused space in the truck, and they
    have asked you to stop by several locations in town, to pick up
    items for them. You’re happy to do this for them. You may not
    be able to visit every location to pick up everything your
    friends want, but you’d like to pick up as many items as
    possible on your trip, as long as it doesn’t make the path any
    longer than necessary.</p>

<p>The two graphs above show examples of what the city may look
    like, with nodes representing locations, edges representing
    roads and dots inside the nodes representing items your friends
    have asked you to pick up. Driving through a location allows
    you to pick up all the items there; it’s a big truck, with no
    limit on the items it can carry. In the graph on the left, for
    example, you have to drive the big truck from location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>. If you follow the
    path <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow
    3 \rightarrow 6$</span>, the length is <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, and you’ll get to pick up
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> items. Of course, it
    would be better to drive <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 6$</span>; that’s still
    a length of <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, but going
    this way instead lets you pick up an additional item. Driving
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 3
    \rightarrow 6$</span> would let you pick up even more items,
    but it would make your trip longer, so you can’t go this
    way.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq n \leq 100$</span>), giving the number of locations in the
    city. Locations are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, with location <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> being the starting location and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> being the destination.
    The next input line gives a sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1 \ldots t_ n$</span>, where each
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> indicates the
    number of items your friends have asked you to pick up from
    location <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>. All the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span> values are between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, inclusive. The next input line
    contains a non-negative integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, giving the number of roads in the
    city. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines is a description of a road,
    given as three integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a \: b
    \: d$</span>. This indicates that there is a road of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> between location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>. The values of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> are in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \ldots n$</span>, and the value of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, inclusive. All roads can be
    traversed in either direction, there is at most one road
    between any two locations, and no road starts and ends at the
    same location.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>If it’s not possible to travel from location <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to location <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, just output out the word
    “impossible”. Otherwise, output the length of a shortest path
    from location <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    location <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, followed by
    the maximum number of items you can pick up along the way.</p>
