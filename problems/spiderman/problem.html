<p>Staying fit is important for every super hero, and Spiderman
    is no exception. Every day he undertakes a climbing exercise in
    which he climbs a certain distance, rests for a minute, then
    climbs again, rests again, and so on. The exercise is described
    by a sequence of distances <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_1,
    d_2,\ldots , d_ m$</span> telling how many meters he is to
    climb before the first first break, before the second break,
    and so on. From an exercise perspective it does not really
    matter if he climbs up or down at the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>:th climbing stage, but it is
    practical to sometimes climb up and sometimes climb down so
    that he both starts and finishes at street level. Obviously, he
    can never be below street level. Also, he would like to use as
    low a building as possible (he does not like to admit it, but
    he is actually afraid of heights). The building must be at
    least 2 meters higher than the highest point his feet
    reach during the workout.</p>
<p>He wants your help in determining when he should go up and
    when he should go down. The answer must be legal: it must start
    and end at street level (0 meters above ground) and it may
    never go below street level. Among the legal solutions he wants
    one that minimizes the required building height. When looking
    for a solution, you may not reorder the distances.</p>
<p>If the distances are 20 20 20 20 he can either climb
    <span class="sffamily">up, up, down, down</span> or
    <span class="sffamily">up, down, up, down</span>. Both are
    legal, but the second one is better (in fact optimal) because
    it only requires a building of height 22, whereas the first one
    requires a building of height 42. If the distances are 3 2 5 3
    1 2, an optimal legal solution is to go <span class="sffamily">up, up, down, up, down, down</span>. Note that for
    some distance sequences there is no legal solution at all
    (e.g., for 3 4 2 1 6 4 5).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> giving the number of test
    scenarios, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le
    101$</span>. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$2N$</span> lines specify the test scenarios,
    two lines per scenario: the first line gives a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M \leq 40$</span> which is the
    number of distances, and the following line contains the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> positive integer
    distances. For any scenario, the total distance climbed (the
    sum of the distances in that scenario) is at most 1000.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each input scenario a single line should be output. This
    line should either be the string “IMPOSSIBLE” if no legal
    solution exists, or it should be a string of length
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> containing only the
    characters “U” and “D”, where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>:th character indicates if
    Spiderman should climb up or down at the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>:th stage. If there are several
    different legal and optimal solutions, output one of them (it
    does not matter which one as long as it is optimal).</p>
