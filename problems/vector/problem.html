</div>Vector embeddings are a common tool in machine learning
    systems. Complex real-world concepts (for instance, words in a
    dictionary) are mapped onto vectors of real numbers. If
    embeddings are trained properly, related concepts remain close
    together in the vector space, so questions like “are these two
    words synonyms?” can be reduced to straightforward mathematical
    tests.
    <p>You have been hired by Ye Olde Ice Cream Shoppe to create an
    embedding model for flavors, so that when they are out of an
    ice cream flavor they can recommend related flavors to
    customers. After training your embedding on six cloud
    datacenters for four months, you finally had the perfect flavor
    model! You were ready to revolutionize the ice cream industry
    on your street and, dare we say it, your neighborhood! Well,
    until you accidentally dripped some free ice cream on your
    keyboard and deleted half the data. The Shoppe cannot afford
    the 30 billion rubles needed to retrain the model, so you are
    in trouble.</p>
<p>Fortunately, you still have various training results lying
    around. For a given deleted vector, the training data tells you
    how close it was to some known flavor vectors. The closeness of
    vectors <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> is just the standard
    Euclidean distance metric (that is, the length of the vector
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A - B$</span>). Write a tool
    that reconstructs embeddings which are consistent with the
    training results.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq d \leq 500$</span>) is the number of dimensions of the
    vectors, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 500$</span>) is
    the number of training results for a deleted embedding vector
    you want to reconstruct. Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines describes a training result
    using <span class="tex2jax_process">$d + 1$</span> numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, \dots , x_ d$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span>. In a training result,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1, \dots , x_ d$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-100 \leq x_ i \leq
    100$</span>) are the coordinates of a known vector, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq e \leq 5\, 000$</span>) is the
    Euclidean distance from that vector to the deleted one.</p>
<p>Your submission will be tested only with the sample inputs
    given below and inputs generated according to the following
    procedure. First, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> are chosen. Then,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> input vectors and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> output vector, each
    with dimension <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, are
    chosen at random. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$d \cdot (n
    + 1)$</span> coordinates are independent and uniformly
    distributed in the interval <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-100,100]$</span>. Next, the Euclidean
    distance from each input vector to the output vector is
    computed. Finally, the output vector is discarded. Calculations
    use double-precision floating-point numbers. Numbers obtained
    using this procedure appear in the input with <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span> digits after the decimal
    point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> values, the
    coordinates of any vector that has the given distance to each
    training vector with an absolute or relative error of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span>.</p>
