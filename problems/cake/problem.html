<div class="problembody">
<p>Žofka really likes cakes. Her most recent favorite is a
    rectangular-shaped cake with hard chocolate glazing and white
    marzipan roses on top. The glazing has been pre-cut in a
    grid-like pattern at the bakery since this type of glazing is
    difficult to cut after it hardens. The bakers pride themselves
    in creating various creations with the roses—they place every
    rose in the middle of one of the grid squares (at most one rose
    per square) but the placement differs each time. Žofka invited
    her friends to share the cake with her—together with her there
    are as many people as there are roses on the cake as she and
    each of her friends like a piece with a rose. Žofka can cut
    only rectangular pieces of the cake along the grid lines. How
    should she cut the cake so that she and each of her friends
    gets a rectangular piece with a rose and there is the smallest
    possible amount of leftover cake?</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: A possible solution for the sample
          input. The rectangular pieces cover the cake entirely, so
          there are no leftovers. This solution is described in the
          sample output. Note that there are several other correct
          outputs for the sample input.

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$p \times q$</span> are the dimensions of the
    cake and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number
    of roses. Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    follow, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line
    contains the coordinates of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th rose, where the first
    coordinate is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and the second
    coordinate is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>. You may assume
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n +
    1$</span> lines. The first <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines contain four numbers each:
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ j$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ j$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ j$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ j$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a_ j \leq c_ j \leq p$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq b_ j \leq d_ j \leq
    q$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(a_ j, b_
    j)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(c_ j, d_
    j)$</span> correspond to the grid squares at the opposite
    corners of the rectangular piece for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th person. The rectangular pieces
    have to be non-overlapping. The last line contains a single
    number, the area of the leftovers. The area of the leftovers
    should be the smallest possible.</p>
