<p>Marilyn is by far your favourite bartender, because she
    turns every order into a game.</p>
<p>At the bar, there are three small boxes with doors labelled
    A, B, and C. When you buy a drink, Marilyn places the bottle in
    one of the boxes; you don’t know which. Then the following
    ritual unfolds. You point to one of the three doors. Marilyn
    will then smile enigmatically and open one of the other doors,
    showing its contents. You then get to change your original
    decision: maybe you now pick the door Marilyn just opened (in
    particular if you can see the bottle there!), or you stick with
    your first choice, or you pick the remaining door. Whatever you
    finally choose is what you get.</p>
<p>This entire ritual -– you choose, Marilyn opens, you make
    your final decision – is called a <em>round</em>. It’s been a
    long week, so you’ll play <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\,
    000$</span> rounds. You need to get as many drinks as you
    can.</p>
<h2>Interaction</h2>
<p>Your program interacts with Marilyn using standard input and
    output. You start each round by printing your initial choice of
    door, as a single letter on a line:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<em>you</em><span class="tex2jax_process">$\rangle $</span>
<tt>A</tt> – meaning “My initial choice is door A”
    </blockquote>
<p>Now Marilyn will pick one of the other two doors – she may
    be in a good mood and pick the door with a drink behind it, or
    she may pick a door with no drink behind it; she may choose
    randomly, or helpfully, or she may want to deliberately confuse
    you. Being a good bartender, Marilyn knows where the drink is,
    and she knows you well enough to know your strategy, both of
    which she may take into account or not. She’ll print her door
    name, followed by the number of bottles (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>) behind that door. For instance,
    if she chose to open door C, she will truthfully respond
    with either of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><em>marilyn</em><span class="tex2jax_process">$\rangle
        $</span> <tt>C 0</tt> – meaning “Well, wouldn’t you know
        it? There is nothing behind door C.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>marilyn</em><span class="tex2jax_process">$\rangle
        $</span> <tt>C 1</tt> – meaning “Huh. Looks like the bottle
        is behind door C.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We let her output just those two symbols—instead of her
    actual charming, varied, and loquacious banter—to make it easy
    to parse. You’d have to meet her in person for the real
    experience.</p>
<p>After that you print another letter, namely your final
    choice of door. Let’s say you pick door A:</p>
<blockquote class="quote">
<em>you</em><span class="tex2jax_process">$\rangle $</span>
<tt>A</tt> – meaning “I’ll take whatever is behind door A
      now.”
    </blockquote>
<p>Marilyn will respond with one of two lines, depending on
    whether there was a drink behind your final choice of door or
    not. The format is the number of bottles you receive
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>) followed by the door that
    actually concealed the bottle.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><em>marilyn</em><span class="tex2jax_process">$\rangle
        $</span> <tt>1 A</tt> – meaning “Door A was a great choice.
        You’re always so clever. Enjoy your drink.”</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>marilyn</em><span class="tex2jax_process">$\rangle
        $</span> <tt>0 B</tt> – meaning “Oh, what a shame. The
        bottle was actually behind door B.”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> rounds,
    your program must exit. If you end up with at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$600$</span> drinks, no matter
    which strategy Marilyn uses, your program is accepted.
    Otherwise it is judged as <em>wrong answer</em>.</p>
<p>Below is an example of the first three rounds of
    interaction. In each of the rounds, the drink is behind
    door A. You got <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> drinks.</p>
