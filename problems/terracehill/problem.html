<p>All explored mountain terraces in Girotti hills in Charitum
    Montes on the southern Martian hemisphere have a peculiar
    feature – their sizes are approximately equal, and they all lie
    on a hypothetical straight line.</p>
<p>The flat surface of the terraces is ideal for future housing
    development. Unusual configuration of the terraces allows for a
    daring engineering project which will connect some terraces by
    bridges.</p>
<p>Due to relative geological instability in the surrounding
    region, the surface of any two terraces connected by a bridge
    has to be in the same height. Obviously, a bridge between two
    terraces can be built only when the height of all terraces
    between the given two is less than the height of the two
    terraces to be connected.</p>
<p>The engineers of the project want to know the maximum total
    length of all bridges that can be built. To simplify the
    introductory calculations, the following assumptions are made.
    The distance between two neighbour terraces is negligibly
    small, it is considered to be zero in all cases. The width of a
    terrace is considered to be one length unit.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 3 \cdot 10^5$</span>) the number of the terraces.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \dots , a_ N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le ai \le 10^6$</span>) where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span> is the height of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th terrace. The
    heights are given in the order of terraces on the
    (hypothetical) line.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print one integer – the maximum possible total length of all
    bridges.</p>
