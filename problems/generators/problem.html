<p>The volcanic island of Fleeland has never had a proper
    electric net, but finally the administration of the island have
    agreed to build the island’s power plants and network.</p>
<p>On the island’s coast are its <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cities. The administration has
    surveyed the cities and proposed <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> of them as possible locations for
    a power plant, with the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th proposal stating that the
    company can build a plant in city <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span> for cost <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>.</p>
<p>These power plants are very modern and a single plant could
    power the whole island, but the volcano makes building power
    lines across the island a dangerous affair. For <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i &lt; n$</span>, the company can
    build power lines between cities <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+1$</span> for a cost of <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span>, and between cities
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> for a cost of <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ n$</span>. A city will receive power if
    it contains a power plant or is connected to a city with a
    power plant via power lines.</p>
<p>What is the cheapest way to power all the cities on the
    island?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3\leq n \leq 10^5$</span>) and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq m \leq n$</span>), the number of
        cities and the number of possible locations for a power
        plant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
        lines, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th of
        which contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ i$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq c_ i \leq n$</span>)
        and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a_ i \leq
        10^9$</span>), the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th possible location for a
        power plant, and the cost to build it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then follows a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq b_ i \leq 10^9$</span>), the
        costs of building the power lines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The values of <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_{1,\ldots
    ,n}$</span> are unique and given in strictly increasing
    order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimal cost of powering all cities on the
    island.</p>
