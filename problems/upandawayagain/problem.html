        Steve’s Retreat
      </div>
</div>
<p>Another year has passed, and Steve wants to travel to his
    vacation house again! There are still <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> bases located on mountains located
    around his house. Steve is located at mountain <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and his vacation house is at
    mountain <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>.</p>
<p>This year, the Biomes Ski Corporation has built many ski
    lifts between mountains. Steve wants to take the ski lifts
    hoping that he can get a more scenic trip than flying. Steve
    knows that each mountain has a danger level of <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span>, meaning that a mountain with a
    height of <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_ i$</span> is only
    connected via ski lift with a mountain of height <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_ j$</span> if <span class="tex2jax_process">$abs(h_ i - h_ j) \leq d_ j$</span>. However,
    due to low budget, only ski lifts going downwards were built.
    Thus, from a mountain with height <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_ i$</span>, he can only travel to
    mountains with a danger level of <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ j$</span> and height of <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_ j$</span> if <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq h_ i - h_ j \leq d_ j$</span>.</p>
<p>Each ski lift operates with a time of <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> between two mountains. Please help
    Steve figure out the minimum time needed to travel to his
    vacation house, or determine that he can’t reach his house
    using ski lifts!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 10^5, 1 \leq x \leq n, 1 \leq t \leq 10^9$</span>),
    the number of bases, location of the vacation house, and time
    for each ski lift, respectively.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_1, h_2, \ldots , h_ n$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq h_ i \leq 10^5$</span>) is the height
    of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> base’s
    mountain.</p>
<p>The third line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_1, d_2, \ldots , d_ n$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d_ i \leq 10^5$</span>) is the danger
    level of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span>
    base’s mountain.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer that is the minimum time Steve needs
    to travel to his vacation house. Output -1 if he cannot reach
    his vacation house using ski lifts.</p>
