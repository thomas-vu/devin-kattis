<p>Pick up sticks is a fascinating game. A collection of
    coloured sticks are dumped in a tangled heap on the table.
    Players take turns trying to pick up a single stick at a time
    without moving any of the other sticks. It is very difficult to
    pick up a stick if there is another stick lying on top of it.
    The players therefore try to pick up the sticks in an order
    such that they never have to pick up a stick from underneath
    another stick.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> each at least one and no greater
    than one million. The integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of sticks, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number of lines
    that follow. The sticks are numbered from 1 to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. Each of the following lines
    contains a pair of integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, indicating that there is a point
    where stick <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> lies on
    top of stick <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines of
    integers, listing the sticks in the order in which they could
    be picked up without ever picking up a stick with another stick
    on top of it. If there are multiple such correct orders, any
    one will do. If there is no such correct order, output a single
    line containing the word <tt class="ttfamily">IMPOSSIBLE</tt>.</p>
