<p>The “eight queens puzzle” is a classic puzzle where you have
    to place eight queens on a chess board in such a way that no
    queen can attack another queen. Remember that, in chess, queens
    can move in any direction (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal),
    which means the eight queens would have to be laid out in such
    a way that no two queens are on the same row, column, or
    diagonal.</p>
<p>This puzzle actually has multiple solutions. The following
    is one possible solution:</p>

<p>Finding the solutions to the “eight queens puzzle” is
    actually an interesting computational problem. However, that’s
    not the problem you will be solving here. Instead, you will be
    solving a much simpler problem: given a proposed solution to
    the puzzle, you must <em>verify</em> whether it is a valid
    solution (i.e., whether no queen can attack another queen).</p>
<p>When referring to specific squares on the board, we will
    assume that the bottom-left square is the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span> square, and that the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> coordinate increases
    as you move right, and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> coordinate increases as you move
    up.</p>
<p>In other words, something like this:</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth ]{board2.png}" src="/problems/queens/file/statement/en/img-0002.png" style="width:50.00%"/>
</center>
<p>Furthermore, we will consider the more general “<span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>-queens puzzle”, where the
    chessboard can have <span class="tex2jax_process">$N\times
    N$</span> squares, and there will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> queens on the board. For example,
    this would be a <em>correct</em> solution to the 4-queens
    puzzle:</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth ]{small1.png}" src="/problems/queens/file/statement/en/img-0003.png" style="width:30.00%"/>
</center>
<p>And this would be an <em>incorrect</em> solution to the
    4-queens puzzle:</p>
<center>
<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth ]{small2.png}" src="/problems/queens/file/statement/en/img-0004.png" style="width:30.00%"/>
</center>
<p>Notice how the queen in (2,2) can attack the queen in (0,2)
    and the queen in (2,3).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with a line containing a single integer:
    the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; N \le 5\, 000$</span>).
    This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines, each containing the position of a queen as two integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (separated by a single space),
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x, y &lt;
    N$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output contains either <tt class="ttfamily">CORRECT</tt>
    if the positions of the queens is a solution to the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>-queens puzzle, and
    <tt class="ttfamily">INCORRECT</tt> otherwise.</p>
