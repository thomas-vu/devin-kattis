<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several test cases. Each test case
    starts with a line with two non-negative integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le n \le 10\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le 50\, 000$</span>,
    separated by a single space, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the numbers of nodes in the
    graph and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the
    number of edges. Nodes are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>. Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines, each line consisting of two
    (space-separated) integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> indicating that there is an edge
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> in the graph.</p>
<p>Input will be terminated by a line containing <tt class="ttfamily">0 0</tt>, this line should <em>not</em> be
    processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line consisting of a
    space-separated list of the nodes visited by an Eulerian path
    if one exists (if there are multiple Eulerian paths, any one is
    acceptable, so for the second case below, <tt class="ttfamily">1 0 1</tt> is also a valid solution), or the word
    <tt class="ttfamily">Impossible</tt> if no Eulerian path
    exists.</p>
