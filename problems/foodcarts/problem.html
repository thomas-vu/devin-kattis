<p>Peter is in charge of food service on a passenger train. The
    train has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cars ordered
    sequentially starting from the locomotive. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th car has <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> passengers. There are
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> food carts Peter may
    put into service. Each food cart serves a unique type of food.
    The <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th food cart can
    move between the <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_ j$</span>-th
    car and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ j$</span>-th car
    (both inclusive) and serve the passengers in these cars.</p>
<p>The passengers on the train are not only hungry, but also
    adventurous: as long as a food cart is in service, they would
    love to try it! A passenger will be <i class="it">happy</i> if
    he/she sits in a car that is served by all the food carts that
    are in service. Peter would like to design service plans that
    run one or more of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    food carts so that at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> of the passengers on the train are
    happy.</p>
<p>Peter wants to count the number of different service plans
    he may choose from (modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9
    + 7$</span>). Two service plans are different if one food cart
    is put into service in one plan but not in the other plan.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line has three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5, 1 \leq k \leq 10^{14}$</span>).
    The next line has <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    integers. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    integer is <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p_ i \leq 10^9
    $</span>), the number of passengers in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th car. Each of the next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines describes a food
    cart. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th of these
    lines has two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_
    j$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ j$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq l_ j \leq r_ j \leq
    n$</span>), giving the service range of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>-th food cart.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of different service plans, modulo
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9 + 7$</span>.</p>
