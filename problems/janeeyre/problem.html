<p>Anna wants to read the famous book <em>Jane Eyre</em>, but
    annoyingly its title is somewhat late in the alphabet. This is
    a problem, since Anna always reads books in alphabetical order;
    as soon as she finish reading a book, she immediately begins
    reading the next book in her possession which comes first
    according to ASCII-order.</p>
<p>To make matters even worse, Anna often receives new books as
    presents. Such books go into the pile of Anna’s unread books
    (she will finish the book she is currently reading even if the
    received book is earlier in the alphabet). If she receives one
    or more books at the exact same moment as she finishes another
    book, though, then she will pick her next book among both the
    books in her existing pile and the newly received books.</p>
<p>Given Anna’s pile of unread books and a schedule for at
    which points in time Anna’s friends will give her new books,
    can you figure out when she will finish reading <em>Jane
    Eyre</em>? Anna reads at a speed of one page per minute.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line are three non-negative integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>; here <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq n &lt; 100\, 000$</span>) indicates the number of unread
    books in Anna’s pile (in addition to <em>Jane Eyre</em>),
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq m &lt; 100\, 000$</span>) indicates
    the number of books her friends will give her, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq k &lt; 100\, 000$</span>) indicates the number of pages in
    <em>Jane Eyre</em>.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines
    describe the other unread books in Anna’s pile; the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> such line
    contains a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq |s_ i| \leq 20$</span>)
    and a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_
    i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k_ i &lt;
    100\, 000$</span>) indicating respectively the title of the
    book and how many pages it contains. The string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> will be enclosed in double
    quotes (<tt class="ttfamily">"</tt>), and consists of a mixture
    of spaces and alphanumeric ASCII characters.</p>
<p>Finally follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    lines describing the books Anna’s friends will give her; the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j^{\text {th}}$</span> such line
    contains a non-negative integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq t_ j \leq 1\, 000\, 000\,
    000$</span>), a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_
    j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq |s_ j| \leq
    20$</span>) and a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_ j$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k_ j &lt; 100\, 000$</span>)
    indicating respectively the time (in minutes from now) Anna
    will receive the book, the title of the book and how many pages
    it contains. The string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_
    j$</span> will be enclosed in double quotes (<tt class="ttfamily">"</tt>), and consists of a mixture of spaces and
    alphanumeric ASCII characters.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single integer, the minute at which Anna finish reading
    <em>Jane Eyre</em>.</p>
