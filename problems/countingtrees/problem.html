<p>The Great Lord Pooty likes trees and orders his subordinates
    to have them colored black and white. The trees have
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> vertices labeled from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span>, are rooted at vertex
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, and have a peculiar
    structure elaborated on below.</p>
<p>A tree has a fixed branching factor <span class="tex2jax_process">$k \geq 1$</span>, meaning that every vertex
    labeled <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> that is not
    the root (<span class="tex2jax_process">$v &gt; 0$</span>) will
    have vertex <span class="tex2jax_process">$\lfloor
    \frac{v-1}{k}\rfloor $</span> as its parent. For example, if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k = 2$</span>, the tree is a
    complete binary tree.</p>
<p>Then, the tree would have its vertices colored either black
    or white. After every vertex is colored, <b class="bfseries">all edges connecting vertices of different colors
    will be removed</b>, resulting in a forest with many trees. We
    call a coloring <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>-good,
    if the final result is a forest with <em>exactly</em>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> trees.</p>
<p>The Great Lord would like to ask you: given a tree of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> vertices with
    branching factor <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, how
    many <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>-good coloring is
    possible? Note that two colorings are considered different if
    and only if there exists a vertex that is colored
    differently.</p>
<p>Since the answer can be huge, output it modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{10} + 3233 = 10\, 000\, 003\,
    233$</span>.</p>
<p>Of course, one tree is too simple. Since you had boldly
    claimed you are the smartest one in His Empire, Lord Pooty, in
    all his magnificent glory, demands you to answer for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> trees or face a
    gruesome end under his fist of absolute terror.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>, denoting the number
    of test cases (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C \leq
    200\, 000$</span>).</p>
<p>Each test case consists of three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, denoting the number of vertices
    of the tree, the branching factor, and the number of trees in
    the resulting forest (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq
    n,k,c \leq 10^{18}$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output a line containing the number of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>-good colorings of the
    tree, modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000\, 003\,
    233$</span>.</p>
