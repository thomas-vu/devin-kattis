<div class="problembody">
<p>The Production Manager of a dance company has been tasked
    with determining the cost for the seasonal dance recital.
    Because of their exceptional skills, many dancers will perform
    in more than one routine, but this presents a problem; each
    dance routine incorporates a unique costume, so between
    routines, dancers must report backstage to a Wardrobe
    Specialist, who can change the dancer’s costume in time to
    begin their next scheduled routine.</p>
<p>A Wardrobe Specialist does a <i class="itshape">normal
    change</i> on a dancer when the dancer performs in two routines
    that are not consecutive, but when a dancer is required to
    perform in two consecutive routines, a <i class="itshape">quick
    change</i> is necessary. A Wardrobe Specialist charges a flat
    rate per recital that covers all normal changes, but charges an
    exorbitant amount for each quick change. The Production Manager
    is responsible for keeping the show under budget, and has hired
    you to write a program to report the minimum number of quick
    changes needed for a given recital, given that the order of the
    dance routines could be changed.</p>
<p>To describe the cast of dancers that are to perform during a
    recital, each dancer is assigned an identifying uppercase
    letter. (Fortunately, there are never more than 26 dancers, so
    characters from <tt class="tt">A</tt> to <tt class="tt">Z</tt>
    suffice.) To describe a full recital, a list of individual
    routines is given, with a string of characters defining which
    dancers appear in a routine. For example, consider the
    following recital description:</p>
<pre>
    ABC
    ABEF
    DEF
    ABCDE
    FGH
</pre>
<p>The above list describes a recital with 5 dance routines,
    including a total of 8 individual performers (dancers
    <tt class="tt">A</tt> through <tt class="tt">H</tt>). The first
    routine listed includes dancers <span class="mbox" style="width:">{<tt class="tt">A</tt>, <tt class="tt">B</tt>, and
    <tt class="tt">C</tt>}</span>. The second routine includes
    dancers <span class="mbox" style="width:">{<tt class="tt">A</tt>, <tt class="tt">B</tt>, <tt class="tt">E</tt>, and
    <tt class="tt">F</tt>}</span>. Notice that if these first two
    routines are performed in the above order, dancers <tt class="tt">A</tt> and <tt class="tt">B</tt> will require a quick
    change between the routines. In fact, if these five routines
    are scheduled in the order given above, a total of six quick
    changes are required. However, the schedule can be rearranged
    as follows:</p>
<pre>
    ABEF
    DEF
    ABC
    FGH
    ABCDE
</pre>
<p>In this case, only two quick changes are required (those for
    <tt class="tt">E</tt> and <tt class="tt">F</tt> between the
    first two dances).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq R \leq 10$</span>, that indicates the
    number of routines in the recital. Following that will be
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> additional lines, each
    describing the dancers for one routine in the form of a
    nonempty string of up to 26 non-repeating, lexicographically
    sorted uppercase alphabetic characters identifying the dancers
    who perform in that routine. Although a dancer’s letter will
    not appear more than once in a single routine, that dancer may
    appear in many different routines, and it may be that two or
    more routines have the identical set of dancers.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer designating the minimum number of
    quick changes required for the recital.</p>
