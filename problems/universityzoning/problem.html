<div class="problembody">
<p>In an effort to contain a recent pandemic, a certain
    university has decided to implement a zoning system. The school
    campus is a rectangular plot of land and is divided into a grid
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rows and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> columns. Rows and
    columns are numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> respectively. The top-most row is
    the first row, and the left-most column is the first column.
    Each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> faculties
    has been allocated some grid cells. For convenience, each of
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> faculties have
    unique code numbers from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> inclusive. Cells belong to at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> faculty.</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> students, each with
    unique student number <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>,
    have enrolled in the university. Within a faculty, the student
    with the smallest student number will occupy the top-most
    unoccupied cell. If there are ties, the left-most available
    cell will be assigned to that student. This repeats for the
    student with the next smallest student number, until every
    student within that faculty has been assigned to a cell. Every
    faculty has enough spots for its enrolled students, and has at
    least one enrolled student.</p>
<p>On the first day of school, students were found to be in
    random cells all over the campus. Some cells might even contain
    more than one student! You are the safety officer, and have
    been given the following task: There must be at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$G$</span> faculties with their
    compliance target met. A compliance target is met if there is
    at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> students
    found in their assigned cells. Every faculty has an assigned
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> value. To complete the
    task, you will instruct students to move to their assigned
    cells. Students can take <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> step to move to any of the four
    adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), can occupy cells
    belonging to other faculties, can occupy the same cell as other
    students and can walk past other students if necessary. If a
    student is in their assigned cell, that student is counted as
    being in their assigned cell, even if there are other students
    currently occupying it. What is the minimum number of steps the
    students have to take in order for you to complete your
    task?</p>
<p>Refer to the diagrams below for clarification on how the
    assignment works for the sample inputs.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains five integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le R \le 10^9$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le C \le 10^9$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le F \le 10^2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le S \le 10^5$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le G \le F$</span>. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> lines describes the cells assigned
    to each faculty, from faculty <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to faculty <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> in ascending order. Each of the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span> lines contains an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le K \le 10^3$</span>
    the number of cells assigned to that faculty. The rest of the
    line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> integer
    pairs <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_1\; c_1\; r_2\; c_2\;
    \ldots \; r_ k\; c_ k$</span>, each <span class="tex2jax_process">$r\; c$</span> pair describing the row and
    column coordinates of a cell allocated to that faculty. The
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> lines contain
    four integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$r\; c$</span>,
    the coordinates of each of the students on the first day,
    student number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le D \le
    10^9$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>, the
    faculty that student is enrolled in. All cell coordinates lie
    inside the school boundaries. The final line contains the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> values (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq T \leq E$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> is the total number of students
    enrolled in that faculty) for each faculty, from faculty
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to faculty
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$F$</span>.</p>
