<div class="problembody">
<p>Ante and Goran are preparing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> teams of young ambitious students
    for a student programming competition of students from
    University of Zagreb. Both of them have one algorithm they
    <em>have to explain to each team</em>. Of course, both can’t
    work with the same team at the same time and none of them can
    work with multiple teams simultaneously.</p>
<p>You are given the time it takes for each team to understand
    and implement an algorithm. Each algorithm lecture has to be
    done without interruption. Determine the minimal time required
    for Ante and Goran to do their lectures!</p>
<p>For additional explanation, consult the sample test
    clarifications.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the number of teams.</p>
<p>The following line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space separated integers, where
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th integer denotes
    the time required for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th team to understand and
    implement an algorithm.</p>
<p>All numbers in the input belong to the interval <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1, 3 \cdot 10^5]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the required
    number from the task.</p>
<p><b class="bfseries">Clarification of the first example</b>:
    Each team needs <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> units
    of time to understand and implement an algorithm. One of the
    possible schedules is that Ante gives his lectures to team
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, team <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and team <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, respectively, and Goran to team
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, team <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and team <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, respectively.</p>
<p><b class="bfseries">Clarification of the second example</b>:
    One of the optimal schedules is that Ante gives lectures to
    team <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, team
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and team <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, respectively, but with a pause
    lasting <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> unit of time
    between team <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and team
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. Goran will give
    lectures to team <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, team
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and team <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, respectively.</p>
