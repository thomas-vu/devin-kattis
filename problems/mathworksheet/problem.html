<div class="problembody">
<p>You are an elementary school student and you have been asked
    to solve a bunch of simple problems. You have to report your
    results in a nice pretty table. Of course, being a budding
    computer scientists, you are not going to solve these problems
    yourself; you are going to get a machine to do it for you.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to 100 test cases. Each starts with a
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 50$</span>
    giving the number of math problems in the test case. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain a
    math problem of the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$x +
    y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x - y$</span> or
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x * y$</span>. All values for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> are integers in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-10000,10000]$</span>. The end
    of all test cases is marked with a value of zero for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print a table of the results, with
    individual values right justified in their fields. Your results
    should be printed in row major order with a single space
    between each pair of adjacent output columns. The number of
    columns should be chosen to be as large as possible without
    exceeding a line length of 50 characters. All field widths
    within a test case should be the same and should be chosen to
    be large enough to accommodate the longest result in the table.
    Do not print any trailing spaces. Output one blank line between
    the the outputs for adjacent test cases.</p>
