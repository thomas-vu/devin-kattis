<p>Darth Vader is back to his favourite hobby: destroying
    planets (or their population to be precise). He just discovered
    that the rebel leadership has gathered at a planet named
    Watooine, so he must act quickly to eliminate the threat.
    Unfortunately, the Empire is in a pretty bad recession right
    now, so there aren’t any Death Stars left around. Therefore,
    Vader’s plan involves dropping several containers with deadly
    viruses onto the planet’s surface.</p>
<p>To make things simpler for you, we will model this problem
    in 2D. Watooine has radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and is centred at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span>. There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> Empire spaceships, each of which
    will simultaneously launch a rocket with a container towards
    point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 0)$</span>. Once the
    rocket hits the surface of the planet, a virus will start
    spreading along the surface in the shape of a circle of ever
    increasing radius. Since we are modelling the problem in 2D,
    the virus spreads from the point of impact at the same rate in
    both directions, clockwise and counterclockwise along the
    circumference of the circle that represents the surface of the
    planet. Each spaceship has a custom rocket speed, and each
    virus has a custom spread speed. Note that each virus spreads
    along the surface of the planet—it cannot pass through the
    planet to reach the other end.</p>
<p>Your task is to determine how much time will it take for
    Watooine to become completely infected—i.e., every point on the
    planet surface has been reached by a virus. Good luck!</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the number of test cases,
    followed by the descriptions of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases. Each test case
    description has the following structure: The first line
    contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>,
    the radius of the planet (in meters), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, the number of spaceships. The
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> lines each
    contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> integers: the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>-coordinate of the
    ship, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>-coordinate
    of the ship, the rocket speed and the virus spread speed (in
    meters per second). It is guaranteed that no ships are inside
    the planet.</p>
<p>Both speeds are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span>, both coordinates are
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1\, 000\, 000$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> is between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print one line containing one real
    number, the time it takes for the planet to become completely
    infected. Your answer will be considered correct if it is
    within <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-4}$</span> from the
    jury answer.</p>
