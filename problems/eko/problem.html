<div class="problembody">
<p>Lumberjack Mirko needs to chop down <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> metres of wood. It is an easy job
    for him since he has a nifty new woodcutting machine that can
    take down forests like wildfire. However, Mirko is only allowed
    to cut a single row of trees.</p>
<p>Mirko’s machine works as follows: Mirko sets a height
    parameter <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> (in metres),
    and the machine raises a giant sawblade to that height and cuts
    off all tree parts higher than <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> (of course, trees not higher than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> meters remain intact).
    Mirko then takes the parts that were cut off. For example, if
    the tree row contains trees with heights of <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$17$</span> metres, and Mirko raises his
    sawblade to <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> metres,
    the remaining tree heights after cutting will be <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> metres, respectively, while Mirko
    will take <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> metres off
    the first tree and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    metres off the fourth tree (<span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> metres of wood in total).</p>
<p>Mirko is ecologically minded, so he does not want to cut off
    more wood than necessary. That is why he wants to set his
    sawblade as high as possible. Help Mirko find the maximum
    integer height of the sawblade that still allows him to cut off
    at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> metres of
    wood.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two space-separated
    positive integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (the number of trees, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N
    \le 1\, 000\, 000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (Mirko’s required wood amount,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le M \le 2\, 000\, 000\,
    000$</span>).</p>
<p>The second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space-separated non-negative
    integers less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\,
    000\, 000$</span>, the heights of each tree (in metres). The
    sum of all heights will exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, thus Mirko will always be able to
    obtain the required amount of wood.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first and only line of output must contain the required
    height setting.</p>
