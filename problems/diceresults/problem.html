<div class="problembody">
<p>You are given a set of dice which will be thrown. Each die
    has some number of sides <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> and all sides are equally likely
    to be the result when the die is thrown. If a die has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> sides the numbers on
    the sides are <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, \dots ,
    H$</span>. Find the probability distribution of the sum of all
    thrown dice.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of dice.
    On the next line there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h_1, h_2, \dots , h_n$</span> which give the
    number of sides of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    dice. You may assume that the highest possible result of
    throwing all dice is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \cdot 10^5$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each result from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to the maximum roll, print the
    number of ways to achieve that result. Since this number might
    be very large, print it modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$998\, 244\, 353$</span>.</p>
