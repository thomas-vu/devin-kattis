<p>An infinite full binary tree labeled by positive rational
    numbers is defined by:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The label of the root is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1/1$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The left child of label <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/(p+q)$</span>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The right child of label <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span> is <span class="tex2jax_process">$(p+q)/q$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The top of the tree is shown in the following figure:</p>

<p>A rational sequence is defined by doing a level order
    (breadth first) traversal of the tree (indicated by the light
    dashed line). So that:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ F(1)
    = 1/1, F(2) = 1/2, F(3) = 2/1, F(4) = 1/3, F(5) = 3/2, F(6) =
    2/3, \ldots \]</span>
<p>Write a program which takes as input a rational number,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p/q$</span>, in lowest terms and
    finds the next rational number in the sequence. That is, if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$F(n) = p/q$</span>, then the
    result is <span class="tex2jax_process">$F(n+1)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P \le 1000$</span>), which is the
    number of data sets that follow. Each data set should be
    processed identically and independently.</p>
<p>Each data set consists of a single line of input. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, which is then followed by a
    space, then the numerator of the fraction, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, followed immediately by a forward
    slash (/), followed immediately by the denominator of the
    fraction, <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span>. Both
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> will be relatively prime and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le p, q \le 2\, 147\, 483\,
    647$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each data set there is a single line of output. It
    contains the data set number, <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, followed by a single space which
    is then followed by the numerator of the fraction, followed
    immediately by a forward slash (<tt class="ttfamily">/</tt>)
    followed immediately by the denominator of the fraction. Inputs
    will be chosen such that neither the numerator nor the
    denominator will overflow a 32-bit integer.</p>
