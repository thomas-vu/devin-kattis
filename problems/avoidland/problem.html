<p>Avoidland is a puzzle played on an <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \times n$</span> board with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> pawns. The pawns are initially
    placed on the squares of the board, at most one pawn per
    square. The goal is to move the pawns so that they “avoid” each
    other—there cannot be a row or a column with more than one
    pawn. In one move a pawn can move to a neighboring unoccupied
    square, that is, a square that shares a side with the pawn’s
    current location and there is no pawn on it. Given the initial
    locations of the pawns, what is the minimum number of moves
    needed to solve the puzzle?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines follow. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line contains the initial row
    and column coordinates of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th pawn, separated by space. Each
    coordinate is an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The line contains the minimum number of moves needed to
    solve the puzzle.</p>
