<p>Like all other good drivers, you like to curse, swear and
    honk your horn at your fellow automobile drivers. Today you’re
    at the rear of a long line, brooding over the others’ inability
    to keep proper distance to the car in front. But are you really
    keeping your own distance?</p>
<p>You have calculated that in order to never have to use your
    breaks, you must keep a distance to any car <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> in front of you at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p(n+1)$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of cars
    between you and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is an integer constant
    determined by which of your cars you are currently driving.</p>
<p>Given the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>
    and the current distances (in random order) to each of the cars
    ahead of you, calculate the minimum distance you <i class="itshape">should</i> be keeping to the car directly in front,
    in order to not have to use your breaks.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>First a line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n
    \leq 100\, 000$</span> – the number of cars ahead of you – and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p \leq 20$</span> – the
    deceleration constant.</p>
<p>Then a single line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> unique integers denoting the
    current distance to each of the cars ahead of you. Each of
    these integers are in the interval <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1, 10^7]$</span><br/></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The minimum distance you must keep to the car directly in
    front, in order to not have to use your breaks.</p>
