<p>Golomb Industries is designing their new office building
    following modern principles that allow for flexible,
    reconfigurable meeting spaces. Their plans include a very wide
    rectangular room, with a series of optional parallel
    partitions.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: An example of a configurable space
      </div>
</div>
<p>Figure 1 illustrates such a room having a width of
    10 units and three optional partitions located 1 unit, 4
    units, and 8 units away from the left wall of the room. The
    width of the room always measures the distance between the left
    and right walls, and partitions always run parallel to these
    walls. We do not concern ourselves with the depth of the
    room.</p>
<p>For this example, if no partitions are used, a meeting can
    be held in the original space having width 10. If the company
    needs a space that is precisely 4 units wide, they can use
    the portion of the room between the left wall and a partition
    placed at location 4 (or they could use the portion
    between the partitions at locations 4 and 8). To provide a
    space having width 7 they can use the portion of the room
    between the partitions placed at locations 1 and 8
    (omitting the partition at location 4).</p>
<p>Given a particular room design, your job is to determine all
    feasible widths for a meeting.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains two integers: the
    overall width <span class="tex2jax_process">$W$</span> of
    the room, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq W \leq
    100$</span>, and the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> of intermediate partitions, such
    that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq P &lt; W$</span>.
    Following that is a line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> integers, each designating the
    location <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> of an
    optional partition, such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; L &lt; W$</span>. Each partition is at a distinct location
    and the partitions’ locations will be listed in increasing
    order.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Your program should output a list, from smallest to largest,
    of each distinct width that can be achieved for a meeting
    space.</p>
