<div class="problembody">
<p>The Dutch political system is in turmoil. There have been
    six coalition governments in the past fourteen years, all of
    which have fallen before completing their term in office.
    Recently there have been elections (again), the outcome of
    which has been described as “impossible” by several political
    commentators. The only bright spot in this bleak situation is
    that they have appointed <em>you</em> as the “informateur”. As
    the informateur it is your task to find a suitable
    coalition.</p>
<p>Being the rational person you are, you have decided the
    first negotiation attempt should be started between the parties
    forming the <em>most stable coalition</em>. A coalition is
    formed by a set of parties having won a strict majority of
    seats in the election (i.e. at least 76 seats out of a
    total of 150). The most stable coalition is one that has the
    highest chance of completing its term in office. A coalition
    falls (and new elections must be held) if a single party leaves
    the coalition. The probability of a coalition completing their
    term is estimated by the product of the probabilities of each
    party in the coalition completing their term. This probability
    is in turn based on historical data.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 150$</span>), the number
        of political parties that have won at least one seat in the
        election.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        with two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$s_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s_ i \leq 150$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p_ i \leq
        100$</span>): the number of seats won by the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th party and the probability
        (expressed as a percentage) that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th party will complete its
        term in office, respectively.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that there are exactly 150 seats divided among all
    parties <span class="tex2jax_process">$\left(\sum \limits
    _{i=1}^ n s_ i = 150\right)$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a floating point number: the probability
        (expressed as a percentage) of the most stable coalition
        sitting out their term in office.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This number should be accurate up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> relative or absolute
    precision.</p>
