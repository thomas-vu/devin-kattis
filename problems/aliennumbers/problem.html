<p>The decimal numeral system is composed of ten digits, which
    we represent as "0123456789" (the digits in a system are
    written from lowest to highest). Imagine you have discovered an
    alien numeral system composed of some number of digits, which
    may or may not be the same as those used in decimal. For
    example, if the alien numeral system were represented as "oF8",
    then the numbers one through ten would be (F, 8, Fo, FF, F8,
    8o, 8F, 88, Foo, FoF). We would like to be able to work with
    numbers in arbitrary alien systems. More generally, we want to
    be able to convert an arbitrary number thatâ€™s written in one
    alien system into a second alien system.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input gives the number of cases,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T\leq 100$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases follow. Each case is a
    line formatted as</p>
<pre>
alien_number source_language target_language
</pre>
<p>Each language will be represented by a list of its digits,
    ordered from lowest to highest value. No digit will be repeated
    in any representation, all digits in the alien number will be
    present in the source language, and the first digit of the
    alien number will not be the lowest valued digit of the source
    language (in other words, the alien numbers have no leading
    zeroes). Each digit will either be a number 0-9, an uppercase
    or lowercase letter, or one of the following symbols
    <tt>!"#$%&amp;'()*+,-./:;&lt;&gt;?@[\]^_`{|}~</tt></p>
<p>You may assume that the number in decimal is positive and at
    most 1000000000. All languages will have at most 94 digits.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing "Case
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>: " followed by the
    alien number translated from the source language to the target
    language.</p>
