<p>Over the years, Grandpa Bernie has traveled all over the
    world. He doesn’t travel that much anymore, but he loves to
    tell his grandchildren stories from all these trips. He’ll tell
    them the story from when he went to Israel for the first time,
    or when he went to Greece for the third time.</p>
<p>His memory works in a funny way. He can easily remember his
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>:th trip to a
    particular country, but he’ll have a hard time remembering in
    which year he went on that trip. Given a list of all the trips
    Grandpa Bernie went on, can you answer a number of queries
    asking in which year he went on his <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>:th trip to a particular
    country?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>one line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$</span>), the number
        of trips Grandpa Bernie went on;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
        containing the name <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq |s| \leq 20$</span>) of a country
        and an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq y \leq 10^6$</span>)
        representing a trip to country <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> that Grandpa Bernie went on in
        year <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq q \leq 10^5$</span>), the number
        of queries;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> lines each
        containing the name <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> of a country and an integer
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> representing a
        query for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>:th
        time Grandpa Bernie went to country <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each country name only consists of letters from the English
    alphabet. It is also guaranteed that, for each query asking for
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>:th trip to country
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> is at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and no greater than the number of
    times Grandpa Bernie went to country <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>. In particular, it is guaranteed
    that Grandpa Bernie has visited country <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> at least once.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query for the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>:th trip Grandpa Bernie went to a
    country <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, output a
    single line containing the year in which Grandpa Bernie went on
    that trip.</p>
