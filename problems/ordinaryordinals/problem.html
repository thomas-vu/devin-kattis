<p>Sets, sets, sets. Everything in math is just a set. Even the
    natural numbers can be represented as sets. For example, we can
    represent the the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> as the empty set <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ \} $</span>. The number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> can be represented as <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ \{ \} \} $</span>.</p>
<p>But what about <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>?
    Consider <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ \{ \} , \{ \{ \} \}
    \} $</span>, the set containing both the empty set and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ \{ \} \} $</span>. This is a
    nice choice for <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> for
    two reasons: we have that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> are <em>elements</em> of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and we also have that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> are <em>subsets</em> of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.</p>
<p>In general, for <span class="tex2jax_process">$N&gt;0$</span> we can represent <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> as the set <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 0, 1, \ldots , N-1\} $</span> where we
    recursively apply the representations for <span class="tex2jax_process">$0, \ldots , N-1$</span>. For
    example:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{eqnarray*} 3
    &amp; = &amp; \{ 0, 1, 2\} \\ &amp; = &amp; \{ \{ \} , \{ 0\} ,
    \{ 0, 1\} \} \\ &amp; = &amp; \{ \{ \} , \{ \{ \} \} , \{ \{ \}
    , \{ 0\} \} \} \\ &amp; = &amp; \{ \{ \} , \{ \{ \} \} , \{ \{
    \} , \{ \{ \} \} \} \} \end{eqnarray*}</span>
<p>Thus, for each <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq i &lt;
    N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is both a
    member of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and a subset
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. Another nice
    feature is the size of the set representing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is also <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. But what is not so nice is the
    number of characters it takes to write such a set. Given a
    natural number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \geq 0$</span>,
    how many braces and commas are required to write out the set
    representing <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> in the
    above manner?</p>
<p>More specifically, let <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(N)$</span> be the number of bracket and
    comma characters required to write out the set representing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. Since <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(N)$</span> can be quite large, your job is
    to determine <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(N)$</span> modulo
    some positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq N &lt; 2^{63}$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq M &lt; 2^{31}$</span>) as described above.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Display the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(N)$</span> reduced modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>. That is, the remainder that would
    be left if you divided <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(N)$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>.</p>
