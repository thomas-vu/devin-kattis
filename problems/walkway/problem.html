<div class="problembody">
<p>You are planning to place a small, prefabricated gazebo in
    your back yard, with a paved walkway connecting it to your back
    porch. You’ll build the walkway out of paving stones purchased
    at your local home improvement store. The paving stones come in
    a variety of sizes, but they are all shaped like isosceles
    trapezoids. As illustrated on the left of Figure 1, an
    isosceles trapezoid is what you get if you take an isosceles
    triangle and cut off a corner with a line that is parallel to
    the base. We can describe such a paving stone with three
    parameters: the length of one of its parallel edges,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, the length of the
    other parallel edge, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>,
    and the perpendicular distance, <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>, between these edges.</p>

      </div>
</div>
<p>You’re going to build your walkway by joining the parallel
    edges of the paving stones, with one parallel edge meeting the
    back porch at the start and another meeting the gazebo at the
    end. You want your walkway to look nice, so you won’t permit
    any of the situations illustrated on the right of
    Figure 1. Where two paving stones meet, their edges must
    be exactly the same length. Likewise, where a paving stone
    meets the back porch or the gazebo, its edge must be exactly
    the same length. Fortunately, your home improvement store has a
    wide selection of different trapezoid-shaped paving stones, so
    you are confident you can build a walkway that satisfies these
    requirements.</p>
<p>Paving stones are priced at two cents per square centimeter
    of surface area. You have a big back yard, so you don’t care
    how long your walkway is. You just want the one that’s the
    least expensive.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input will consist of multiple test cases. Each test case
    will start with a positive integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of different types of
    paving stones available. The value, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, will be at least 1 and no greater
    than 1000. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines each describe a type of stone by giving the lengths of
    its sides, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> then <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>. These three values will be
    positive integers, measured in centimeters and not greater than
    1000. No two types of stones are identical, but your home
    improvement store has a large stock of paving stones, so you
    can buy as many of each type as you need. The last line of each
    test case gives the width of the back porch, where the walkway
    will start, followed by the width of the edge of the gazebo
    where the walkway will end. A value of zero for <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> will mark the end of all test
    cases.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print the total cost, in dollars, for
    the least expensive walkway that meets your requirements. It
    will always be possible to build such a walkway.</p>
