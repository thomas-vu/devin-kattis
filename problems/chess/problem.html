<p>In chess the bishop is the chessman, which can only move
    diagonal. It is well known that bishops can reach only fields
    of one color but all of them in some number of moves (assuming
    no other figures are on the field). You are given two
    coordinates on a chess-field and should determine, if a bishop
    can reach the one field from the other and how. Coordinates in
    chess are given by a letter (’A’ to ’H’) and a number (1 to 8).
    The letter specifies the column, the number the row on the
    chessboard.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with the number of test cases. Each test
    case consists of one line, containing the start position
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and end position
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>. Each position is
    given by two space separated characters. A letter for the
    column and a number for the row. There are no duplicate test
    cases in one input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line for every test case. If it’s not possible to
    move a bishop from <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> in any number of moves
    output ’<tt class="tt">Impossible</tt>’. Otherwise output one
    possible move sequence from <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>. Output the number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> of moves first (allowed to be
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> at most). Followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n + 1$</span> positions, which
    describe the path the bishop has to go. Every character is
    separated by one space. There are many possible solutions. Any
    with at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> moves
    will be accepted. Remember that in a chess move one chessman
    (the bishop in this case) has to change his position to be a
    valid move (i.e. two consecutive positions in the output
    must differ).</p>
