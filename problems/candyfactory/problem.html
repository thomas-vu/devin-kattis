<p>The International Consortium of Popular Candies (ICPC) is
    hosting a prestigious candy festival for candy lovers
    worldwide. The consortium has asked <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> candy factories to produce candies
    for the event. Each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> factories has produced some
    quantity of a unique type of candy.</p>
<p>Packs of candies will be given to the participants at the
    festival. A candy pack must consist of exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> candies of different types. Two
    candy packs may contain different sets of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> candies.</p>
<p>There may be unavoidably some leftover candies given the
    quantities of candies that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> factories have already produced.
    The ICPC does not want to waste any of the candies produced,
    and is willing to create extra packs of candy to ensure this.
    The ICPC can order any of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> factories to produce additional
    candies. What is the minimum quantity of additional candies
    that must be ordered, so that there will be no leftover candies
    after packing?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input has two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq k \leq n \leq 5\, 000$</span>).</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    have a single integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>. The integer on the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> line is
    the quantity of candies that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{\text {th}}$</span> factory has
    produced.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the minimum quantity of additional
    candies that must be ordered.</p>
