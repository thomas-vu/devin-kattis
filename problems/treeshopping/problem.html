<p>Andy is going holiday shopping and needs to buy several
    Christmas trees. At the store, there is a row of Christmas
    trees of various heights. Andy is only allowed to buy trees
    that are next to each other, i.e. trees that are contiguous
    within the row. He also wants to make sure that the shortest
    tree he buys and the tallest tree he buys are as close in
    height as possible. What is the smallest height difference he
    can get given the constraints?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of two lines. The first line contains two
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq k \leq n \leq 200\, 000$</span>),
    representing the number of trees in the row and the number of
    trees Andy needs to buy, respectively. The second line consists
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_1, a_2, \ldots , a_ n$</span>
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq a_ i \leq
    100$</span>, representing the height of each tree.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum height difference between the shortest
    and tallest trees of any contiguous subrange of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> trees.</p>
