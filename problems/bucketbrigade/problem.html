<div class="problembody">
<p>You are at one end of a line of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> people. You and the other
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> people are holding
    one bucket each, each with a capacity of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> liters. You want to move a total
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> liters of water
    from a large tub next to you to a similar tub at the other end
    of the line. You use your bucket to take water from the tub on
    your end, turn to the person beside you, pour the contents of
    your bucket into his and then turn back to the tub and repeat
    the process. Similarly, each person transfers the contents of
    his or her bucket to the people beside them, with the last
    person emptying her bucket into the tub at their end. You want
    to move the water as efficiently as possible. At the same time,
    you don’t want to end up with one bucket (the last one) that is
    almost empty. Instead, you determine the minimum number of
    bucket loads sufficient to transfer the water, and then you
    distribute the water evenly so that, each time you draw a
    bucket from your tub, you take exactly the same amount out.</p>
<p>Buckets can be filled and emptied at a rate of <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> liters per second, whether they
    are filled from another bucket, from a tub or emptied into a
    tub. It takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> seconds
    to turn to the left or the right, and everyone starts out
    turned toward you, ready to receive the first bucket load.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> test cases, one per line. Each
    test case gives the values of the five parameters: the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>), followed by
    real values for <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le v \le 2\, 000$</span>),
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; x \le 10$</span>), <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; f \le 5$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; t \le 2$</span>). Each real value has up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> digits past the decimal. It’s
    guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$|\lfloor v / x
    \rfloor - v / x| &gt; 10^{-5}$</span>. Input ends at end of
    file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For every test case, output the total time, in seconds,
    required to get <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> liters
    of water to the destination tub in the manner described above.
    Your answer should have an absolute error of no more than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span>.</p>
