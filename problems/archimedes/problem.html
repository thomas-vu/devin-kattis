        Archimedes’s Spiral, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b =
        \frac{1}{2}$</span>
</div>
</div>
<p>Archimedes is the name of a new 2D video game, which is very
    simple: the player hits start, at which point their avatar
    moves along an Archimedean spiral starting from the origin.
    When they hit a button, the avatar detaches from the spiral in
    the direction it is currently moving. The goal is to hit a
    target. The avatar’s path after it detaches must not intersect
    with any part of the spiral.</p>
<p>To help study this game, you’re asked to write a program
    that given the spiral’s angular velocity computes the point at
    which the player would need to press the button to release the
    avatar from the spiral in order to hit the target.</p>
<p>An Archimedean spiral is created when a point moves with
    constant velocity along a line that rotates with constant
    angular velocity around the origin. When expressed in polar
    coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(r, \phi )$</span>,
    an Archimedean spiral has a simple formulation: <span class="tex2jax_process">$r = b \ \phi $</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is the distance from the origin
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$\phi $</span> is the angle
    between the point, origin, and the unit vector <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 0)$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> is a constant that determines the
    distance between successive rings of the spiral.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_
    x$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ y$</span>,
    denoting the parameter <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0.01 \le b \le 10$</span>) of
    the spiral described by <span class="tex2jax_process">$r = b \
    \phi $</span> and the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x,
    y$</span> coordinates of the target <span class="tex2jax_process">$T = (t_ x, t_ y)$</span>, restricted by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10\, 000 \le t_ x, t_ y \le
    10\, 000$</span>. It is guaranteed that <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sqrt{t_ x^2+t_ y^2} &gt; 2 \pi b$</span>,
    i.e., the avatar will stay on the spiral for at least one full
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$360$</span> degree turn. It is
    also guaranteed that the distance from point <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> to the closest point on the spiral
    will be greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span>. There may be up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> significant digits in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, and up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> digits after the
    decimal point in <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ x$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ y$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x, y$</span>
    coordinates of the point on the spiral where the avatar should
    leave the spiral, continue in the direction it is moving, and
    hit the target without intersecting the spiral.</p>
<p>Your answer will be considered correct if the absolute or
    relative error of both <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> does not exceed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span>.</p>
