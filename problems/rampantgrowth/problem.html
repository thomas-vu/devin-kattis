<div class="problembody">
<p>Eddy is planning his garden, which can be represented as a
    grid. He wants his garden to have exactly one plant in each
    column. To make sure that plants do not compete for resources,
    if two plants are in adjacent columns, they must be in
    different rows.</p>
<p>Compute the number of different ways he can place plants in
    his garden to respect the above conditions. Two ways are
    different if one square has a plant in one arrangement but does
    not have a plant in the other. Because the number of ways may
    be large, output the number of ways modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$998\, 244\, 353$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The single line of input contains two space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq r,c\leq 50)$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is the number of rows
    in Eddyâ€™s garden grid, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is the number of columns.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the number of ways Eddy
    can place plants in his garden, modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$998\, 244\, 353$</span>.</p>
