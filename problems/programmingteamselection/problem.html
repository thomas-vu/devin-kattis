<p>You are a coach for a competitive learning program. It’s
    time for the regional competition and you have to group your
    students into teams. Every team needs exactly three members and
    every student needs to be on a team.</p>
<p>While choosing your teams, you must keep in mind whether
    particular students work well together. During the weeks and
    weeks of practice leading up to the competition, you have
    carefully observed your students working in pairs. You have
    made notes of which pairs work well together and which ones
    don’t. You are only willing to make a team of students
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> if <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> are known to work well together,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> are known to work well together,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> are known to work well
    together.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input contains up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> test cases. Each test case starts
    with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le m \le
    105$</span>, the number of pairs that work well together. This
    is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines,
    each containing space-separated names of two different students
    that work well together. A student name is a sequence of up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> upper- and lower-case
    letters (a–z). Each student has a unique name and every student
    name occurs in at least one pair. There are at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> students in a test
    case, and the sequence of test cases ends with value of zero
    for <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For every test case, output “possible” if it’s possible to
    group the students into teams the way you want to. If not,
    output “impossible”.</p>
