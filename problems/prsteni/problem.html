<p>After an exhausting morning, Mirko fell asleep. His brother
    Stanko, however, just awoke and, like his brother, is all about
    excitement. Stanko found N rings of varying radii in the
    garage. He arranged them on the floor so that each ring (except
    the first and last) touches the ones before and after it.</p>

<p>He started turning the first ring and noticed that the other
    rings turned as well; some faster, some slower!</p>
<p>Thrilled with his discovery, he decided to count how many
    times the other rings turn while the first ring turns once. He
    gave up after noticing that this number is not always an
    integer and not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>Write a program that determines how many times each ring
    turns while the first turns once.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N (3 \leq N\leq 100)$</span>, the number of
    rings.</p>
<p>The next line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1000$</span>, the radii of Stankoâ€™s rings,
    in the order they are laid out on the floor.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output must contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> lines. For every ring other than
    the first, in the order they are given in the input, output a
    fraction <span class="tex2jax_process">$A/B$</span>, meaning
    that the respective ring turns <span class="tex2jax_process">$A/B$</span> times while the first ring turns
    once. The fractions must be in reduced form (the numerator and
    denominator must not have a common divisor larger than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>).</p>
