<p>Alien invasion began, and scary man-eating aliens are
    establishing their bases all over the country. You are only
    safe on the places that are sufficiently far away from all
    current alien bases. You need to quickly write a program to
    help you determine where to move.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span> instances, each of them
    consisting of several lines. The first line of each instance
    contains integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10\ 000$</span>),
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq M \leq 100\ 000$</span>),
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq A \leq N$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq K \leq 100$</span>) separated by spaces, giving the number
    of towns in the country, the number of roads between them, the
    number of bases that the aliens are going to build, and the
    minimum safe distance from alien bases, respectively. The towns
    are assigned numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, \ldots ,
    N$</span>.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines
    describe the roads; each of them contains integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_1$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_2$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T_1 &lt; T_2 \leq N$</span>) and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq D \leq 100$</span>) separated by
    spaces, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span> is the
    length of the road between towns <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_2$</span>. There is at most one direct
    road between any two towns. All roads can be used in both
    directions.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> lines
    describe the positions of alien bases; the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th of them contains the number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq B_ i \leq N$</span>) of the town
    where the aliens build their <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th base.</p>
<p>The last instance is followed by a line containing four
    zeros.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output for each input instance consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> lines. On <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line, write the number of towns
    that are safe after the aliens build their <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th base. The town is safe if its
    distance from any of the towns <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_1, B_2, \ldots , B_ i$</span> is at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>.</p>
<p>Print one empty line after each instance.</p>
