<p>Professor Zac is trying to finish a collection of tasks
    during the first week at the start of the term. He knows
    precisely how long each task will take, down to the
    millisecond. Unfortunately, it is also Frosh Week. Zacâ€™s office
    window has a clear view of the stage where loud music is
    played. He cannot focus on any task when music is blaring.</p>
<p>The event organizers are also very precise. They supply Zac
    with intervals of time when music will not be playing. These
    intervals are specified by their start and end times down to
    the millisecond.</p>
<p>Each task that Zac completes must be completed in one quiet
    interval. He cannot pause working on a task when music plays
    (he loses his train of thought). Interstingly, the lengths of
    the tasks and quiet intervals are such that it is impossible to
    finish more than one task per quiet interval!</p>
<p>Given a list of times <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_
    i$</span> (in milliseconds) that each task will take and a list
    of times <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell _ j$</span> (in
    milliseconds) specifying the lengths of the intervals when no
    music is being played, what is the maximum number of tasks that
    Zac can complete?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a pair of integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of tasks and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number of time
    intervals when no music is played. The second line consists of
    a list of integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1, t_2,
    \ldots , t_ n$</span> indicating the length of time of each
    task. The final line consists of a list of times <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ell _1, \ell _2, \ldots , \ell _ m$</span>
    indicating the length of time of each quiet interval when Zac
    is at work this week.</p>
<p>You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq
    n,m \leq 200\, 000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000 \leq t_ i, \ell _ j \leq 199\,
    999$</span> for each task <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and each quiet interval
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output consists of a single line containing a single integer
    indicating the number of tasks that Zac can accomplish from his
    list during this first week.</p>
