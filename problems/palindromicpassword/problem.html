<div class="problembody">
<p>The IT department at your school decided to change their
    password policy. Each password will have to consist of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>-digit numbers separated by dashes,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> will be
    determined by the phase of the moon and the weather forecast
    for the day after it will be generated.</p>
<p>You realized that, if all of the numbers were palindromes
    (same numbers as the original ones if read backwards), you
    would have to remember a bunch of <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-digit numbers, which did not sound
    that bad (at the time).</p>
<p>In order to generate your password of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> numbers, you get a list of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> randomly generated
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>-digit numbers and find
    the palindromic number closest to them.</p>
<p>Of course, you would like to automate this process...</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains a single positive
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \leq 1000$</span>
    indicating the number of six-digit numbers in the input. Each
    of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contains a six-digit number without leading zeroes.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each six-digit number in the input, output another
    six-digit number that is closest to it and is also a
    palindrome. “Closest” in this context means “a number having
    the smallest absolute difference with the original number”. If
    there are two different numbers satisfying the above condition,
    output the smaller one of the two. Remember, no leading
    zeroes.</p>
