<p>You work for a day care center. You have a big tub of convex
    polygons that you are going to let the children play with.
    However, you notice that some of the shapes have pointy
    corners. You decide to make them safer by cutting off the most
    pointy corners as illustrated below. You choose the corner that
    has the most acute angle. You then cut straight across from its
    two neighboring corners. In the following figure, the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$cde$</span> angle is the
    sharpest. You cut it off by cutting straight from <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$e$</span>. You then throw away the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> corner you just cut
    off and keep the <span class="tex2jax_process">$abce$</span>
    shape.</p>

</center>
<p>You repeatedly cut off the sharpest corner until you are
    left with a triangle or until cutting off the most pointy
    corner produces an even more pointy corner. For example, after
    cutting off the <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> corner
    above, angle <span class="tex2jax_process">$cea$</span> is the
    sharpest. However, if you cut it off, you would just produce
    even sharper angles. Thus, you should stop after just one cut.
    For some shapes, you may not be able to cut off any corners
    because they either start as a triangle or are not improved by
    cutting off the sharpest corner. There will never be more than
    one sharpest corner that is also cuttable.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> shape descriptions. Each shape
    starts with a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le
    20$</span> giving the number of corners. This is followed by a
    sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> pairs of
    integers, each pair giving the <span class="tex2jax_process">$X
    \; Y$</span> location of a corner. All coordinates are in the
    range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0, 15\, 000]$</span>.
    Corners are given in clockwise order around the perimeter of
    each shape. Every shape has at least three corners and no two
    corners are coincident. The end of input is marked with a value
    of zero for <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each shape, print a line giving what the shape looks
    like after you are done cutting it. Use the same format as the
    input and print the corners in the same order they were given
    in the input.</p>
