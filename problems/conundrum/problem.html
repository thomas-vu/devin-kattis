<p>The walls of the corridors at the Theoretical Computer
    Science group (TCS) at KTH are all but covered with
    whiteboards. Some of the faculty members are cryptographers,
    and like to write cryptographic puzzles on the whiteboards. A
    new puzzle is added whenever someone discovers a solution to
    the previous one.</p>
<p>When Per walked in the corridor two weeks ago, he saw that
    the newest puzzle read “<tt class="ttfamily">GuvfVfNGrfg</tt>”.
    After arriving at his computer, he quickly figured out that
    this was a simple ROT13 encryption of “<tt class="ttfamily">ThisIsATest</tt>”.</p>
<p>The series of lousy puzzles continued next week, when a new
    puzzle read<br/>
    “<tt class="ttfamily">VmkgdGFyIHPDpGtlcmhldGVuIHDDpSBzdMO2cnN0YSBhbGx2YXIK</tt>”.
    This was just base64-encoded text! “Enough with these pranks”,
    Per thought; “I’m going to show you!”</p>
<p>Now Per has come up with a secret plan: every day he will
    erase one letter of the cipher text and replace it with a
    different letter, so that, in the end, the whole text reads
    “<tt class="ttfamily">PerPerPerPerPerPerPer</tt>”. Since Per
    will change one letter each day, he hopes that people will not
    notice.</p>
<p>Per would like to know how many days it will take to
    transform a given cipher text into a text only containing his
    name, assuming he substitutes one letter each day. You may
    assume that the length of the original cipher text is a
    multiple of <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>.</p>
<p>For simplicity, you can ignore the case of the letters, and
    instead assume that all letters are upper-case.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains the cipher text on
    the whiteboard. It consists of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$300$</span> upper-case characters, and its
    length is a multiple of <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of days needed to change the cipher text
    to a string containing only Per’s name.</p>
