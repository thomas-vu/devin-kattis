<p>John Nash is a talented mathematician at Princeton. Due to
    his prolific contributions in academia, he was even recruited
    to the Pentagon at a young age to crack enemy encrypted
    telecommunication. In his first task, John was able to decipher
    the code mentally, much to the astonishment of other
    decrypters. In his everyday life, he is constantly looking for
    patterns in magazines to newspapers to keep his senses
    sharp.<br/></p>
<p>Recently, he has been cracking away at a cryptography
    problem that involves prime numbers. Given a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, the puzzle needs him
    to produce a “beautiful" list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> primes. A list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> primes numbers is considered
    beautiful if each prime is at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span>, and their product has
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    digits.<br/></p>
<p>For example, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$N =
    1$</span>, then the list <span class="tex2jax_process">$[5]$</span> is beautiful because its length
    is <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>, and its product
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> has <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> digit.<br/></p>
<p>For <span class="tex2jax_process">$N = 2$</span>, the list
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[3, 7]$</span> is beautiful
    because its product <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \times 7 =
    21$</span> has the required digit count of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.<br/></p>
<p>For <span class="tex2jax_process">$N = 3$</span>, the list
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[5, 5, 7]$</span> is beautiful
    because its product <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 \times 5
    \times 7 = 175$</span> has the required digit count of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>.<br/></p>
<p>John wants to practice his mental math and impress his
    colleagues. He needs you to write a program that helps him
    practice this interesting task. John Nash has a beautiful mind,
    so won’t you help him find some beautiful primes?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 50$</span>), the number of
    test cases.<br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines follow, each of
    which is a test case consisting of a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 1\, 000$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print, on a separate line, a list of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space-delimited
    beautiful primes that are each no greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span>. The primes do not
    have to be distinct, and may be printed in any order. If there
    are multiple answers, you may print any of them.<br/></p>
