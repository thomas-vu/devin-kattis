</div>The cuckoo bird pops out of the cuckoo clock and sounds
    off once on the quarter hour, half hour, and three-quarter
    hour. At the beginning of each hour, it sounds off the hour
    (1–12). Given the current time and a target number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, your task is to determine what
    time it will be when the cuckoo bird finishes sounding off
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> times. If the cuckoo
    bird would be sounding off at the starting time, include those
    sounds in the count.
    <p>If the count is reached on the hour, report the time at the
    start of that hour. That is, you may assume the cuckoo finishes
    sounding off before the minute is up.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of 2 lines. The first line contains the
    current time in the form <tt>HH:MM</tt> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq \texttt{HH} \leq 12$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq \texttt{MM} \leq
    59$</span>, with leading 0’s if necessary. The second line
    contains a single integer representing the target number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 200$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the time at which the cuckoo bird has sounded off
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> times. The time should
    be printed in the same format as the input.</p>
