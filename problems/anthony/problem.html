<div class="problembody">
<p>Anthony and Cora play a very exciting game. Initially,
    Anthony has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> points and
    Cora has <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> points. The
    game then goes on for several rounds, during each round, either
    Anthony wins or Cora wins, the loser of the round loses
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> point while nothing
    happens to the winner of the round. The game ends when either
    Anthony or Cora has no points left, and the one still left with
    points is the winner of the game.</p>
<p>Cora promises Anthony a sweet prize if he wins the game, but
    will cruelly humiliate Anthony if he loses. Anthony can very
    accurately evaluate himself and perfectly predict that his
    probability of winning the round <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span>. Now, in order to decide
    whether to play this game with Cora or not, he needs to know
    the probability of him winning the game.</p>
<p>Help Anthony find his probability of winning!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contain integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq N,M\leq 1\, 000$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N+M-1$</span> lines follow, with the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq p_ i\leq 1$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> has at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> decimal digits.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing the probability of Anthony
    winning this game. Your answer will be considered correct if
    its absolute or relative error doesnâ€™t exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
