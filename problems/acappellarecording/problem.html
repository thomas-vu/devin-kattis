<p>Geoffry is preparing an a cappella composition where he
    sings the entire song by himself.</p>
<p>Each note of the song has a pitch between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9$</span>. Because of the varying pitches
    in the song, Geoffry will record himself singing multiple
    times. In a single recording, he will pick some subset of the
    notes to sing and he will sing exactly those notes. To avoid
    straining his voice too much, within a single recording, there
    is a limit to the difference between the maximum pitch and the
    minimum pitch among the notes he sings.</p>
<p>Compute the minimum number of times that Geoffry can record
    himself singing the song and each note is sung in at least one
    of the recordings.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 10^5, 0 \le d \le 10^9$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of notes in
    Geoffry’s song, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> is
    the largest difference between the minimum pitch and the
    maximum pitch that Geoffry can handle.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \le p \le 10^9$</span>). These are the pitches of the notes in
    Geoffry’s song, in the order that they are to be sung.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, which is the minimum number of
    times that Geoffry can record himself singing the song and each
    note is sung in at least one of the recordings.</p>
