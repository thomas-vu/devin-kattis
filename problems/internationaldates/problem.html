<div class="problembody">
<p>You read a lot of documents that come from the United
    States, Europe, and other countries around the world. The issue
    is that their date formats aren’t consistent! The US formats
    their dates as MM/DD/YYYY while in Europe they format it as
    DD/MM/YYYY. That is, in the US the month comes before the day,
    while in Europe the day comes first. Given a date, can you
    determine if its <i class="it">definitely</i> the US format,
    for sure European, or could be either? (Note that there are
    even more date formats, but luckily since the year is
    guaranteed to be last in this case, we only have to worry about
    these 2 formats.)</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single string comprised of 3
    integers separated by forward slashes, as <span class="tex2jax_process">$AA/BB/CCCC$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le AA, BB, \le 31$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le CCCC \le 9999$</span>. It
    is guaranteed that the given string will be a valid date for at
    least one of the formats. You can assume that all <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> months have exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$31$</span> days, so there is no need to
    worry about months with 30 days, or February.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output either <tt>US</tt> if the date doesn’t conform to the
    European format, or <tt>EU</tt> if the date doesn’t conform to
    the US format. Otherwise, output <tt>either</tt> if there is no
    way to know for sure which format the date follows.</p>
