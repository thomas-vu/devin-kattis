<div class="problembody">
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> people wish to
    cross a bridge at night. A group of at most two people may
    cross at any time, and each group must have a flashlight. Only
    one flashlight is available among the n people, so some sort of
    shuttle arrangement must be arranged in order to return the
    flashlight so that more people may cross.</p>
<p>Each person has a different crossing speed; the speed of a
    group is determined by the speed of the slower member. Your job
    is to determine a strategy that gets all n people across the
    bridge in the minimum time.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1000$</span>, followed by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each containing
    a positive integer, giving the crossing times for each of the
    people. Nobody takes more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> seconds to cross the bridge.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The first line of output must contain the total number of
    seconds required for all n people to cross the bridge. The
    following lines give a strategy for achieving this time. Each
    line contains either one or two integers, indicating which
    person or people form the next group to cross. Each person is
    indicated by the crossing time specified in the input. Although
    many people may have the same crossing time the ambiguity is of
    no consequence.</p>
<p>Note that the crossings alternate directions, as it is
    necessary to return the flashlight so that more may cross. If
    more than one strategy yields the minimal time, any one will
    do.</p>
