<p>Frank N. Stein is a very conservative high-school teacher.
    He wants to take some of his students on an excursion, but he
    is afraid that some of them might become couples. While you can
    never exclude this possibility, he has made some rules that he
    thinks indicates a low probability two persons will become a
    couple:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Their height differs by more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span> cm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are of the same sex.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their preferred music style is different.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Their favourite sport is the same (they are likely to be
        fans of different teams and that would result in
        fighting).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, for <em>any two</em> persons that he brings on the
    excursion, they must satisfy <em>at least one</em> of the
    requirements above. Help him find the maximum number of persons
    he can take, given their vital information.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 1000$</span> giving the number
    of pupils. Next there will be one line for each pupil
    consisting of four space-separated data items:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span>
        (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le h \le 3\,
        000$</span>) giving the height in cm;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a character ‘<tt class="ttfamily">F</tt>’ for female or
        ‘<tt class="ttfamily">M</tt>’ for male;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a string describing the preferred music style;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a string with the name of the favourite sport.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The strings in the input are of length at at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> characters, and
    contain only upper and lower case letters, digits, and
    dashes.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case in the input there should be one line
    with an integer giving the maximum number of eligible
    pupils.</p>
