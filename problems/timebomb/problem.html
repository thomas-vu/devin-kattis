<p>You and your teammates from the anti-bomb squad of the local
    police have been called to defuse a bomb found in the only pub
    in town. Fearing the tragic consequences this might produce,
    you go to the scene as quickly as possible. After some
    research, you learn that the bad guys have created a tricky way
    to allow them to defuse the bomb at will. You find a remote
    control with a button that you can take to a safe place. You
    also find that it is possible to connect to the bomb through a
    wireless connection and retrieve an ASCII representation of a
    code every 2 seconds. The bomb then gets defused if the button
    is pressed when the code is a number divisible by 6. But you
    have to be careful. If you press the button when the ASCII
    representation of the code is not a number divisible by 6 or
    has an invalid representation for any digit, the bomb will
    explode instead. You have to rely on your programming skills to
    write a program able to tell you if it is safe to press the
    button, before it blows out the pub (and the beer).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of an ASCII representation of a code.
    This code may have between 2 and 8 digits. Each digit is
    represented by 5 rows and 3 columns of characters, which can be
    either a space or a star character ’<tt class="ttfamily">*</tt>’. No other type of character (except for the
    new line character) will ever appear in the input. There is
    also one column of spaces (and only spaces) to separate each
    digit. After the last digit you will find a column of new line
    characters. Note that although every digit will always be of
    size <span class="tex2jax_process">$5\times 3$</span>, there is
    no guarantee it will represent a valid digit between 0 and 9
    inclusive. The valid <span class="tex2jax_process">$5\times
    3$</span> representations for each digit are given below in
    Figure 1.</p>

          characters on the top are there only to mark the 3

<p>The code can have leading zeros, hence an ASCII
    representation of, for example, 00000076 represents the number
    76. You may also safely assume that every valid code will
    correspond to a strictly positive number.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print one line with “<tt class="tt">BEER!!</tt>” if it is
    safe to press the button and defuse the bomb, and “<tt class="tt">BOOM!!</tt>” otherwise.</p>
