<div class="problembody">
<p>You are playing a game on a hexagonal board of size
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>. The middle row is
    composed of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> hexagons,
    and the top and bottom rows each have <span class="tex2jax_process">$(S + 1) / 2$</span> hexagons. (<span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> will be odd.) The hexagons are
    numbered starting with 1 in the upper left, and increasing
    left-to-right and top-to-bottom. Here is a hexagonal board of
    size <span class="tex2jax_process">$S=5$</span>:</p>

<img alt="\includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth ]{hexagon.png}" src="/problems/hexagon/file/statement/en/img-0001.png" style="width:30.00%"/>
</center>
<p>The game starts with <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> checkers on the board. Multiple
    checkers might start in the same position. Each checker also
    has an associated integer value between 0 and 50, inclusive. A
    turn consists of choosing a checker and moving it to an
    adjacent position, which increments your score by the value of
    that checker. Checkers cannot move off the board. Each position
    can contain any number of checkers at the same time.</p>
<p>The game ends when all the checkers are lined up in a
    straight row, with exactly one checker per hexagon. There are
    three possible ending configurations on any board. For
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S=5$</span>, the game will end
    when checkers are in positions <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 5, 10, 15, 19)$</span>, or in positions
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3, 6, 10, 14, 17)$</span>, or
    in positions <span class="tex2jax_process">$(8, 9, 10, 11,
    12)$</span>. Your program must output the smallest possible
    score of a finished game.</p>
<p>For example, assume the checkers start in positions
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1, 2, 5, 15, 19)$</span>. The
    checker in position 1 has a value of 1, the checkers in
    positions 2 and 5 have values of 3, and the checkers in
    positions 15 and 19 have values of 0. You could move the
    checker from position 1 into position 5 and then position 10.
    Both of these moves add one point to your score. Then you could
    move the checker from position 2 into position 1, adding three
    points to your score. This game would end with a score of 5,
    which is the lowest possible score for this starting
    configuration.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of input gives the number of cases,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> test cases follow. Each case
    consists of two lines. The first line contains the starting
    positions of the checkers, space separated. The second line
    contains the values of each checker, respectively, space
    separated.</p>
<p>It holds that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq
    10$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq S \leq
    75$</span>; <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is
    odd.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing “<tt class="ttfamily">Case #<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>:</tt>
    ” followed by the minimum possible score of a finished
    game.</p>
