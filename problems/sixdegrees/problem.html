<p>For years and years, the ICT Senior Service Desk (ISSD) of
    the university has been confronted with a slow wired network
    that gives unexpected time-outs and seemingly random slow
    connection speeds. A new manager has been hired to solve these
    problems once and for all. The manager does not have any
    computer science or IT knowledge, but he does happen to have a
    strong background in sociology. He quickly finds that the
    network problems only affect devices of old professors with an
    office in some distant corner of the building.</p>
<p>Obsessed by the idea of six degrees of separation, the new
    manager proposes a rule to counter the network problems. This
    rule says that any two devices in the network should be
    connected via at most 5 intermediary devices. So, given the
    current lay-out of the university’s wired computer network, he
    decides to prepare a list of all devices of peripheral
    professors that are currently not able to connect to all other
    devices within 6 steps. The manager’s solution to the network
    problems is then to disconnect all devices on this list from
    the wired network at once. He explicitly ignores the fact that,
    possibly, then disconnecting these devices in a particular
    order may lead to a network structure such that some devices on
    the list actually no longer have to be disconnected, or that
    afterwards additional devices may have to be disconnected or
    connected to reach the actual desired result.</p>
<p>The board of the university, not having a background in
    computer science, IT or sociology is also not bothered by
    whether or not the proposed solution is correct, but will
    instead only base its decision on whether or not the prepared
    list of devices to be disconnected is not too long, so that not
    too many professors would be affected. The board will therefore
    only approve the plan if no more than 5% of the wired network
    devices is on the list.</p>
<p>Given the lay-out of the network, in the form of a list of
    pairs of IP addresses or hostnames representing directly
    connected devices, determine whether or not the university
    board will allow the new manager to execute his plan.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 2$</span>), the number of test
    cases. Then for each test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq M \leq 30\, 000$</span> denoting
        the number of (directly) connected pairs of devices (with
        at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\, 000$</span>
        unique devices).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines, each
        line containing two IP addresses or hostnames of (directly)
        connected devices, represented by two strings of printable
        ASCII characters (of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$\leq 64$</span>) without whitespace.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each pair of connected devices is included once in the input
    file. All connections are bidirectional. You may assume that
    all devices in the university network are in the same connected
    component of devices.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing either
    <tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt> if the plan is allowed to be
    executed or <tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt> if the plan is not
    allowed to be executed.</p>
