<p>Gunnar and his friends like games which involve rolling
    dice. Gunnar has a huge collection of 6-sided, 12-sided and
    20-sided dice. All the games with dice started to bore him, so
    he came up with a new game. He rolls an <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>-sided die <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> times and wins if at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> different numbers
    appear in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> throws.
    An <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>-sided die contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> distinct numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, \dots , s$</span> on its
    sides.</p>
<p>Since this is a game only for one person, Gunnar and his
    friends decided to make it more fun by letting other people bet
    on a particular game. Before you bet on a particular game, you
    would like to know how probable it is to throw at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> different numbers in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> throws with an
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>-sided die. We assume
    that all numbers have the same probability of being thrown in
    each throw.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line with three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le n\le 10\, 000, 1 \le k \le s \le
    500$</span>). <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the
    number of throws, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> the
    number of different numbers that are needed to win and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is the number of sides
    the die has.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with the probability that a player throws at
    least <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> different
    numbers within <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> throws
    with an <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>-sided die.
    Your answer should be within absolute or relative error at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-7}$</span>.</p>
