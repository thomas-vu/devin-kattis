<p>Soccer coach Joe has invented a new fitness game that he
    thinks will help his players’ agility and fitness. The center
    circle of the soccer pitch has a diameter of <span class="tex2jax_process">$60$</span> feet. He marks <span class="tex2jax_process">$28$</span> evenly-spaced points on the
    circumference of the circle. On the first point (arbitrarily
    chosen) he places a pile of tokens all inscribed with the
    letter ’A’. On the second point he places a pile of ’B’ tokens,
    and so on, covering <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span>
    of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$28$</span> points. He
    places a pile of blanks (or space-characters) on the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$27^{\rm th}$</span> point and a
    pile of disks imprinted with single quotation marks, on the
    last point.</p>
<p>He gives each player a slip of paper containing an aphorism,
    such as “WINNING ISN’T EVERYTHING IT’S THE ONLY THING” Notice
    that the only punctuation marks allowed are spaces and single
    quotation marks. Each player gets a different aphorism.</p>
<p>A player starts outside the circle next to the first letter
    of his aphorism and, on Joe’s “GO” signal, the player picks up
    his first disk and then takes off running around the outside of
    the circle, picking up the remaining disks in the order that
    the corresponding letters appear in the aphorism. A smart
    player will take the shortest route, possibly changing
    direction, between consecutive letters of his aphorism.</p>
<p>One of the assistant coaches makes a note of the player’s
    time. Although Joe initially envisioned all of his <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> players running around the circle
    simultaneously, this idea was scrapped due to contusions and
    fractures.</p>
<p>Joe wants you to write a program to estimate the expected
    time for <b class="bf">one</b> smart player to complete each of
    the aphorisms. Assume for simplicity that the player runs at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> feet per second
    between stops for pickups and that each pickup takes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> second.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq N \leq 20)$</span> giving the number of aphorisms to
    follow. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines follow,
    each one containing an aphorism made up of upper-case letters,
    single quotation marks, and spaces. Each aphorism will be
    between <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$120$</span> characters
    inclusive.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each aphorism give the time for a smart player to
    complete the task. Your answer should be accurate to within
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> seconds.</p>
