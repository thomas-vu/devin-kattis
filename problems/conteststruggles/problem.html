</div>Lotte is competing in a programming contest. Her team has
    already solved <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> out of
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> problems in the
    problem set, but as the problems become harder, she begins to
    lose focus and her mind starts to wander.
    <p>She recalls hearing the judges talk about the difficulty of
    the problems, which they rate on an integer scale from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>, inclusive. In fact, one of the
    judges said that “<i class="itshape">the problem set has never
    been so tough, the average difficulty of the problems in the
    problem set is <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>!</i>”</p>
<p>She starts thinking about the problems her team has solved
    so far, and comes up with an estimate <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> for their average difficulty. In
    hope of gaining some motivation, Lotte wonders if she can use
    this information to determine the average difficulty of the
    remaining problems.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq n\leq 10^6$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; k &lt; n$</span>), the total
        number of problems and the number of problems Lotte’s team
        has solved so far.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq d,s \leq 100$</span>), the average
        difficulty of all the problems and Lotte’s estimate of the
        average difficulty of the problems her team has solved.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Assuming Lotte’s estimate is correct, output the average
    difficulty of the unsolved problems, or “<tt class="ttfamily">impossible</tt>” if the average difficulty does not
    exist. Your answer should have an absolute or relative error of
    at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
