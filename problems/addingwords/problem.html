<p>Psychologists at Wassamatta University believe that humans
    are able to more easily deal with words than with numbers. So
    they have devised experiments to find out if this is true. In
    an interesting twist, one of their experiments deals with using
    words which represent numbers. Rather than adding numbers, they
    want to add words. You are a research programmer on the
    project, and your job is to write a program that demonstrates
    this ability.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input is a sequence of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$2000$</span> commands, one per line, ending
    at end of file. Each command is a definition, a calculation, or
    a clear. All tokens within a command are separated by single
    spaces.</p>
<p>A definition has the format <tt class="tt">def x y</tt>
    where <tt class="tt">x</tt> is a variable name and <tt class="tt">y</tt> is a an integer in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-1\, 000, 1\, 000]$</span>. No two
    variables are ever defined to have the same numeric value at
    the same time. If <tt class="tt">x</tt> had been defined
    previously, defining it again erases its old definition.
    Variable names are up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> lowercase characters, each
    character from the range a to z.</p>
<p>A calculation command starts with the word <tt class="tt">calc</tt>, and is followed by one to <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span> more variable names separated by
    addition or subtraction operators. The end of a <tt class="tt">calc</tt> command is an equals sign. For example:</p>
<center>
<tt class="tt">calc foo + bar - car =</tt>
</center>
<p>The <tt class="tt">clear</tt> command instructs your program
    to forget all of its definitions.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Your program should produce no output for definitions, but
    for calculations it should produce the value of the
    calculation. If there is not a word for the result, or some
    word in the calculation has not been defined, then the result
    of the calculation should be <tt class="tt">unknown</tt>. The
    word <tt class="tt">unknown</tt> is never used as a variable in
    the input.</p>
