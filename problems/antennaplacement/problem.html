<p>The Global Aerial Research Centre has been allotted the task
    of building the fifth generation of mobile phone nets in
    Sweden. The most striking reason why they got the job, is their
    discovery of a new, highly noise resistant, antenna. It is
    called 4DAir, and comes in four types. Each type can only
    transmit and receive signals in a direction aligned with a
    (slightly skewed) latitudinal and longitudinal grid, because of
    the interacting electromagnetic field of the earth. The four
    types correspond to antennas operating in the directions north,
    west, south, and east, respectively. Below is an example
    picture of places of interest, depicted by twelve small rings,
    and nine 4DAir antennas depicted by ellipses covering them.</p>

<p>Obviously, it is desirable to use as few antennas as
    possible, but still provide coverage for each place of
    interest. We model the problem as follows: Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> be a rectangular matrix describing
    the surface of Sweden, where an entry of <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> either is a point of interest,
    which must be covered by at least one antenna, or empty space.
    Antennas can only be positioned at an entry in <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>. When an antenna is placed at row
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and column
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, this entry is
    considered covered, but also one of the neighbouring entries
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(c+1,r)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(c,r+1)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(c-1,r)$</span>, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$(c,r-1)$</span>, is covered depending on the
    type chosen for this particular antenna. What is the least
    number of antennas for which there exists a placement in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> such that all points
    of interest are covered?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first row of input is a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 20$</span>,
    specifying the number of scenarios that follow. Each scenario
    begins with a row containing two positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le h \le 50$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le w \le 10$</span>. Thereafter is a
    matrix presented, describing the points of interest in Sweden
    in the form of <span class="tex2jax_process">$h$</span> lines,
    each containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>
    characters from the set <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{
    \texttt{*}, \texttt{o}\} $</span>. A ‘<tt class="ttfamily">*</tt>’-character symbolises a point of interest,
    whereas a ‘<tt class="ttfamily">o</tt>’-character represents
    open space.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each scenario, output the minimum number of antennas
    necessary to cover all ‘<tt class="ttfamily">*</tt>’-entries in
    the scenario’s matrix, on a row of its own.</p>
