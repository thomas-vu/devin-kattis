<div class="problembody">
<p>You are making a recipe and need to measure a precise volume
    of liquid. There are an assortment of cups of varying volumes
    in your kitchen, however no cup has any markings on it other
    than to indicate its total volume, and none of them match the
    volume that you want. You start with the biggest cup full of
    liquid and, to make sure you know precisely how much volume you
    are working with at any point in time, you consider steps in
    which you pour from any nonempty cup into another cup, always
    pouring until either the cup you are pouring into becomes full,
    or the cup you are pouring from becomes empty (whichever occurs
    first). As a simple example, assume you start with a full cup
    having capacity <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>,
    and you have another cup with capacity <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, but your goal is to have
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> units of the
    liquid in the largest cup. In this case, you can start pouring
    from the larger cup to the smaller, stopping when the smaller
    one reaches its capacity of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>. This will leave precisely
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> units in the
    larger cup. See Figure 1(a).</p>

</div>
<p>As another example, consider a case in which you have
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> cups with capacities
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, and you start with the largest
    cup full, the rest empty, and a goal of ending with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> units in the
    largest cup. For ease of discussion we will refer to the cup
    with capacity <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span> as
    the “<span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>-cup” and
    similarly for the other sizes. You notice that the <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>-cup and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>-cup have combined capacity of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>, and so you could pour
    from the original <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>-cup
    to fill those two cups, then dump the remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> unit from the <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>-cup into the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-cup, and finally pour the full
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>-cup and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>-cup back into the <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>-cup. See Figure 1(b). In
    implementing this strategy, the total volume of liquid poured
    would be <span class="tex2jax_process">$6+2+1+6+2=17$</span>.
    You could achieve this goal in another way: pour <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> units from the <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>-cup to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-cup (leaving <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> units in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>-cup), then fill the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>-cup from the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>-cup (leaving <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> unit in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> cup), and finally pour the
    full <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>-cup back into the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>-cup, resulting in
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> units in
    that cup. With this strategy, the total volume poured is only
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3+2+2=7$</span>. See
    Figure 1(c).</p>
<p>As a final example, you start with cups of capacities
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, with the <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>-cup full, and a goal of ending up
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> units in
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>-cup. Obviously,
    you could fill the <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>-cup, dump the remaining
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> unit into another
    cup, and then pour from the full <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>-cup back into the <span class="tex2jax_process">$11$</span>-cup, as illustrated in
    Figure 2(a). These three pours would mean transferring a
    total volume of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10+1+10=21$</span>. Figure 2(b) shows a
    sequence with more steps, but less liquid poured.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line of positive integers:
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_2$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_ n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span>, where there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> cups, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq 5$</span>, having capacities
    satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$ 64 \geq
    c_1&gt;c_2&gt; \ldots &gt; c_ n \geq 1$</span>. The value
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$V &lt; c_1$</span> designates
    the desired volume. You must start with largest cup (that with
    capacity <span class="tex2jax_process">$c_1$</span>) full
    of liquid and the other cups empty, and the goal is to get
    exactly volume <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span>
    into the <em>largest</em> cup.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the minimum amount of liquid that must be poured to
    achieve the goal, or output <tt class="tt">impossible</tt> if
    the goal cannot be achieved.</p>
