<div class="problembody">
<p>A company (name withheld) has an office building in the
    center of Lund. The building has a perfectly square roof with a
    number of hatches. Because of a series of burglaries where the
    perpetrators have entered through these hatches, it was decided
    to use a watchdog to guard the hatches. A particularly vicious
    but rather stupid breed of dog was chosen, and unfortunately
    the dog fell off the roof on its third watch.</p>
<p>A new dog has been procured and it has been decided to
    attach a leash to its collar and attach the other end at some
    point on the roof. However, if the leash is too short the dog
    cannot reach all hatches, but if it is too long then the dog
    will fall off the building again. The leash has hooks at both
    ends, so no part of it is used to tie knots. The company wants
    the dog to reach the center of each hatch (the dog can reach
    exactly as far as the leash could reach if it were lying flat
    on the roof), but it does not want the leash to extend beyond
    the edge of the roof (to the edge is OK). They hope that by
    carefully choosing the length of the leash and where to attach
    it, the dog will be able to reach all hatches without risking
    falling off the building. A leash can only be attached at a
    point with integer coordinates (if the building is <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> meters, then the south-west
    corner of the building has coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span> and the north-east corner has
    coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(10,10)$</span>). A
    leash cannot be attached at a point where there is a hatch.</p>
<p>If there is no place where you can attach a leash, reach all
    hatches but not reach beyond the edge of the roof, it is
    impossible to use this breed of dog, and the company will
    instead use a poodle (which is a less vicious type of dog, but
    also less prone to falling off buildings).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line of the input is a single positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N \le 100$</span>, telling the
    number of test cases to follow. Each case starts with one line
    with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is even, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le S \le 40$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le H \le 50$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> is the side of the square roof in
    meters and <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> is the
    number of hatches. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$H$</span> lines each contain two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>. These are the coordinates of the
    hatches. Hatches will never lie outside the roof or on the
    roof’s perimeter. No two hatches will occupy the same
    position.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing the
    coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> at which to fasten the
    leash (if there are several possible points, output the one
    with smallest <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, and if
    there are still several possibilities select the one with
    smallest <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> among those
    with smallest <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>) such
    that a leash of suitable length allows access to all hatches
    without extending beyond the edge of the roof. If there is no
    such point, output “poodle” for that test case.</p>
