<div class="problembody">
<p>Fred works as an IT consultant in an insurance company. As
    they always had a large amount of customers waiting and arguing
    at the front desk, management decided to deploy a ticket
    machine. Each customer would get a ticket with a number and
    there will be fancy LCD display over each desk showing the
    number of the next person. Fred was appointed to get this new
    enhancement working.</p>
<p>Because Fred is lazy when it comes to manual labor and as an
    IT consultant he wouldn’t lower himself to the level of some
    hardware technician (except when upgrading his own computer),
    he asked few technicians to install the displays and prepared
    himself just to plug in the ticket machine and try it out.
    Unfortunately (for Fred) the technicians, either inspired by
    Mr.Bean or because of their carelessness, installed the display
    upside-down.</p>
<p>Being a software guy, Fred decided that the hardware should
    not be tampered with after it is installed (except for the case
    if he would be able to get back the technicians to repair it,
    but they were already angry at him for his nagging). Then he
    noted that from time to time the display shows a correct number
    even when it is upside-down. And hey, the ticket machine is an
    embedded device and contains a small processor! It would be
    just a sin for an IT guy not to try to meddle with it and try
    running an own version of Linux. Now we just need to figure out
    which readable numbers will the display show.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>In the beginning the display shows the number 1 on its
    display. Each second the number shown is increased by 1. We see
    the display upside-down and thus not everything we see will
    make sense. Your task is to compute the <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>-th valid number we will see on the
    display. The digits the display uses are shown on the images
    below. An upside-down 1 still count as 1. The number we see may
    have leading zeroes – e.g. turning the number 600 upside
    down leads to a valid number.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input file will consist of several integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$K_ i$</span>, one per line. There will be at
    most 1100 lines in the input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each <span class="tex2jax_process">$K_ i$</span> from
    the input file, output the <span class="tex2jax_process">$K_
    i$</span>-th number shown on the display (including the leading
    zeroes, if there are some).</p>
