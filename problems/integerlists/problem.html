<p>The programming language <em>Better And Portable Code</em>
    (BAPC) is a language for working with lists of integers. The
    language has two built-in functions: ‘<tt>R</tt>’
    (<em>reverse</em>) and ‘<tt>D</tt>’ (<em>drop</em>).</p>
<p>The function ‘<tt>R</tt>’ reverses its input list, and
    ’<tt>D</tt>’ drops the first element of its input and returns
    the rest, or gives an error in case its input is an empty list.
    To get more advanced behavior, functions can be composed:
    “<tt>AB</tt>" is the function that first applies ‘<tt>A</tt>’
    to its input and then ‘<tt>B</tt>’ to the resulting list. For
    example, “<tt>RDD</tt>" is a function that reverses a list and
    then drops the first two elements.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, our BAPC interpreter has bit rotted, so we
    ask you to write a new one. Given a BAPC program and its input,
    return its output or “<tt>error</tt>" in case ‘<tt>D</tt>’ is
    applied to an empty list. Lists are represented as the
    character ‘<tt>[</tt>’ followed by a comma-separated list of
    integers followed by the character ‘<tt>]</tt>’. Notice that
    the input and output lists can be quite long.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a string <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\le \text {length}(p) \le 100\,
        000)$</span>: a BAPC program, consisting of the characters
        ‘<tt>R</tt>’ and ‘<tt>D</tt>’.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0\le n \le 100\, 000)$</span>: the
        number of elements in the input.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>one line with a list of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers in the form
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$[x_1, \ldots ,x_ n]$</span>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\le x_ i \le 100)$</span>:
        the input list.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with the resulting integer list or
        “<tt>error</tt>" in case of an error.</p>
</li>
</ul>
