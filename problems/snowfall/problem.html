<p>The Yraglac cross-country skiing team would like to know if
    there will be enough snow on the ground to train after a
    certain number of days. They have a weather forecast in an
    unconventional format, described in the input section, and
    would like you to help them figure out how much snow there will
    be on the ground after all of the days in the forecast have
    passed.</p>
<p>Assume the ground starts out bare (with no snow).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n \leq 100$</span>), the number of days in the weather
    forecast.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines contains two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$t \in \{ 0, 1\} $</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1
    \leq a \leq 50)$</span>, with the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text {th}$</span> line containing weather
    information about the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\text
    {th}$</span> day.</p>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$t = 0$</span>, then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> millimeters of snow
    will fall on that day.</p>
<p>If <span class="tex2jax_process">$t=1$</span>, then up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> millimeters of snow
    will melt.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single integer, the depth of the snow after all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> days have passed, in
    millimeters.</p>
