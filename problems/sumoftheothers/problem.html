<div class="problembody">
<p>Every day, your job requires you to add up long lists of
    integers, like the following:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{eqnarray*} 3 + 2 + -4 + 8 + 3 + -6 + 1
    + 4 + 6 + -1 + -6 = 10 \end{eqnarray*}</span>
<p>That is, a sum of positive and negative integers, followed
    by an equals sign, followed by a single integer. To save
    yourself some time, you normally leave out the <span class="tex2jax_process">$+$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$=$</span> signs as you write down your work,
    so the previous example would be:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{eqnarray*} 3 \; \; 2 \; \; {-4} \; \;
    8 \; \; 3 \; \; {-6} \; \; 1 \; \; 4 \; \; 6 \; \; {-1} \; \;
    {-6} \; \; 10 \end{eqnarray*}</span>
<p>After you work out these sums, your coworker Bob types them
    into the office computer system. Unfortunately, Bob has been
    sloppy and has rearranged many of the numbers in your work. He
    has not changed any of the values in your list, heâ€™s just
    rearranged their order. Thus, your careful work might have been
    entered like:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{eqnarray*} 6 \; \; {-4} \; \; 3 \; \;
    10 \; \; 1 \; \; 4 \; \; {-1} \; \; {-6} \; \; 8 \; \; 3 \; \;
    2 \; \; {-6} \end{eqnarray*}</span>
<p>After sharing your unhappiness with Bob, you realize that
    this is not that great a problem. You can write a program to
    determine which of the values is the sum (the integer on the
    right of the equals sign).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> test cases, one per line. Each
    line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> integers in the range
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-500,500]$</span>. Input ends
    at end of file.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print the member of the list that is the
    sum of all the other integers in the list. Every test case will
    contain such a value.</p>
