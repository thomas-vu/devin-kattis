<div class="problembody">
<p>One day Mirko was cleaning up his room and found a ruler and
    a compass. He went to the school the next day and challenged
    his friend Slavko to a geometric construction battle. Mirko
    knows how to construct some angles using the ruler and compass
    and knows how to subtract and add any two angles he constructs.
    Slavko now shouts random angles and Mirko must draw them as
    fast as possible.</p>
<p>You are observing this battle and would like to know if
    Mirko can construct the angles Slavko shouts at all.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 10$</span>), number of angles Mirko knows how to
    construct initially and <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq K \leq 10$</span>), the number of angles Slavko
    selected.</p>
<p>The second line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> positive integers, all smaller
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$360$</span>, the angles
    Mirko knows how to construct initially.</p>
<p>The third line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> positive integers, all smaller
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$360$</span>, the angles
    Slavko selected.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>
    lines, one for each angle Slavko selected. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line should contain “<tt class="ttfamily">YES</tt>” if Mirko can construct the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th angle, and “<tt class="ttfamily">NO</tt>” otherwise.</p>
