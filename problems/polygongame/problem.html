<p>Jack and Jill are playing a game they call Polygon Game. In
    this game they start with a convex polygon and then take turns
    dividing the polygon into smaller parts. They divide the
    polygon by drawing a straight line from one point on the border
    of the original polygon to another point on the border of the
    original polygon. The goal of the game is then to guess which
    of the resulting polygons has the largest area.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>: The number of vertices in the
    original polygon, and the number of lines drawn by Jack and
    Jill.<br/>
    Then follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines,
    each consisting of two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y_ i$</span>, representing the coordinates
    of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^\textrm {th}$</span> of
    the vertex in original polygon given in a counter-clockwise
    order.<br/>
    Then follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> lines,
    each consisting four real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_1, Y_1, X_2,$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y_2$</span>, representing the two endpoints
    of a line drawn by Jack and Jill.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output should be a single line consisting of the area of
    the largest polygon created. Your answer must have an absolute
    or relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq N \leq
        25$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq M \leq
        50$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> will be an even
        number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq X_ i, Y_ i \leq
        1\, 000$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The polygonâ€™s vertices are distinct.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>All lines will start and end on the border of the
        original polygon with an absolute error of at most
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>, and all
        lines will divide the original polygon into two parts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Real numbers in the input will have at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> digits after the decimal
        point.</p>
</li>
