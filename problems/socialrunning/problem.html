<div class="problembody">
<p>You and a few friends are running together once a week
    around Lund. You all agree that it is boring and also dangerous
    to run on your own rather than running with others. Therefore
    you and your friends decide to minimize the distance that
    anyone needs to run on their own.</p>
<p>You are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> friends,
    who live in <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> different
    locations numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    through <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span>. Everyone
    will run exactly one lap going through all the locations in
    cyclic order (if you live in location <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, you run <span class="tex2jax_process">$i\rightarrow i+1\pmod{N}\rightarrow \ldots
    \rightarrow N-1\rightarrow 0\rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow
    i-1\pmod{N}\rightarrow i$</span>. Someone starts the run, then
    everyone joins the run as the group comes, runs exactly one lap
    and stops when the group comes back to their house.</p>

<p>Given that an optimal person starts the run, what is the
    minimal total distance that anyone has to run on their own? In
    the above example, an optimal choice would be to start the run
    at locationÂ <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>. Then
    the first runner has to run the leg from 3 to 0 alone, and it
    is easily checked that your friend living in location 2 also
    will be running alone from 1 to 2, for a total solitary
    distance of <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input contains the number of friends
    in the group, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2\leq N\leq 10$</span>). It is
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line
    contains a single integer, the distance from location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> to location
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+1\pmod{N}$</span>. Each
    distance is between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^4$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The output consists of a single integer, the minimal total
    distance anyone has to run on their own, given that the optimal
    person starts the run.</p>
