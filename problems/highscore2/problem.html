</div>MÃ¥rten and Simon enjoy playing the popular board game
    Seven Wonders, and have just finished a match. It is now time
    to tally the scores.

    <p>One of the ways to score in Seven Wonders is through the use
    of <em>Science</em>. During the game, the players may collect a
    number of Science tokens of three different types:
    <em>Cog</em>, <em>Tablet</em>, and <em>Compass</em>. If a
    player has <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> Cogs,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> Tablets and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> Compasses, that player
    gets <span class="tex2jax_process">$a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 7 \cdot
    \min (a, b, c)$</span> points.</p>
<p>However, the scoring is complicated by the concept of
    <em>Wildcard Science</em> tokens. For each Wildcard Science
    token a player has, she may count that as one of the three
    ordinary types of Science tokens. For instance, the first
    player in Sample Input 1 has <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> Cogs, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> Tablet, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> Compasses, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> Wildcard Science, so could thus
    choose to have the distributions <span class="tex2jax_process">$(3, 1, 2), (2, 2, 2)$</span> or <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2, 1, 3)$</span> of Cogs, Tablets and
    Compasses, respectively. The possible scores for this player
    are then <span class="tex2jax_process">$3^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 7
    \cdot 1 = 21$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^2 + 2^2
    + 2^2 + 7 \cdot 2 = 26$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^2 + 1^2 + 3^2 + 7 \cdot 1 = 21$</span>
    depending on how the Wildcard Science is assigned. Thus, the
    maximum score for this player is <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span>.</p>
<p>Given the number of tokens each player in the game has,
    compute the maximum possible score that each of them can
    achieve if they assign their Wildcard Science tokens
    optimally.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \le n \le 7$</span>), the number of
        players in the game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, each
        with four integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le a, b, c, d \le 10^9$</span>),
        giving the number of Cog, Tablet, Compass, and Wildcard
        Science tokens of a player.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each player, in the same order they are given in the
    input, output the maximum score the player may get.</p>
