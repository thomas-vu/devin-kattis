<p>General Torstein has sent the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-coordinate for the next joint
    attack and is expecting you to promptly follow his orders in
    order to avoid impeding doom. Unfortunately Torstein hates
    numbers with more than 2 digits and loves horizontal line
    segments, and has therefore sent the coordinate as a continued
    fraction, i.e.</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ x = x_0 + {1
    \over {x_1 + {1 \over {\ldots }}}} \]</span>
<p>Your rocket launcher only accepts coordinates as reduced
    fractions, so you need to quickly compute the correct numbers
    to feed it in order to commence the attack. Hurry! Failure may
    have dire consequences!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of output is one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq n &lt; 40$</span>), the number of coefficients in the
    continued fraction, followed by a line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq x_ i &lt; 100$</span>) the
    coefficients of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The coordinate <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> as a
    reduced fraction. It is guaranteed that the numerator and
    denominator are both less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{18}$</span>.</p>
