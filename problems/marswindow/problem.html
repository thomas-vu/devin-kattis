</div>You are an eccentric billionaire with an affinity for
    sending stuff to Mars. In an ideal world you would send stuff
    to Mars all the time, but your engineers tell you that it is
    most efficient to do it when Earth and Mars are somewhat close
    to each other.
    <p>Your engineers have calculated that optimal launch windows
    occur once every 26 months, and that one of them occurs in
    April 2018. They also tell you that they will not have any Big
    Finished Rockets by then, so you will have to wait for a later
    launch window.</p>
<p>Since your rocket scientists apparently can not be bothered
    to tell you about the optimal launch windows before it is too
    late, you have to keep track of that yourself. Write a program
    that determines if there is an optimal launch window in any
    given year.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The only line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2018 \le y \le 10000$</span>), the year you
    are interested in.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “<tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt>” if there is an
    optimal launch window in the year <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>, otherwise output “<tt class="ttfamily">no</tt>”.</p>
