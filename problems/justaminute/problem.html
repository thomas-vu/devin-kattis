</div>The city’s local subway service S.L., Super Lag, are
    currently being blamed that their displays, showing the
    expected wait time until the next train arrives, are faulty.
    Too many commuters have the experience of coming to the subway
    station, and then having to wait many more minutes than the
    display showed when they got there.

    <p>The American Commuter Movement and the International
    Commuting Peoples’ Community have had it with this. Especially
    Johan, a young student, who has decided to investigate this
    matter further. Johan went to one of the stations, and studied
    the behaviour of the displays. Each time the display showed a
    new number, Johan carefully measured the number of seconds that
    passed from that moment until the train arrived. As soon as
    that train left again, he did the same thing for the next train
    and so on. He remembered all the displayed minutes, and the
    wait time for each such in seconds. Although Johan has a very
    good memory, he does not know what to do with his measurements.
    He needs your help!</p>
<p>Your task is to help Johan calculate the average length of
    an S.L. minute (the length of a minute according to the
    display). You may assume that when the display shows a new
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, the expected
    S.L. wait time in that moment is exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> minutes.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 1\, 000$</span> – the number of
    observations Johan did. The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contain two positive
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$M \le 60$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S \le 3\, 600$</span> – the
    number of minutes displayed, and the number of seconds Johan
    had to wait for his train.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output should consist of a single real number: the average
    length of an S.L. minute, measured in real minutes. A relative
    or absolute error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-7}$</span> will be considered correct.
    If the average length of an S.L. minute is shorter than or
    equal to a normal minute, print the message "<tt class="tt">measurement error</tt>" instead.</p>
