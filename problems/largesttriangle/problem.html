<div class="problembody">
<p>Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> points on a
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>-dimensional space,
    determine the area of the largest triangle that can be formed
    using <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> of those
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> points. If there is no
    triangle that can be formed, the answer is <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \le N \le 5\, 000$</span>) denoting the number of points. Each
    of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x, y \leq 4 \cdot 10^7$</span>).
    There are <b class="bfseries">no</b> specific constraints on
    these <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> points, i.e. the
    points are not necessarily distinct, the points are not given
    in specific order, there may be <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> or more collinear points, etc.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the answer in one line. Your answer should have an
    absolute error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-5}$</span>.</p>
