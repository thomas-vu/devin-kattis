<div class="problembody">
<p>Due to the frantical usage of the racket to kill flies,
    Marin has sustained a serious bodily injury known to the
    medical community as epicondylitis lateralis humeri. His
    grandma has advised smearing rakija over it, the doctor has
    prescribed a strong painkiller, but Marin has ignored every
    single advice and decided to look for the answer in integer
    sequences.</p>
<p>He has discovered a previously undiscovered sequence of
    integers and called it the xorbonacci sequence. The
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-th element in the
    sequence is denoted with <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_
    n$</span>. The sequence is defined recursively in the following
    way:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{align*} x_1 &amp;
    = a_1,\\ x_2 &amp; = a_2,\\ &amp; \ldots \\ x_ k &amp; = a_
    k,\\ x_ n &amp; = x_{n-1} \oplus x_{n-2} \oplus \ldots \oplus
    x_{n-k}, \quad n &gt; k\\ \end{align*}</span>
<p>Because of a reason only known to Marin, he determined that
    all his sorrows will go away if you answer his <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> queries defined with numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>. The answer to the query is
    represented with the value</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{equation*} x_ l \oplus x_{l+1} \oplus
    \ldots \oplus x_{r-1} \oplus x_ r \end{equation*}</span>
<p>Help Marin and answer his queries.</p>
<p>Please note: The operation <span class="tex2jax_process">$\oplus $</span> is the operation of binary
    XOR.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq K \leq 100\, 000$</span>) from the task. The following
    line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> integers
    that represent the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> elements in the xorbonacci
    sequence. All numbers are smaller than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{18}$</span>. The following line contains
    the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq Q \leq 10^6$</span>)
    from the task. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th
    of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines
    contains two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$l_
    i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq l_ i \leq r_ i \leq
    10^{18}$</span>) that represent Marin’s <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th query.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> lines of output must contain the
    answers to Marin’s queries, the order being the same as the
    input.</p>
