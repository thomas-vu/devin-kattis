<div class="problembody">
<p>A large shipment of doodads has just arrived, and each
    doodad has a suggested retail price of <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> cents. You’ve noticed that
    consumers are much more likely to purchase goods when most of
    the trailing digits are the same. For example, items are more
    likely to be priced at <span class="tex2jax_process">$99$</span> cents rather than <span class="tex2jax_process">$57$</span> cents. So to make your goods more
    appealing, you’ve decided to sell your goods in bundles. To
    make a bundle, you choose a positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, and sell <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> doodads for <span class="tex2jax_process">$k \times b$</span> cents. With an
    appropriate choice of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    you can have a more pleasing price. For example, selling
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$57$</span>-cent doodads in
    bundles of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> means
    that each bundle sells for <span class="tex2jax_process">$399$</span> cents, which has two trailing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>s, rather than no
    trailing <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>s of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$57$</span>. This idea of
    trailing <span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>s can be
    generalized to any other trailing digit: bundles of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$692$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$57$</span>-cent doodads sell for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$39\, 444$</span> cents (three
    trailing <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>s) and bundles
    of one million doodads sell for <span class="tex2jax_process">$57\, 000\, 000$</span> cents (six trailing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>s).</p>
<p>After a little thought, you realize that you do not want to
    make your bundles too large—not only can the price be
    excessive, but who really needs several million doodads? For
    any type of doodad, your marketing department has a maximum
    bundle price of <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>.</p>
<p>Given the price of a doodad, the desired trailing digit, and
    the maximum price of a bundle, write a program that optimizes
    the trailing digits.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a single line containing three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq b &lt; 10^{6}$</span>) is the price of a doodad in cents,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq d \leq 9$</span>) is the desired
    trailing digit, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$b \leq a &lt; 10^{10\,
    000}$</span>) is the maximum price of a bundle.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum number of consecutive occurrences of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> that can appear at the
    end of a bundle price, given that the price of the bundle
    cannot exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>.</p>
