</div>The ministers of the cabinet were quite upset by the
    message from the Chief of Security stating that they would all
    have to change the four-digit room numbers on their
    offices.<br/>
    — It is a matter of security to change such things every now
    and then, to keep the enemy in the dark.<br/>
    — But look, I have chosen my number 1033 for good reasons. I am
    the Prime minister, you know!<br/>
    — I know, so therefore your new number 8179 is also a prime.
    You will just have to paste four new digits over the four old
    ones on your office door.<br/>
    — No, it’s not that simple. Suppose that I change the first
    digit to an 8, then the number will read 8033 which is not a
    prime!<br/>
    — I see, being the prime minister you cannot stand having a
    non-prime number on your door even for a few seconds.<br/>
    — Correct! So I must invent a scheme for going from 1033 to
    8179 by a path of prime numbers where only one digit is changed
    from one prime to the next prime.<br/>
<p>Now, the minister of finance, who had been eavesdropping,
    intervened.<br/>
    — No unnecessary expenditure, please! I happen to know that the
    price of a digit is one pound.<br/>
    — Hmm, in that case I need a computer program to minimize the
    cost. You don’t know some very cheap software gurus, do
    you?<br/>
    — In fact, I do. You see, there is this programming contest
    going on<span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span></p>
<p>Help the prime minister to find the cheapest prime path
    between any two given four-digit primes! The first digit must
    be nonzero, of course. Here is a solution in the case
    above.</p>
<pre>
    1033
    1733     
    3733     
    3739     
    3779
    8779
    8179     
</pre>
<p>The cost of this solution is <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> pounds. Note that the digit
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> which got pasted over
    in step <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> can not be
    reused in the last step – a new <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> must be purchased.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>One line with a positive number: the number of test cases
    (at most 100). Then for each test case, one line with two
    numbers separated by a blank. Both numbers are four-digit
    primes (without leading zeros).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>One line for each case, either with a number stating the
    minimal cost or containing the word “<tt class="ttfamily">Impossible</tt>”.</p>
