<p>Luka started driving international routes with his truck.
    His biggest problem is the border with Slovenia. The border is
    a point of entrance into the European Union, so every truck is
    thoroughly examined. Because of this, Luka always has to wait
    several hours there. To kill the time, he comes up with various
    logic and math games.</p>
<p>In one of them, Luka first reads the numbers off of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> license plates and
    writes them down on a piece of paper. Then he tries to find an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> greater than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> such that all integers
    on the paper give the same remainder when divided by
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>. Luka tries to find as
    many such integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> as
    possible.</p>
<p>Write a program that, given Lukaâ€™s <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers, determines all such
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \le N \le 100$</span>), the number of integers on paper. Each
    of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    contains one integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 000$</span> (one billion).
    All these integers will be distinct. The input data will
    guarantee that at least one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> will always exist.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output all integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>
    separated by spaces, in any order.</p>
