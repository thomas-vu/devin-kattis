<p>You are part of a team developing software to help students
    learn basic mathematics. You are to write one part of that
    software, which is to display possibly improper fractions as
    mixed fractions. A proper fraction is one where the numerator
    is less than the denominator; a mixed fraction is a whole
    number followed by a proper fraction. For example the improper
    fraction 27/12 is equivalent to the mixed fraction 2 3/12. You
    should not reduce the fraction (i.e. donâ€™t change 3/12 to
    1/4).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input has one test case per line. Each test case contains
    two integers in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[1,
    2^{31}-1]$</span>. The first number is the numerator and the
    second is the denominator. A line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$0~ 0$</span> will follow the last test
    case.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, display the resulting mixed fraction as
    a whole number followed by a proper fraction, using whitespace
    to separate the output tokens.</p>
