<div class="problembody">
<p>You have decided to start up a new social networking
    company. Other existing popular social networks already have
    billions of users, so the only way to compete with them is to
    include novel features no other networks have.</p>
<p>Your company has decided to market to advertisers a cheaper
    way to charge for advertisements (ads). The advertiser chooses
    which users’ “wall” the ads would appear on, and only those ads
    are charged. When an ad is posted on a user’s wall, all of
    his/her friends (and of course the user himself/herself) will
    see the ad. In this way, an advertiser only has to pay for a
    small number of ads to reach many more users.</p>
<p>You would like to post ads to a particular group of users
    with the minimum cost. You already have the “friends list” of
    each of these users, and you want to determine the smallest
    number of ads you have to post in order to reach every user in
    this group. In this social network, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> is a friend of <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> is also a friend of <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> for any two users <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of
    input is a single integer, not more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, indicating the number of test
    cases to follow. Each case starts with a line containing an
    integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 20$</span>) indicating the
    number of users in the group. For the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th line contains the friend list
    of user <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (users are
    labelled <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, \ldots , n$</span>).
    Each line starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq d &lt; n)$</span> followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> labels of the friends. No user is
    a friend of himself/herself.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, display on a line the minimum number of ads
    needed to be placed in order for them to reach the entire group
    of users.</p>
