<p>Dang it! Your period ticket for the local Bus-Go-On-system
    (BGO) has expired. At first you wanted to buy a new period
    already today, but you suddenly realize that your next ticket
    would then expire a few days before your vacation starts,
    leaving a few trips you need to pay for individually anyways.
    Perhaps it is cheaper to pay for an individual trip now,
    allowing the next period ticket to cover more trips of the
    future?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains four positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq s \leq 10^9$</span>) is the price of a single trip with
    the BGO, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq p \leq 10^9$</span>) is the price of
    a period ticket, <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq 10^9$</span>) is
    the number of days the period ticket will cover, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10^6$</span>) is the number of
    trips you plan to make in the future (until you die, and hence
    wonâ€™t need to pay for any further trips).</p>
<p>On the second line follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> non-negative integers in
    non-decreasing order, <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_1, t_2,
    \ldots , t_ n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_
    i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq t_ i \leq
    10^9$</span>) is the number of days until you will make your
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th trip with the
    BGO.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The smallest possible cost of making the trips.</p>
