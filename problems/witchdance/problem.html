<p>Each Halloween, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    witches of Sweden all gather high up in the air with their
    brooms to perform a magical dance. The dance consists of taking
    one’s broom and rotating clockwise around one of the ends of
    the broom. Each broom is exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\text { m}$</span> long, and everyone
    rotates at the same speed. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th witch originally starts rotated
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i\text { radians}$</span>
    clockwise. <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> radians
    means that the broom points to the right, i.e. positive
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-direction;
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$\pi /2$</span> radians points in
    the positive <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-direction. All the witches are
    located at the same height in the air, at positions
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_ i, y_ i)$</span> for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le i \le N$</span>. Their
    brooms are always parallel to the <span class="tex2jax_process">$x-y$</span> plane.</p>
<p>This dance is very beautiful, but has in recent years been
    plagued by a certain problem. It turns out that nobody had
    choreographed the dance properly. This caused some of the
    witches to crash into each other’s brooms. As a result, their
    brooms would break and they would fall down helplessly, being
    forced to use their parachutes – can you imagine a greater
    embarrassment for a witch?</p>
<p>This year, a coalition of witches are tired of their brooms
    breaking. They have thus produced a choreography beforehand,
    consisting of the original locations and rotations of the
    witches’ brooms. Can you check if the dance will cause any
    brooms to crash into each other?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 200\, 000$</span>), the number
    of witches. The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines contains a description of each broom. Each line consists
    of the real numbers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i, y_
    i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^{9} \le x_ i \le
    y_ i 10^{9}$</span>), and the real number <span class="tex2jax_process">$r_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le r_ i &lt; 2\pi $</span>), all with at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> digits after the
    decimal point. The coordinates are measured in meters, and give
    you the end of the broom that the broom rotates around.</p>
<p>The input will be such that the answer does not change even
    if the length of the brooms were <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 + 10^{-6}\text { m}$</span> long.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <tt class="ttfamily">ok</tt> if no witches will crash
    into each other, and <tt class="ttfamily">crash</tt> if at
    least one pair of witches will crash.</p>
