<p>Dominick Cobb and Arthur are “extractors" who perform
    corporate espionage. Using experimental military technology
    that gives them access to shared dream worlds, they infiltrate
    their targets’ subconscious to extract valuable information.
    Cobb and his entourage are contacted by a mysterious Japanese
    syndicate and given a seemingly impossible task: instead of
    extracting information, do the opposite – plant a new idea in
    the target’s mind.<br/></p>
<p>Cobb just figured out how to calculate the slowness of time
    in each dream level, but he is still missing a vital piece of
    the plan – the architecture. For this challenging mission he
    has hired the brilliant young architect Ariadne to design a
    dream space, complete with all the aesthetic and tactile
    details. Cobb’s target will be brought into that dream space,
    where they will fill it with details from their own
    subconscious and memories.<br/></p>
<p>As extractors go into deeper dream levels, the perception of
    time slows down. This means subjects will be able to explore
    exponentially more space. Since dreams can go infinitely deep
    (onwards to Limbo), the architecture of a dream should be
    infinite in area. The master layout is denoted by a
    two-dimensional grid that starts at row <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, column <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>, and extends infinitely downwards
    and to the right. Ariadne cannot simply draw a map of this
    space (since it is infinite), so she must come up with a
    program that "generates" the dream space to extend as large as
    the team needs to go deeper. She has an infinite number of
    building blocks, numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$0, 1,
    2, 3, 4, \dots $</span>, which must be used in that
    order.<br/></p>
<p>In dream level <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    (reality), the dream space consists of the single block
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>. With each deeper
    dream level, the area of the space doubles. To prevent the
    dream space from implosion due to growing too narrowly in a
    single direction, Ariadne has designed the space to double in
    <i class="itshape">alternating directions</i>, with new blocks
    filling in the space sequentially based on the direction of
    doubling. For example, the first few levels of the dream map
    are depicted as follows:<br/></p>

<p>Ariadne’s program must be able to generate any part of the
    map at will. Given only the row and column coordinates for a
    particular location in the dream space, can you determine the
    number of the building block that will be used?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 100$</span>), the number of
    test cases.<br/>
<span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines follow, each of
    which is a test case consisting of two space-separated
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq R, C \leq 10^{9}$</span>), specifying
    a particular row and column in the dream-space.<br/></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print, on a separate line, the number of
    the building block at coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$(R, C)$</span>.<br/>
    Note: the answer can be large, and may not necessarily fit in a
    32-bit integer.<br/></p>
