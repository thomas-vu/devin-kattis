<p>Today, besides SWERCâ€™11, another important event is taking
    place in Spain which rivals it in importance: General
    Elections. Every single resident of the country aged 18 or over
    is asked to vote in order to choose representatives for the
    Congress of Deputies and the Senate. You do not need to worry
    that all judges will suddenly run away from their supervising
    duties, as voting is not compulsory.</p>
<p>The administration has a number of ballot boxes, those used
    in past elections. Unfortunately, the person in charge of the
    distribution of boxes among cities was dismissed a few months
    ago due to financial restraints. As a consequence, the
    assignment of boxes to cities and the lists of people that must
    vote in each of them is arguably not the best. Your task is to
    show how efficiently this task could have been done.</p>
<p>The only rule in the assignment of ballot boxes to cities is
    that every city must be assigned at least one box. Each person
    must vote in the box to which he/she has been previously
    assigned. Your goal is to obtain a distribution which minimizes
    the maximum number of people assigned to vote in one box.</p>
<p>In the first case of the sample input, two boxes go to the
    first city and the rest to the second, and exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> people are assigned to
    vote in each of the (huge!) boxes in the most efficient
    distribution. In the second case, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, 2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> ballot boxes are assigned to the
    cities and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 700$</span>
    people from the third city will be called to vote in each of
    the two boxes of their village, making these boxes the most
    crowded of all in the optimal assignment.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains at most 3 testcases. The first line of
    each test case contains the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 500\, 000$</span>), the number of cities, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$N \le B \le 2\, 000\, 000$</span>), the
    number of ballot boxes. Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a_ i$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a_ i \le 5\, 000\, 000$</span>),
    indicating the population of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i^{th}$</span> city.</p>
<p>A single blank line will be included after each case. The
    last line of the input will contain <tt class="ttfamily">-1
    -1</tt> and should not be processed.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, your program should output a single integer,
    the maximum number of people assigned to one box in the most
    efficient assignment.</p>
