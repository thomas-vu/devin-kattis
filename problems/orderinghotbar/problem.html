        Hotbar
      </div>
</div>
<p>Dan is an epic gamer attempting his longest speedrun yet.
    Before he makes his attempt, he wants to organize his hotbar so
    that it is easier to use. The hotbar is a list of items that
    are usually displayed on the bottom of the screen that are
    available to the player to use throughout the game. He wants to
    sort the items in his hotbar according to how useful they are.
    He wants the most useful items on the right where he can
    quickly access them, and the least useful ones on the
    left.<br/></p>
<p>Given an array <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers representing
    the utility of each item in the hotbar, sort the items in
    increasing order using the allowed moves. You are allowed to
    remove an item from the list and place it at either end of the
    list (before the first item or after the last one). After
    moving an item to an end, the items in the list shift to fill
    the open space from where the item was removed. Find the least
    number of moves needed to sort the items. You may assume that
    all the items in the array are unique.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line consists of an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n \leq 100\, 000$</span>, giving the
    number of spaces in the hotbar. The second line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> space-separated
    integers, each between <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000\, 000$</span>,
    representing the utility of each item in the hotbar in the
    order that they are present.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line containing a single number, the number of
    moves needed to sort the hotbar.</p>
