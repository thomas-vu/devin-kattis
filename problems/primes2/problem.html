<p>Your maths teacher, Professor Prime, likes writing integers
    on the blackboard at the end of class. You have been taking
    notes all semester, and have noticed two things:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>There is an equal chance of the number being written in
        binary, octal, decimal, and hexadecimal.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There seems to be no apparent connection between
        them.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Professor Prime has given you the task of finding the
    connection between the numbers. He claims that there exists a
    function <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>, such that on
    day <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$f(i)$</span> would produce the number he
    wrote on the blackboard. He seems to think that this task
    should be relatively simple, given that he has been doing it
    for a very long time, and you have a lot of numbers to plug
    into the function.<br/></p>
<p>You have decided not to complete his task, and rather
    calculate the probability that the number is a prime. You donâ€™t
    remember why you decided to do so, but here we are, so I guess
    you just have to do it.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of a single integer,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the number of test
    cases.<br/>
    Each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases
    consists of a single line with a string representing the number
    he wrote that day.<br/></p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq
        200$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each number will consist of the characters <tt class="ttfamily">0-9</tt> and <tt class="ttfamily">A-F</tt>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each number will have between 1 and 10 characters.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Numbers in binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal are
        numbers written in base 2, 8, 10 and 16, respectively.
        Hexadecimal numbers use extra digits <tt class="ttfamily">A-F</tt> for 10-15.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>prime number</em> is an integer greater than 1
        that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the probability that the number
    is a prime as a reduced fraction (that is, the greatest common
    divisor of the numerator and denominator is 1).</p>
