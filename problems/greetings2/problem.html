<p>Now that Snapchat and Slingshot are <em>soooo</em> 2018, the
    teenagers of the world have all switched to the new hot app
    called BAPC (Bidirectional and Private Communication). This app
    has some stricter social rules than previous iterations. For
    example, if someone says goodbye using <tt class="ttfamily">Later!</tt>, the other person is expected to reply
    with <tt class="ttfamily">Alligator!</tt>. You can not keep
    track of all these social conventions and decide to automate
    any necessary responses, starting with the most important one:
    the greetings. When your conversational partner opens with
    <tt class="ttfamily">he…ey</tt>, you have to respond with
    <tt class="ttfamily">hee…eey</tt> as well, but using twice as
    many <tt class="ttfamily">e</tt>’s!</p>
<p>Given a string of the form <tt class="ttfamily">he…ey</tt>
    of length at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\,
    000$</span>, print the greeting you will respond with,
    containing twice as many <tt class="ttfamily">e</tt>’s.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The input consists of one line containing a single
        string <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> as
        specified, of length at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the required response.</p>
