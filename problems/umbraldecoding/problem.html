<div class="problembody">
<p>You are planning a clever attack against a new encryption
    algorithm. To succeed, you need to find the key, which is a
    pair of integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$(p, q)$</span>.
    We can think of the key as a point on a two-dimensional integer
    lattice whose location is unknown. However, you know that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(p, q)$</span> lies in the
    square spanned by the lattice points <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 0)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(n, n)$</span> for a given <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, i.e. <span class="tex2jax_process">$0\leq p,q\leq n$</span>.</p>
<p>Your attack has three stages:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Identify safe points and their bounds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eliminate as key candidates those points that lie in the
        “umbra” of any safe point.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test the remaining points to see which one is the
        key.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Stage 1 has already been performed and you are given several
    safe points of the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y,
    b)$</span> as input.</p>
<p>In Stage 2 you eliminate a point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(p, q)$</span> if it lies in the umbra of
    any safe point. Point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(p,
    q)$</span> is in the umbra of safe point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x, y, b)$</span> if and only
    if</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ |x-p|^3 + |y-q|^3 \leq
    b. \]</span>
<p>Your task in this problem is to count how many points will
    be left for testing in Stage 3 so that we have an estimate of
    the amount of work left to complete the attack.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n, k$</span> on a single line, separated by
    a space, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq n \leq
    100\, 000\, 000$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq k \leq 100$</span>. Following that are <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> lines each containing three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x, y, b$</span>
    separated by spaces, representing the safe points. The values
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> are both in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0,n]$</span>. The bound <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> lies in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[0, n]$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of points <span class="tex2jax_process">$(p, q)$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq p,q \leq n$</span>, that do not lie
    in the umbra of any safe point.</p>
