<div class="problembody">
<p>The <i class="itshape">Shinomiya</i> corporation is Japan’s
    biggest family-owned conglomerate, with a portfolio of multiple
    businesses in railway, trade and retail. With a family of such
    high esteem, it is important to maintain their status and
    image, paramount to stereotypical Asian culture.</p>
<p>The family has a daughter by the name of <i class="itshape">Kaguya</i>, who is in love with and currently dating
    her student council president <i class="itshape">Miyuki
    Shirogane</i>.</p>
<p>However, there is a big issue. <i class="itshape">Miyuki’s</i> family is not very well to do and his
    father works multiple jobs to make ends meet. Upon the
    <i class="itshape">Shinomiya</i> family finding out about this,
    they expressed great displeasure over <i class="itshape">Kaguya</i> and <i class="itshape">Miyuki</i>’s
    relationship. In their eyes, <i class="itshape">Kaguya</i>
    should marry someone of similar status and not lower herself,
    indirectly destroying the family’s reputation.</p>
<p>Much to the annoyance of <i class="itshape">Kaguya’s</i>
    parents, the couple want to stay together due to their undying
    love for one another. Henceforth, <i class="itshape">Kaguya’s</i> parents have devised a scheme to prevent
    <i class="itshape">Miyuki</i> from visiting <i class="itshape">Kaguya</i>.</p>
<p>It is a well known fact that the <i class="itshape">Shinomiya</i> family’s house is located on an
    extremely large plot of land in <i class="itshape">Tokyo</i>.
    More formally, it is modelled as a plot of land with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> junctions and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> roads. Since the
    entire plot of land is owned by the family, it is guaranteed
    that there is a path between any <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> junctions and there is at most one
    road between <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> adjacent
    junctions.</p>
<p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th road is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_{i}$</span> units long, for
    every <span class="tex2jax_process">$i = 1 \dots E$</span>.
    Knowing that <i class="itshape">Miyuki</i> frequently commutes
    on his bicycle and will take a significant amount of energy to
    travel between <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    locations, <i class="itshape">Kaguya’s</i> family’s have
    devised a plan. They will hire a contractor to increase the
    length of some subset of roads. The family wants to increase
    the length of a subset of roads in such a way that <b class="bfseries">increases</b> the total amount of time Miyuki will
    take to travel from the entrance to the actual family house. In
    a single operation, the contractor can increase the duration
    needed to travel through any road by exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> unit of time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, <i class="itshape">Miyuki</i> will always take
    a route from the entrance to the family’s house that can be
    covered in the least amount of time possible.</p>
<p>Being business-minded people, the family are willing to pay
    you a fortune for you to devise a scheme that uses the
    <b class="bfseries">minimum</b> number of operations to
    increase the time that <i class="itshape">Miyuki</i> will take
    to travel from the entrance of the compound to <i class="itshape">Shinomiya’s</i> family’s house. Can you help
    them?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le N \le 2000$</span>, the number of
    junctions, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le E \le 40\,
    000$</span>, the number of roads, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s, d \leq N$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$s \neq d$</span>), the junctions where the
    entrance to the compound, and the <i class="itshape">Shinomiya</i> house, is located, respectively.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$E$</span> lines
    contain the roads, each on one line. Each road is given in the
    form <span class="tex2jax_process">$u\, v\, w$</span> where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$u,v$</span> are the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> endpoints of an road (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq u,v \leq N$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> is the time it takes to traverse
    the road (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le w \le
    10^{9}$</span>). The road can be traversed in both
    directions.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>On <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> line, print the
    minimum number of operations required.</p>
<p>For every road in which the operation is applied at least
    once, print it on a single line in the form of <span class="tex2jax_process">$u\, v\, f$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$u$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> are the endpoints of the edge and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> is the number of times
    the operation is applied.</p>
<p>Each road should be included in the output at most once.
    Roads where the operation is applied <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> times need not be printed.</p>
<p>If there are multiple solutions, print any one of them.</p>
