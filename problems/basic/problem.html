<p>The programming language Ada has integer constants that look
    like this: <tt class="ttfamily">123</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">8#123#</tt>, <tt class="ttfamily">16#abc#</tt>.
    These constants represent the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$123$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$83$</span> (<tt class="ttfamily">123</tt>
    base <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2739$</span> (<tt class="ttfamily">abc</tt>
    base <span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span>). More
    precisely, an integer may be a decimal integer given as a
    sequence of one or more digits less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>, or it may be an integer to some
    specific base, given as the base followed by a sequence of one
    or more digits less than the base enclosed by <tt class="ttfamily">#</tt> symbols. Lower case letters from <tt class="ttfamily">a</tt> through <tt class="ttfamily">f</tt> are used
    as the digits representing <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$15$</span>. In Ada, the base, if specified,
    must be a sequence of decimal digits. For this problem,
    however, the base may be of any form described above so long as
    it represents an integer between <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$16$</span> inclusive.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \le 100$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines follow. Input lines use
    ASCII characters <span class="tex2jax_process">$33$</span>-<span class="tex2jax_process">$126$</span>, and are between <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$80$</span> characters in length.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line of input, output a line “<tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt>” if it is a valid integer constant
    according to the above rules; otherwise output a line
    containing “<tt class="ttfamily">no</tt>”.</p>
