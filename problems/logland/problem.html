<div class="problembody">
<p>Two thieves (who strongly “recommended” us not to reveal
    their names) has broken into the central bank of Logland, where
    the country’s cash reserve is stored. In Logland, the currency
    has the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> denominations
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, 4, 8, \ldots , 2^{k -
    1}$</span>, and the bank currently stores <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span> coins of denominations
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^ i$</span>.</p>
<p>Thieves live by a very strict honor code, which stipulates
    that any loot grabbed must be divided evenly between the
    theives. Unfortunately (for the thieves), this may mean that
    some loot must be left behind. For example, if the bank
    contained a single coin of denomination <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span>, and two coins of denomination
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>, there is no way they
    could bring the <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> coin.
    Instead, they would have to take one coin of value <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> each, leaving more than half of
    the possible loot!</p>
<p>Since neither leaving loot nor solving NP-hard problems are
    things thieves like to do, they have asked you to compute the
    minimum value of the loot they must leave behind, in order to
    be able to split the remaining loot evenly.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le k \le 10^6$</span> – the number of
    denominations in Logland. The next line contains the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x_0, x_1, \dots , x_{k-1} \le
    2^{30}$</span>, the number of coins of the denominations
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^0, 2^1, \dots , 2^{k -
    1}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line, the minimum amount of money the
    thieves must leave behind. Since this number may be very large,
    output it modulo the prime number <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9 + 7$</span>.</p>
