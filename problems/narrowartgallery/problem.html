<div class="problembody">
<p>A long art gallery has <span class="tex2jax_process">$2N$</span> rooms. The gallery is laid out as
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> rows of 2 rooms
    side-by-side. Doors connect all adjacent rooms (north-south and
    east-west, but not diagonally). The curator has been told that
    she must close off <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> of
    the rooms because of staffing cuts. Visitors must be able to
    enter using at least one of the two rooms at one end of the
    gallery, proceed through the gallery, and exit from at least
    one of the two rooms at the other end. Therefore, the curator
    must not close off any two rooms that would block passage
    through the gallery. That is, the curator may not block off two
    rooms in the same row or two rooms in adjacent rows that touch
    diagonally. Furthermore, she has determined how much value each
    room has to the general public, and now she wants to close off
    those <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> rooms that leave
    the most value available to the public, without blocking
    passage through the gallery.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input will consist of multiple problem instances
    (galleries). Each problem instance will begin with a line
    containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$3 \leq N \leq 200$</span> gives the number
    of rows, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq k \leq
    N$</span> gives the number of rooms that must be closed off.
    This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    rows of two integers, giving the values of the two rooms in
    that row. Each roomâ€™s value <span class="tex2jax_process">$v$</span> satisfies <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq v \leq 100$</span>. A line containing
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0~ 0$</span> will follow the
    last gallery.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each gallery, output the amount of value that the
    general public may optimally receive, one line per gallery.</p>
