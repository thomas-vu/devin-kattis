<div class="problembody">
<p>Notch is holding a race for Steve and Alex to see who is the
    better miner. The rules are simple: they must each move
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> blocks forward and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> blocks down. They can
    do this in any order they choose—that is, they each mine
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$2n$</span> times (<span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> blocks in front of them and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> below them) and may
    order these <span class="tex2jax_process">$2n$</span> mining
    steps in any way they want. They will never mine above or
    behind them, as that will just slow them down.<br/></p>
<p>Steve and Alex do not want to take the same mining path, to
    avoid getting in each other’s way or mining blocks for their
    opponent. To avoid this, Alex decides to move <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> blocks behind and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> blocks below Steve before the race
    begins. However, as Steve and Alex start to mine, Notch
    realizes there is a problem with their approach: it is still
    possible that they run into each other’s mining paths during
    the race! For example, consider the following figure:</p>
<div class="figure" id="a0000000004">

          that could lead to a collision.
        </div>
</center>
</div>
<p>Notch wants to know whether or not their paths will
    intersect. Assuming that both Steve and Alex choose their path
    randomly and independently (that is, each chooses a
    randomly-ordered sequence of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> moves forward and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> moves down), what is the
    probability that their paths collide during the race?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a single line containing two integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n,b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq b \leq n \leq 500\, 000$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing the probability of Steve and
    Alex’s mining paths intersecting. Your answer will be
    considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn’t
    exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
