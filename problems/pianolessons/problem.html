</div>Mrs. Mackenzie loves teaching piano. She started
    last year with just five students in her home studio at Green
    Gables in the beautiful province of Prince Edward Island
    (Canada). Pretty soon, kids across the entire province heard
    about her brilliant piano teaching, and now she is receiving
    hundreds of calls requesting lessons. She is finding it very
    difficult to fit them all into her schedule since she has a
    limited number of time slots and students have varying
    availability. While she is baffled by some kids’ irrational
    interest in sports, she respects their prior commitments.
    <p>Given Mrs. Mackenzie’s time slots, and a list of the
    time slots that work for each potential student, can you help
    her determine the maximum number of students she can fit into
    her schedule? Note that Mrs. Mackenzie only teaches
    private lessons (one student at a time) and no student requires
    more than one time slot.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains two space-separated
    integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is the number of potential
    students and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> is the
    number of time slots that Mrs. Mackenzie has available
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N, M \leq 1\,
    000$</span>). These time slots are numbered <span class="tex2jax_process">$1, 2, 3, \ldots , M$</span>. This is
    followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, one
    for each potential student. Each of these <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines begins with an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the number of time
    slots that work for the student (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq T \leq M$</span>), and this is
    followed (on the same line) by <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> distinct space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>, representing the
    specific time slots that work (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq t_ i \leq M$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum number of students Mrs. Mackenzie
    can fit into her <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> time
    slots.</p>
