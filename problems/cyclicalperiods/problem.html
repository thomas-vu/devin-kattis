</div>The image illustrates the superposition of four cycles
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> of differing offsets and periods.
    It can be quickly seen that <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> appears every 3 steps with an
    offset of 3, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> every 4
    steps with an offset of 2, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> every 7 steps with an offset of 5,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> every 11 steps
    with an offset of 4. Cycle <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> can be seen to have the longest
    period. The first sample input describes the case in the image.
    <p>Given a sequence of strings of lowercase letters (arbitrary
    ordering of letters in each string) and their positions on the
    number line, your task is to determine which letter represents
    the cycle with the longest period. The number line will start
    at 1 and will not be longer than <span class="tex2jax_process">$65{,}536$</span>. Any letter that appears
    will appear at least twice, and it will appear on the entire
    number line at locations consistent with its offset and
    period.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq N \leq 65{,}536$</span>), representing the number of
    strings on the number line. Each subsequent line describes a
    position on the number line that has at least one letter
    associated with it. Each description line begins with a
    positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq P \leq 65{,}536$</span>)
    representing the position on the number line followed by a
    space, and then the string of lowercase letters associated with
    this position. No letters will be repeated within a string, and
    the positions are strictly increasing from one line to the
    next.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the single letter that represents the longest cycle
    length. In case of a tie, use the cycle that appears at the
    earliest position. If there is still a tie, use the letter that
    appears first in the string when the cycle is first
    discovered.</p>
