<p>The use of units is ubiquitous in science. Physics uses
    units to distinguish distance (e.g., meters, kilometers, etc.),
    weight (e.g., kilograms, grams), and many other quantities.
    Computer scientists have specialized units to describe storage
    capacity (e.g., kilobytes, megabytes, etc.). You are to write a
    program to display the conversion factors for a set of
    units.</p>
<p>Specifying the relationship between various units can be
    done in many different, but equivalent, ways. For example, the
    units for metric distance can be specified as the group of
    relationships between pairs for units: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> km = <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> m, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> m = <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> cm, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> cm = <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> mm. An alternative set of pairs
    consists of: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> km =
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> cm,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> km = <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span> mm, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> m = <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> mm. In either presentation,
    the same relationship can be inferred: <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> km = <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span> m = <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\, 000$</span> cm = <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000\, 000$</span> mm.</p>
<p>For this problem, the units are to be sorted according to
    their descending size. For example, among the length units cm,
    km, m, mm, km is considered the biggest unit since <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> km corresponds to a length greater
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> cm, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> m, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> mm. The remaining units can be
    sorted similarly. For this set, the sorted order would be: km,
    m, cm, mm.</p>
<p>This problem is limited to unit-systems whose conversion
    factors are integer multiples. Thus, factors such as
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> inch = <span class="tex2jax_process">$2.54$</span> cm are not considered. Further,
    the set of units and the provided conversions are given such
    that all units can be expressed in terms of all other
    units.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several problems. Each problem begins
    with the number of units, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> is an integer in the interval
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$[2, 10]$</span>. The following
    line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> unique
    case-sensitive units, each of which consists of at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> characters (using only
    a–z and A–Z). Following the set of units are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> unique lines, each specifying a
    relationship between two different units, with the format
    containing the following four space-separated pieces: name of
    the unit; an “=”; a positive integer multiplier larger than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>; and the name of a
    second unit that is smaller than the one to the left of the
    equal sign. Each of these lines establishes how many units are
    equivalent to the larger unit on the left. Each unit appears in
    the set of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N-1$</span> lines and
    is given in such a way to ensure the entire system is defined.
    The set of multiples yields conversion factors that do not
    exceed <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{31} - 1$</span>.</p>
<p>The sentinel value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N=0$</span> indicates the end of the
    input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each set of units, produce one line of output that
    contains the equivalent conversions. The conversions should be
    sorted left to right, with the largest unit appearing on the
    left. The conversion factors should be defined with respect to
    the leftmost unit (i.e., the largest unit) and should be
    separated by “ = ”.</p>
