<p>Engineers like to use triangles. It probably has something
    to do with how a triangle can provide a lot of structural
    strength. We can describe the physical structure of some
    designs using an undirected graph. We’ll say vertex
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> is part of a triangle
    if <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> has two different
    neighbors <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> are neighbors of each other. For
    this problem, find <em>weak vertices</em> in graphs – those
    vertices that is not part of any triangle.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> graphs. Each starts with an
    integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 20$</span>,
    giving the number of vertices in the graph. Next come
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers on each line,
    which describe an <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \times
    n$</span> adjacency matrix for the graph. Vertices are numbered
    from <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n - 1$</span>. If the adjacency matrix
    contains a one at row <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>,
    column <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le r, c \le n-1$</span>), it
    means that there is an edge from vertex <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> to vertex <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span>. Since the graph is undirected,
    the adjacency matrix is symmetric. The end of input is marked
    by a value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$-1$</span> for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each graph, produce a line listing the weak vertices
    ordered from least to greatest.</p>
