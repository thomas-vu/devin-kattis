<div class="problembody">
<p>Given a list of phone numbers, determine if it is consistent
    in the sense that no number is the prefix of another. Let’s say
    the phone catalogue listed these numbers:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Emergency 911</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alice 97 625 999</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bob 91 12 54 26</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, it’s not possible to call Bob, because the
    central would direct your call to the emergency line as soon as
    you had dialled the first three digits of Bob’s phone number.
    So this list would not be consistent.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input gives a single integer, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le t \le 40$</span>, the number of test
    cases. Each test case starts with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, the number of phone numbers, on a
    separate line, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq
    10\, 000$</span>. Then follows <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines with one unique phone number
    on each line. A phone number is a sequence of at most ten
    digits. Note that leading zeros in phone numbers are
    significant, e.g., “0911” is a different phone number than
    “911”.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output “YES” if the list is consistent,
    or “NO” otherwise.</p>
