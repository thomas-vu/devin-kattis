<div class="problembody">
<p>You are performing a magic trick with a special deck of
    cards.</p>
<p>You lay out the cards in a row from left to right, face up.
    Each card has a lower-case letter on it. Two cards with the
    same letter are indistinguishable. You select an audience
    member to perform an operation on the cards. You will not see
    what operation they perform.</p>
<p>The audience member can do one of two things—they can either
    select any two cards and swap them, or leave the cards
    untouched.</p>
<p>In order for the trick to succeed, you must correctly guess
    what the audience member did—either you guess that the audience
    member did nothing, or you point at the two cards the audience
    member swapped.</p>
<p>Given a string that represents the initial arrangement of
    the cards, can you guarantee that you will always be able to
    guess the audience member’s operation correctly, no matter what
    operation they perform?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing the string
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le |s| \le 50$</span>), which represents
    the initial arrangement of the cards, in the order they appear
    in the row. The string contains only lower-case letters
    (‘<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>’–‘<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>’).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> if you can guarantee that you will
    always be able to guess the audience member’s operation
    correctly, or <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    otherwise.</p>
