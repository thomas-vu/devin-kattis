<div class="problembody">
<p>A complete binary tree is made of nodes arranged in a
    hierarchic structure. One of the nodes is the root node, said
    to be at level 0. The root node has two child nodes, which are
    at level 1. Each of those has two children at level 2 etc.</p>
<p>In general, a complete binary tree with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> levels has <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^ N - 1$</span> nodes, each of which has
    two child nodes, except those at level <span class="tex2jax_process">$N - 1$</span>.</p>
<p>A number can be written into each node. Write the numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^ N - 1$</span> into a complete binary tree
    with <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> levels so that,
    for each node at level <span class="tex2jax_process">$D$</span>, the absolute value of the
    difference of the sum of all numbers in the left subtree and
    the sum of all numbers in the right subtree is <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^ D$</span>.</p>
<p>For example, the sum of the left subtree of the root node
    must differ from the sum of the right subtree by 1. The sums of
    the left and right subtrees of a node at level 1 must differ by
    2. Each number must be used exactly once. The solution need not
    be unique.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains the integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N (1 \le N \le 15)$</span>, the
    number of levels in the tree.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^ N - 1$</span>
    separated by spaces on a single line, the binary tree in the
    preorder traversal. The preorder traversal first outputs the
    number in the root node, then outputs the left subtree (again
    in the preorder traversal), then the right subtree.</p>
