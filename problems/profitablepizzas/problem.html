<p>A new app available in Calgary allows people to sign-up to
    deliver pizzas in exchange for money. Every first of the month,
    a new list of pizzas to deliver is available. Each entry on the
    list contains the amount of money the delivery-person will earn
    to deliver the pizza, and the deadline in seconds by which the
    pizza must be delivered. If the pizza is delivered after the
    deadline, the delivery-person does not receive any money. Each
    pizza takes one second to deliver and only one can be delivered
    per second. You are the first person to login to this new app
    every month and can select all the pizzas you want to deliver
    before everyone else. Youâ€™d like to maximize the amount of
    money you can make from a given delivery list.</p>
<p>Write the algorithm to find that maximum.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 2\cdot 10^5$</span>, the
    number of pizzas to be delivered.</p>
<p>It is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>
    lines, each containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq t_ i \leq 2\cdot 10^6$</span>
    representing the deadline by which the pizza must be delivered,
    followed by a space, followed by an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d_ i \leq 100$</span> representing
    the amount of money paid for delivering the pizza before the
    deadline.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each query, output the maximum amount of money you can
    get for delivering the pizzas before the deadline.</p>
