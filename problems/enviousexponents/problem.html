<p>Alice and Bob have an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>. Alice and Bob are not happy with
    their integer. Last night they went to a cocktail party and
    found that another couple had the exact same integer! Because
    of that they are getting a new integer.</p>
<p>Bob wants to impress the other couple and therefore he
    thinks their new integer should be strictly larger than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>.</p>
<p>Alice herself is actually fond of some specific integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>. Therefore, Alice
    thinks that whatever integer they pick, it should be possible
    to write it as a sum of <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> distinct powers of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.</p>
<p>Bob is also a cheapskate, therefore he wants to spend as
    little money as possible. Since the cost of an integer is
    proportional to its size, he wants to get an integer that is as
    small as possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>A single line containing two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, with <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10^{18}$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq
        60$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>, the
    smallest integer larger than <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> that can be written as the sum of
    exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> distinct
    powers of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>.</p>
