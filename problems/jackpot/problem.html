<p>Bill has found the perfect way to make money playing the
    slot machines. After months of careful research, he has finally
    figured out the mechanics behind how the machines operate. Now
    he is ready to make profit of his findings.</p>
<p>But first an introduction to the game. A slot machine
    consists of a number of wheels, usually three or four, each
    with a number of symbols printed on it - cherries, oranges,
    bells, etc. - and will show one of its symbols at a given time.
    To play, you insert a coin, push a button and the wheels start
    spinning. After spinning for a while, each wheel stops - at
    random it seems - at one of its symbols. If all wheels stop at
    the same symbol, or some nice combination of symbols, the
    player wins. One combination that is especially desirable is
    having the jackpot symbol on all wheels. This combination is
    simply called ’jackpot’ and will make you rich for life.</p>
<p>What Bill has discovered is that each wheel will stop at the
    jackpot symbol with a certain periodicity, which differs a lot
    between wheels. He has also figured out (after some sneeking
    around at the slot-machine factory) that all newly manufactured
    slot-machines are delivered showing the jackpot combination,
    and that they all have a counter at the back, telling how many
    times the machine has been played. This counter is always set
    to zero at delivery.</p>
<p>Now, all Bill needs to do is to calculate the number of
    times a machine has to be played between two occurrences of the
    jackpot combination. We will call this number the jackpot
    periodicity. This is of course the same as the number of times
    the machine has to be played after leaving the factory, before
    it gives its first jackpot. Thus, with a glance at the counter
    on the back of a machine, Bill can figure out if it is about to
    give a jackpot.</p>
<p>As Bill knows that you are a skillful computer programmer,
    he turns to you with the problem of calculating the jackpot
    periodicity. For each machine, he will give you the number of
    wheels, and the periodicity with which the jackpot symbol shows
    up on each wheel.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>One line with the number of machines <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \le 100$</span>. For each machine, one
    line with the number of wheels <span class="tex2jax_process">$w
    \le 5$</span>, and one line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> numbers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_{1}, \ldots , p_{w}$</span> the
    periodicity of each wheel <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le
    p_{k} \le 10^9$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>One line per machine: The jackpot periodicity of the
    machine, if it is less than or equal to a billion (<span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{9}$</span>), otherwise output the text
    “<tt class="ttfamily">More than a billion.</tt>”.</p>
