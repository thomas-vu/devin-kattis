<p>It’s time for the annual 3-SAT competition, where the
    contestants compete to answer as many instances of 3-SAT as
    possible within the time limit. 3-SAT is a classic NP-complete
    problem, where you are given a boolean formula in
    <em>conjunctive normal form</em>, in which we have a set of
    <em>clauses</em> each consisting of exactly three
    <em>literals</em>. Each literal refer either positively or
    negatively to a <em>variable</em>, which can be assigned a
    value of either <tt class="ttfamily">True</tt> or <tt class="ttfamily">False</tt>. The question is whether there exists an
    assignment to the variables such that every clause evaluates to
    <tt class="ttfamily">True</tt>. No clause will contain
    duplicates of a literal (however it is possible that a clause
    contain both <span class="tex2jax_process">$\neg x_ i$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ i$</span>). An example of
    a 3-SAT instance is shown below (from sample input
    1):</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ (\neg x_1 \vee x_2 \vee
    x_3) \wedge (\neg x_1 \vee \neg x_2 \vee x_3) \wedge (x_1 \vee
    \neg x_2 \vee x_3) \wedge (x_1 \vee \neg x_2 \vee \neg x_3)
    \wedge (x_1 \vee x_2 \vee \neg x_3) \]</span>

</div>Øyvind is a judge in the competition, responsible for
    verifying the quality of problem instances crafted by the other
    judges before the contest starts. Øyvind hates 3-SAT instances
    with less than eight clauses – as these are always satisfiable
    they provide no real challenge for the contestants. Therefore,
    he will deem such problem instances to be unsatisfactory.
    Whenever Øyvind encounters an instance with eight or more
    clauses he knows that it is a real challenge to figure out
    whether this instance is satisfiable or not – and therefore he
    will judge these problem instances to be satisfactory. Given an
    instance of 3-SAT, can you help find Øyvind’s judgement?
    <h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a single instance of the 3-SAT problem. The
    first line is two space-separated integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq m \leq 20$</span>), the number of clauses and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \leq n \leq 20$</span>), the number of variables. Then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> clauses follow, one
    clause per line. Each clause consists of 3 distinct
    space-separated integers in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-n, n] \setminus \{ 0\} $</span>. For each
    clause, the three values correspond to the three literals in
    the clause. If the literal is negative, that means that the
    clause is satisfied if the corresponding variable is set to
    <tt class="ttfamily">False</tt>, and if it is positive the
    clause is satisfied if the variable is set to <tt class="ttfamily">True</tt>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print “<tt class="ttfamily">satisfactory</tt>” on a single
    line if Øyvind finds the 3-SAT instance to be satisfactory, and
    “<tt class="ttfamily">unsatisfactory</tt>” otherwise.</p>
