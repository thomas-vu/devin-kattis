</div>Infinite Compression Plan Consortium (ICPC) has developed
    a new, great data compression strategy, called “Don’t Repeat
    Yourself” (DRY). DRY works on a string of characters, and if
    the string contains two consecutive instances of the same
    substring, it simply removes one of them. For example, in the
    string “<tt class="ttfamily">alfalfa seeds</tt>”, it could
    remove one of the two “<tt class="ttfamily">e</tt>” substrings
    in “<tt class="ttfamily">seeds</tt>”, and one of the two
    “<tt class="ttfamily">lfa</tt>” substrings in “<tt class="ttfamily">alfalfa</tt>”, resulting in “<tt class="ttfamily">alfa seds</tt>”. DRY can also take advantage of
    previous removals — for instance, in the string “<tt class="ttfamily">seventeenth baggage</tt>”, it will first remove the
    duplicate “<tt class="ttfamily">e</tt>” in “<tt class="ttfamily">seventeenth</tt>” and the duplicate “<tt class="ttfamily">g</tt>” in “<tt class="ttfamily">baggage</tt>”,
    resulting in “<tt class="ttfamily">sevententh bagage</tt>”, and
    then remove the duplicate “<tt class="ttfamily">ent</tt>” in
    “<tt class="ttfamily">sevententh</tt>” and “<tt class="ttfamily">ag</tt>” in “<tt class="ttfamily">bagage</tt>”,
    resulting in “<tt class="ttfamily">seventh bage</tt>”.
    <p>If there are multiple choices of repeating consecutive
    substrings to remove, DRY should choose in a way that results
    in the shortest possible final string. For example, in the
    string “<tt class="ttfamily">ABBCDCABCDCD</tt>”, DRY has two
    choices — either removing the repeated “<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>” near the beginning, or the repeated
    “<tt class="ttfamily">CD</tt>” at the end. If the “<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>” is removed, then DRY will be able to remove
    the repeated “<tt class="ttfamily">ABCDC</tt>”, resulting in
    “<tt class="ttfamily">ABCDCD</tt>”, from which the “<tt class="ttfamily">CD</tt>” at the end will finally be removed,
    resulting in “<tt class="ttfamily">ABCD</tt>”. However, if DRY
    removed the “<tt class="ttfamily">CD</tt>” at the end first, it
    would be left with “<tt class="ttfamily">ABBCDCABCD</tt>”, from
    which only the repeated “<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>” can be
    removed to obtain “<tt class="ttfamily">ABCDCABCD</tt>” — and
    from that string nothing more can be removed. So, the correct
    choice for DRY is to begin by compressing the double
    “<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>”, and to finally end up with
    “<tt class="ttfamily">ABCD</tt>”.</p>
<p>ICPC observed that DRY obtains the best results on binary
    strings — that is, strings composed only of zeroes and ones.
    So, it has tasked you with implementing the best possible DRY
    algorithm working on binary strings. For any binary string, you
    should output a shortest string that can be obtained by
    repeatedly applying DRY to it.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing a nonempty
    string of length less than or equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^5$</span>, consisting only of zeroes and
    ones.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line, containing a shortest possible result of
    running DRY on the input string. If there is more than one
    possible shortest result, any one will be accepted.</p>
