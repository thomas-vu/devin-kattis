<p>Theta likes to play Lure of the Labyrinth, which is an
    online game that uses a compelling graphic novel storyline to
    engage middle grades students in mathematical thinking and
    problem-solving. To find lost pets, students have to infiltrate
    a world of monsters and solve puzzles! Implemented by a
    professional game studio, these puzzles are quite engaging and
    challenging.</p>
<p>In the manager’s cafeteria, students are asked to practice
    proportions by serving <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>
    monsters sitting at the table: Salamander, Yeti, Golem, Imp,
    and Kraken. Each monster wants some amount of burger, slop,
    sushi, and drumstick.</p>
<p>The amount of each item each monster wants on their plate is
    proportional to the amount of each of the other items that
    monster wants, and the proportionality ratio is the same for
    all monsters.</p>
<p>For instance, as shown in sample input <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and in the accompanying figure, if
    Golem (center) wants <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>
    units of burger on his plate and <span class="tex2jax_process">$12$</span> units of drumstick, and
    Salamander (left) wants <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span> units of drumstick, then
    Salamander will want <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>
    units of burger. Students practicing proportions will program
    the dispenser machine to release <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span> units of burger. Similarly,
    Kraken (right) wants <span class="tex2jax_process">$36$</span>
    units of drumstick because it has <span class="tex2jax_process">$81$</span> units of slop on its plate and
    Salamander has <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span> units
    of drumstick and <span class="tex2jax_process">$90$</span>
    units of slop. If the students compute all proportions in time,
    the monsters eat and a pet can be saved!</p>
<p>As students progress in the game and reach more difficult
    levels, fewer and fewer amounts are given, requiring more
    intuition and thinking to solve the puzzle.</p>
<p>Give a set of partially filled plates, write a program that
    computes the amount of food for the remaining slots!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> lines of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> entries each describing the
    partially filled plates. The first line describes the top row
    (burgers and slop), the second line describes the bottom row
    (sushi and drumstick). On each line, the first <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> entries describe Salamander’s
    plate, the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>
    Yeti’s, then Golem’s, Imp’s, and finally Kraken’s. Each entry
    is either the underscore character <tt class="ttfamily">_</tt>
    describing an empty slot or a positive integer number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 &lt; a \le 200$</span>) if it is already
    known. Entries are separated by single spaces. There are at
    least <span class="tex2jax_process">$8$</span> slots given. You
    may assume that all plates have at least one non-empty slot,
    and that for each kind of food there exists one plate where its
    amount is known.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output two lines showing how many units of food should be on
    each plate in the same format as given in the input: the top
    line lists the amounts of burgers and slop for each plate, the
    bottom line lists the amounts of sushi and drumstick. Separate
    each amount with a space.</p>
