</div>The <em>Circle-Square Fractal</em>, or
    <em>CS Fractal</em> (which also goes by other names), is a
    simple two-dimensional fractal constructed in an iterative
    fashion out of solid circles of decreasing radii. As the
    construction proceeds, certain square regions become noticeable
    (in particular, the entire fractal), hence the “Square” part of
    the name.
    <p>The <span class="tex2jax_process">$1^{\mathrm{st}}$</span>
    iteration in the construction of the CS Fractal consists
    of a single circle of radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$r
    &gt; 0$</span>. In the <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{\mathrm{nd}}$</span> iteration, this
    “parent” circle spawns four “child” circles of radius
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r/2$</span> that are tangent to
    the parent circle in each of the north, south, east, and west
    directions. Now let <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$n \geq 3$</span></span>.
    In the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n^{\mathrm{th}}$</span>
    iteration, each circle <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> added in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(n-1)^{\mathrm{st}}$</span> iteration spawns
    <em>three</em> child circles whose radii are exactly half of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>’s radius, and that are
    tangent to <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> in each of
    the three compass directions <em>other than the direction in
    which <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> touches its
    parent circle</em> (here the compass directions are relatively
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>). For example,
    in the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3^{\mathrm{rd}}$</span>
    iteration, the circle <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>
    of radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$r/2$</span> that is
    north of the <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$1^\mathrm {st}$</span>-generation</span>
    circle spawns three circles of radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$r/4$</span> that touch <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> in its west, north, and east
    directions. The illustration accompanying this problem depicts
    the CS Fractal after <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> iterations. (Technically, the
    fractal is the shape generated after infinitely many
    iterations, but we informally use “fractal” to refer to the
    partially constructed shape after a finite number of
    iterations.)</p>
<p>Given the radius of the starting <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$1^{\mathrm{st}}$</span>-iteration)</span>
    circle and the number of iterations, determine the area of the
    partially constructed fractal.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> Other than the single-point intersection
    between any child circle and its parent, no two circles in the
    fractal intersect.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>, the number of test cases
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 50$</span>). This
    is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines, one per test case,
    each of which contains two space-separated integers,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq r \leq
    200$</span></span>, <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq
    50$</span>)</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is the radius of the starting
    <span class="mbox" style="width:">(<span class="tex2jax_process">$1^{\mathrm{st}}$</span>-iteration)</span>
    circle and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the
    number of iterations.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the area of the partially
    constructed fractal with starting radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> after <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> iterations. Each computed area
    will be considered correct if it is within <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> of the official answer.</p>
