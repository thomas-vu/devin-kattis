<p>Polly, the programming parrot, has escaped. As Johan is in
    desperate need for some programming skill, he wants to find
    her. The only clue that Johan has about the escape route is
    that Polly flew into his kitchen.</p>
<p>Johan has <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> boxes on
    his kitchen table, and each box has a certain probability to
    contain the parrot. Each box also requires a certain amount of
    energy in order to be opened. Checking all the boxes would for
    sure find the disobedient parrot, but there is a problem. Johan
    is a very lazy person, and he wants to spend as little energy
    as possible while trying to find Polly. Aware of his own
    laziness, Johan decided that he will be satisfied with finding
    the parrot with at least probability <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, as long as he minimizes the
    energy wasted in opening boxes. Can you help him?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 10^3$</span>, the number of
    boxes in Johanâ€™s kitchen and a floating point number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq P \leq 1$</span>, the
    minimum probability with which Johan wants to find Polly. Then
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines follow: each
    line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq e_ i \leq 10^3$</span> describing the amount of energy
    needed to open box <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>,
    and a floating point number <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq p_ i \leq 1$</span> describing the probability that Polly
    is inside box number <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.
    All probabilities are given with at most four digits after the
    decimal point.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output should contain a single integer on a single line: the
    minimum amount of energy Johan has to waste while finding Polly
    with at least probability <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>.</p>
