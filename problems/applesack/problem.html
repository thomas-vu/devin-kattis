<div class="problembody">
<p>Johnny Applesack has grown his seeds into trees and
    harvested all the apples. He has a huge pile of <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> apples next to him, a sack that
    can hold <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> apples at a
    time, and an infinitely long, straight road in front of him. At
    each kilometer mark of the road there is a toll booth. If he
    passes the toll booth in the direction that brings him further
    away from where he started, he has to pay one apple. Otherwise
    he will not be allowed to pass. If he passes the other way, he
    does not have to pay. Johnny is allowed to leave piles of
    apples wherever he wants and pick them up later. Help Johnny
    figure out how many kilometers he can travel.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line with two space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of kilometers he can travel down the
    road.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq N \leq 1\, 000\,
        000$</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq K \leq 1\, 000\,
        000$</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example explanation</h2>
<p>One way of solving the first example input would be to pick
    up <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> apples, go to right
    before the <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> kilometer
    mark, dump the remaining two apples (having paid one at each of
    the toll booths at kilometer mark <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>). Then go back to the pile and
    pick up the rest of the apples, and do the same again. This
    leaves him at <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>
    kilometers with <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>
    apples. He can then go an additional <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> kilometers, paying at the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span> kilometer marks. He will be
    stopped at the <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span>
    kilometer mark because he has no apples left.</p>
