<p>Bessie the Cow has stolen Farmer John’s tractor and is
    running wild on the coordinate plane! She, however, is a
    terrible driver, and can only move according to the following
    rules:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p>Each of her movements is in the same direction as either
        the positive <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>-axis
        or the positive <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>-axis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Her <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>th movement
        takes her <span class="tex2jax_process">$2^{n-1}$</span>
        units forward in her chosen direction. (On her first
        movement, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=1$</span>, so
        she moves <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
        unit.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Farmer John’s farm is on the coordinate plane, in the shape
    of a rectangle with corners at <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(A,0)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,B)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(A,B)$</span>. If Bessie starts at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span>, how many points
    inside the farm, including the boundary, could she reach?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input begins with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N\le 100$</span>) on a line by itself, indicating the
    number of test cases that follow. Each of the following
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains two
    space separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le A, B\le 10^8$</span>), describing the
    upper-right corner of Farmer John’s farm.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines, with
    the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>th line containing
    the number of points that Bessie could possibly reach in the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>th test case.</p>
<p>In the first test case of the sample, Bessie can reach the
    following six points: <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,1)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,0)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,2)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(2,1)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,3)$</span>.</p>
