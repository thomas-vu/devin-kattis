<p>A long time ago, the Egyptians figured out that a triangle
    with sides of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span> had a right angle as its largest
    angle. You must determine if other triangles have a similar
    property.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input represents several test cases (at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 000$</span>), followed by a line
    containing <tt class="ttfamily">0 0 0</tt>. Each test case has
    three positive integers, at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$30\, 000$</span>, denoting the lengths of
    the sides of a triangle.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, a line containing “right” if the
    triangle is a right triangle, and a line containing “wrong” if
    the triangle is not a right triangle.</p>
