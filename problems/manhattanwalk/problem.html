<div class="problembody">
<p>It’s a grid system! You begin at the top left corner and
    want to walk to the bottom right corner. Every location is at
    integer coordinates, and has an arrow pointing down or right
    and a timer that, every few seconds, flips the arrow from down
    to right, or from right to down. When you begin your walk,
    every arrow is pointing down or right with equal probability,
    and every timer has a real value chosen uniformly in the range
    from zero to its maximum wait time.</p>
<p>At any moment in time, if you are at a given location, you
    can:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>Move down one location if the new location is on the
        grid and the arrow is pointing down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Move right one location if the new location is on the
        grid and the arrow is pointing right.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait for the timer to finish its countdown so that the
        arrow flips from down to right, or from right to down.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When you arrive at a new location, you are able to see the
    timer and can therefore take that into account when deciding
    which action to take. However, you are not able to look
    ahead—you can only see the timer and arrow for the exact grid
    point you occupy. You hate waiting, and want to minimize the
    total amount of time you’re waiting for an arrow to flip.</p>
<p>What is the expected amount of time you have to wait if you
    make decisions optimally?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The single line of input contains three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq r, c \leq 10^3$</span>), and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq p \leq 10^9$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is the number of rows in the grid,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> is the number of
    columns in the grid, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is the maximum value a timer can
    show.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single number, which is the expected time you have
    to wait if you make optimal decisions. Your answer will be
    accepted if the absolute or relative error is within
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> of the judge’s
    answer.</p>
