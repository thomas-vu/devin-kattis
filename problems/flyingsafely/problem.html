</center>Due to budget cuts, even spies have to use commercial
    airlines nowadays to travel between cities in the world.
    Although this mode of travel can be very convenient for a spy,
    it also raises a problem: the spy has to trust the pilot to
    make sure he is not in danger during the flight. And even
    worse, sometimes there is no direct flight between some pairs
    of cities, so that the spy has to take multiple flights to get
    to the desired location, and thus has to trust multiple pilots!

    <p>To limit the trust issues you are asked for help. Given the
    flight schedule, figure out the smallest set of pilots that
    need to be trusted, such that the spy can safely travel between
    all cities.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2\le n \le 1\, 000$</span>) and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le m \le 10\, 000$</span>): the number
        of cities and the number of pilots, respectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines with two
        space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le a,b \le n, a \neq b$</span>): a
        pilot flying his plane back and forth between city
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible to go from any city to any other city using
    one or more flights. In other words: the graph is
    connected.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with one integer: the minimum number of pilots
        that need to be trusted such that it is possible to travel
        between each pair of cities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
