<div class="problembody">
<p>You have just moved from a quiet Waterloo neighbourhood to a
    big, noisy city. Instead of getting to ride your bike to school
    every day, you now get to walk and take the subway. Because you
    donâ€™t want to be late for class, you want to know how long it
    will take you to get to school.</p>
<p>You walk at a speed of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> km/h. The subway travels at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$40$</span> km/h. Assume that you
    are lucky, and whenever you arrive at a subway station, a train
    is there that you can board immediately. You may get on and off
    the subway any number of times, and you may switch between
    different subway lines if you wish. All subway lines go in both
    directions.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> coordinates of your home and
    your school, followed by specifications of several subway
    lines. Each subway line consists of the non-negative integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span> coordinates of
    each stop on the line, in order. You may assume the subway runs
    in a straight line between adjacent stops, and the coordinates
    represent an integral number of metres. Each line has at least
    two stops. The end of each subway line is followed by the dummy
    coordinate pair <span class="tex2jax_process">$(-1,-1)$</span>.
    In total there are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$200$</span> subway stops in the city.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output is the number of minutes it will take you to get to
    school, rounded to the nearest minute, taking the fastest
    route.</p>
