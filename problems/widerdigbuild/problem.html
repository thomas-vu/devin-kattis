<div class="problembody">
<p>Benni is once more playing the game Digbuild. Before he
    looked at how a tunnel of width <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> could be illuminated, but this
    time we are looking at a tunnel of width <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>. A tunnel of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and width <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> has a floor which can be split
    into <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \times k$</span> squares.
    Torches can be placed on squares, so each square can either
    have a torch or not. There are no constraints on the total
    number of torches, placing no torches is valid. However it is
    not valid to place torches on adjacent squares. Squares are
    considered adjacent if they share a side, not if they share a
    corner.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input contains two positive
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$k, n$</span> which
    satisfy <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq 10$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq
    10^{18}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the number of ways to place torches on <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \times k$</span> squares satisfying the
    constraints above. The answer might be very large, so print it
    modulo <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9 + 7$</span>.</p>
