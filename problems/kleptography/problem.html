<p>John likes simple ciphers. He had been using the “Caesar”
    cipher to encrypt his diary until recently, when he learned a
    hard lesson about its strength by catching his sister Mary
    browsing through the diary without any problems.</p>
<p>Rapidly searching for an alternative, John found a solution:
    the famous “Autokey” cipher. He uses a version that takes the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$26$</span> lower-case letters
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>’–‘<tt class="ttfamily">z</tt>’ and
    internally translates them in alphabetical order to the numbers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$25$</span>.</p>
<p>The encryption key <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>
    begins with a secret prefix of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> letters. Each of the remaining
    letters of the key is copied from the letters of the plaintext
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, so that <span class="tex2jax_process">$k_{n+i} = a_{i}$</span> for <span class="tex2jax_process">$i \geq 1$</span>. Encryption of the
    plaintext <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> to the
    ciphertext <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> follows the
    formula <span class="tex2jax_process">$b_ i = a_ i + k_ i \bmod
    26$</span>.</p>
<p>Mary is not easily discouraged. She was able to get a peek
    at the last <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> letters
    John typed into his diary on the family computer before he
    noticed her, quickly encrypted the text document with a click,
    and left. This could be her chance.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 30$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$n + 1 \le m \le 100$</span>), where
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the length of
        the keyword as well as the number of letters Mary saw, and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the length of
        the text.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
        lower-case letters, the last <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> letters of the plaintext.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line with <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>
        lower-case letters, the whole ciphertext.</p>
</li>
</ul>
