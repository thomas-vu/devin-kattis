<p><em>On our planet, Jamcode IX, three Great Events occurred.

    slarboseconds, the amount of time since all of those events
    will be multiples of <span class="tex2jax_process">$5\,
    000$</span> slarboseconds, the largest possible amount… and the
    apocalypse will come.</em></p>
<p>Luckily for you, you live on Jamcode X! The apocalypse came
    on Jamcode IX less than a year ago. But Jamcode X has a
    worrying prophecy: “After the moment of reckoning, on the first
    <em>optimum anniversary</em> of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> Great Events, the apocalypse will
    come. <span class="tex2jax_process">$64$</span> bits will not
    save you. You have been warned.”</p>
<p>The people of Jamcode X are very concerned by this prophecy.
    All of the Great Events have already happened, and their times
    have been measured to the nearest slarbosecond; but nobody
    knows when their <em>optimum anniversary</em> will occur. After
    studying the diary of a scientist from Jamcode IX, scientists
    working on the problem have come up with a theory:</p>
<p>The <em>moment of reckoning</em> is now, the moment you
    solve this problem. At some time <span class="tex2jax_process">$y \geq 0$</span> slarboseconds from now, the
    number of slarboseconds since each of the Great Events will be
    divisible by some maximum number <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>. If you can find the smallest
    value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> that gives
    this largest possible <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>,
    that will give you the <em>optimum anniversary</em> when the
    apocalypse will come.</p>
<p>On Jamcode IX, for example, there were 3 Great Events and
    they happened <span class="tex2jax_process">$26\, 000$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$11\, 000$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$6\, 000$</span> slarboseconds
    before the moment of reckoning. <span class="tex2jax_process">$4\, 000$</span> slarboseconds later, the
    amount of time since each event was a multiple of <span class="tex2jax_process">$T=5\, 000$</span> slarboseconds, and the
    apocalypse came.</p>
<p>Your job is to compute the amount of time until the
    apocalypse comes. But remember the prophecy: even though the
    people of Jamcode X have been solving problems for two years,
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$64$</span>-bit integers have
    always been enough, they might not always be enough now or in
    the future.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> lines follow. Each starts with a
    single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, which
    is followed by a space and then <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> space-separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i$</span>, the number of
    slarboseconds since Great Event <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> occurred.</p>
<p>You can assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq C
    \leq 100$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i \not= t_
    j$</span> for some <span class="tex2jax_process">$i, j$</span>.
    Furthermore, <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 1\,
    000$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq t_ i \leq
    10^{50}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing “Case
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>: <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>”, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is the case number (starting from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> is the minimum number of
    slarboseconds until <span class="tex2jax_process">$t_ i +
    y$</span> is a multiple of the largest possible integer factor
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> for all <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.</p>
