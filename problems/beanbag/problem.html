<div class="problembody">
<p>Jack, naïve fellow that he is, has fallen into the clutches
    of a dastardly and sophisticated multi-level marketing
    scheme.</p>
<p>It all started when a mysterious stranger pushed upon young
    Jack a bag of ordinary beans, promising that if only he could
    amass the right quantities of each kind of bean, he could grow
    a mighty beanstalk and climb it to the unimaginable wealth at
    its top.</p>
<p>This all sounds very sensible to Jack... But there is one
    catch. He must acquire the extra beans from other farmers, who
    as one might expect are not too keen to give away the fruits
    (nor the seeds) of their labour. Each time Jack comes to ask
    for a bean, they will give him exactly one from their farm, but
    since he is not a paying customer the exact species may vary
    between farmers and between visits.</p>
<p>There is another option, but it is expensive. Jack can give
    up some of his cows to the mysterious stranger in exchange for
    one additional bean per cow. Of course, this is a drastic
    measure. We would like to help Jack keep as many of his cows as
    possible, while still achieving his goals.</p>
<p>How many cows will Jack need to budget for to have
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\% $</span> certainty of
    success?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le B \le 20$</span>), the number of
        types of beans available.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$V_1 \ldots V_ B$</span>, (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le V_1 \ldots V_ B \le 100$</span>),
        the number of each kind of bean required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le T \le 100$</span>), the number of
        other farms in Jack’s small village.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> more lines,
        each beginning with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le M \le B$</span>) giving the number
        of kinds of bean this farmer grows. This is followed by
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> more distinct
        integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_1 \ldots T_
        M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le T_1 \ldots
        T_ M \le B$</span>), each corresponding to one kind of
        bean.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line containing one integer: the number of cows Jack
        must bring with him in order to be <span class="tex2jax_process">$100\% $</span> sure of ending the day
        with enough beans to grow a magical beanstalk.</p>
