<p>Michael works in a bakery. At the end of his shift, his boss
    wants the breads sorted in a certain order. She can’t seem to
    decide on which order, though – every day there seems to be a
    new one – to Michael’s despair. Michael has worked there for a
    while now and has learned a neat trick with his wooden bakery
    paddle. He can take three breads next to each other on his
    paddle and throw them up in the air such that when they land,
    the right-most has moved to the left-most position, and the two
    other breads have moved one place to the right. In other words,
    he can rotate to the right a subsequence of breads of length
    three.</p>
<p>Before the end of the shift, his coworkers place the breads
    in a long line. Michael would like to sort the line of breads
    using his paddle trick. He can take any three consecutive
    breads along the line on his paddle, rotate them, and then put
    them back. Sometimes though, it does not matter how many times
    he uses his paddle – the line of bread just doesn’t seem to be
    possible to sort the way the boss wants…</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N, (3 \leq N \leq 100\,
    000)$</span>, denoting the number of breads. Then two lines
    follow: On the first line, a permutation of the integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> describing the order in which the
    breads are lined up. On the second line, a permutation of the
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> through
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> describing how
    Michael’s boss wants the breads sorted.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “<tt class="tt">Possible</tt>” if Michael can sort
    the breads with his paddle in the order prescribed by his boss,
    otherwise “<tt class="tt">Impossible</tt>”.</p>
