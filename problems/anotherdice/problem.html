<p>In the game <em>Pickomino</em><a class="footnote" href="#a0000000066"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> one has to
    throw 8 dice to reach at least a certain target score. The
    rules are as follows:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The dice contain the values <tt>1</tt>, <tt>2</tt>,
        <tt>3</tt>, <tt>4</tt>, <tt>5</tt> and <tt>worm</tt>. The
        dice are fair, so all outcomes are equally likely.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The game is started by throwing all dice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a throw, the player must pick one of the six
        possible values and put all dice with this value aside.
        There must be at least one die with this value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After putting some dice aside, the player may choose to
        either throw the remaining dice again or stop. The player
        may only stop after at least one <tt>worm</tt> has been put
        aside.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each possible value may only be chosen once during the
        game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the player stops, his total score is the sum of the
        values of the dice that were put aside. A <tt>worm</tt> is
        worth 5 points.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The player can get stuck by throwing only values that
        were already put aside, by having put all dice aside but
        not having a <tt>worm</tt> or by not having reached the
        target score.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the player is stuck he scores 0 points and the game
        is ended.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Jan is playing Pickomino and wants to score at least
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> points. When Jan uses
    an optimal strategy, what is the probability that he reaches
    this target?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>On the first line one positive number: the number of test
    cases, at most 100. After that per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1\le n \le 40)$</span>: the target
        value.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Per test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with a floating point number: the probability
        that you score at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> points when using an optimal
        strategy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This number should be accurate up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> relative or absolute
    precision.</p>
