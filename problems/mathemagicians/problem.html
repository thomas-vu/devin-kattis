<div class="problembody">
<p>There are <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    mathemagicians standing in a circle. Each mathemagician wears
    either a blue hat or a red hat. A mathemagician can cast a
    color change charm which changes the color of their hat to the
    same color as the hat of the mathemagician directly to the left
    or to the right of them (the caster of the spell may choose
    which one of them). Note that mathemagicians are polite people
    and do not like interrupting each other, so only one
    mathemagician at a time may perform mathemagic.</p>
<p>The mathemagicians are not happy with their current hat
    configuration, so they would like to use the color change charm
    repeatedly to enter another hat configuration. Time isn’t an
    issue because they can conjure cookies to eat.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$3
    \leq n \leq 10^5$</span>), the number of mathemagicians. The
    next contains a string of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. If the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th mathemagician wears a blue hat
    in the beginning, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th character of the string is
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>’, otherwise the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th character is ‘<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>’. Finally, the third line contains a string
    of length <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. If the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th mathemagician would
    like to wear a blue hat in the end, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th character of the string is
    ‘<tt class="ttfamily">B</tt>’, otherwise the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>th character is ‘<tt class="ttfamily">R</tt>’.</p>
<p>It is guaranteed that not every mathemagician is happy with
    their hat color in the beginning.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output “<tt class="ttfamily">yes</tt>” if it is possible for
    the mathemagicians to achieve the desired hat configuration
    after a finite number of color change charms, otherwise output
    “<tt class="ttfamily">no</tt>”.</p>
