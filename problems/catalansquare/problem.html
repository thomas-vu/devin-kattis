<p>Last weekend you and your friends went to visit the local
    farmer’s market at the town square. As you were standing around
    in a circle talking, you couldn’t help overhearing two of your
    friends musing over what sounded like an interesting problem:
    They were considering the number of ways in which you could all
    shake hands, such that everyone in the circle simultaneously
    shaked hands with one other person, but where no arms crossed
    each other.</p>
<p>After a few seconds’ thought you decided to join your two
    friends, to share (with them) the solution to their problem.
    “If we are <span class="tex2jax_process">$2n$</span> persons”,
    you said, “pick any particular person, and let that person
    shake hands with somebody. That person will have to leave an
    even number of people on each side of the person with whom
    he/she shakes hands. Of the remaining <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> pairs of people, he/she can
    leave zero on the right and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-1$</span> pairs on the left, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> on the right and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n-2$</span> pairs on the left, and so on.
    The pairs remaining on the right and left can independently
    choose any of the possible non-crossing handshake patterns, so
    the count <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ n$</span> for
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> pairs of people is
    given by:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ C_ n = C_{n-1}C_0
    + C_{n-2}C_1 + \ldots + C_1C_{n-2} + C_0C_{n-1}, \]</span>
<p>which, together with the fact that <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_0=C_1=1$</span>, is just the definition of
    the Catalan numbers.” By consulting your handy combinatorics
    book, you find out that there is a much more efficient formula
    for calculating <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ n$</span>,
    namely:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ C_ n = \frac{\binom
    {2n}{n}}{n+1}. \]</span>
<p>After a collective groan from the group, your particularly
    cheeky friend Val called out “Well, since we are at the town
    square, why don’t you try to square your Catalan numbers!”.
    This was met with much rejoicing, while you started to think
    about how to square the <em>Catalan sequence</em>…</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Let <span class="tex2jax_process">$C_ n$</span> be the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>th Catalan number as
    defined above. By regarding the sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$(C_ n)_{n\geq 0}$</span> of Catalan numbers,
    we can define a sequence <span class="tex2jax_process">$(S_
    n)_{n\geq 0}$</span>, corresponding to “squaring the Catalan
    sequence”, by considering the Cauchy product, or discrete
    convolution, of <span class="tex2jax_process">$(C_ n)_{n\geq
    0}$</span> with itself, i.e.,</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ S_ n = \sum _{k=0}^{n}C_ kC_{n-k}.
    \]</span>
<p>Your task is to write a program for calculating the number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ n$</span>.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000004"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a></p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains one line containing one non-negative
    integer: <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, with
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq n \leq 5\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_
    n$</span>.</p>
