<div class="problembody">
<p>Write a program which will read lines of text and print the
    text in a triangle.</p>
<p>In particular, no line begins or ends with a space. There is
    exactly one space between words on the same line if they are
    part of the same sentence. There are exactly two spaces
    following a period on a line if the next sentence starts on the
    same line. No word is split between different lines. No period
    appears at the start of a line and the character before each
    period is a letter.</p>
<p>Finally, the words in the input should be presented in
    triangular format. That is, the last row of the triangle
    consists of a single word. All other rows are to contain the
    minimum number of words needed in order to make that row longer
    than the row below (spaces and periods do count toward the
    length of the row). Any excess words should be placed in the
    first row. Of course, the words have to appear in the same
    order as they do in the input.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of a collection of sentences consisting of at
    most <span class="tex2jax_process">$400$</span> characters (not
    counting newline characters) spread over multiple lines. All
    words consist only of uppercase letters and the only
    punctuation is a period. The input conforms to the same text
    formatting specification mentioned above except it is not
    necessarily in triangular format.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the result of converting the input text to triangular
    form as in the description above.</p>
