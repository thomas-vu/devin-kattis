<div class="problembody">
<p>You’re playing hopscotch! You start at the origin and your
    goal is to hop to the lattice point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(N, N)$</span>. A hop consists of going from
    lattice point <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_1, y_1)$</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x_2, y_2)$</span>, where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_1 &lt; x_2$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$y_1 &lt; y_2$</span>.</p>
<p>You dislike making small hops though. You’ve decided that
    for every hop you make between two lattice points, the
    x-coordinate must increase by at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> and the y-coordinate must increase
    by at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>.</p>
<p>Compute the number of distinct paths you can take between
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0, 0)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(N, N)$</span> that respect the above
    constraints. Two paths are distinct if there is some lattice
    point that you visit in one path which you don’t visit in the
    other.</p>
<p>Hint: The output involves arithmetic mod <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9+7$</span>. Note that with <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> a prime like <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9+7$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> an integer not equal to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> mod <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$x(x^{p-2})$</span> mod <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> equals <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> mod <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a line of three integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>. You may assume <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le X, Y \le N \le 10^{6}$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>The number of distinct paths you can take between the two
    lattice points can be very large. Hence output this number
    modulo 1 000 000 007 (<span class="tex2jax_process">$10^9 +
    7$</span>).</p>
