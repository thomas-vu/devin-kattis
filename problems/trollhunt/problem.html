</div>Once upon a time in a land of yore, there was a troll who
    lived ’neath one of the land’s many stone bridges. This troll
    was quite a mischievous troll, for you see, it had a habit of
    accusing anyone crossing the bridge of having stolen the
    troll’s property (which was a somewhat curious accusation given
    that the troll had no property), the punishment of which was to
    be eaten alive. Unfortunately for the troll, eventually the
    king got wind of its questionable business model, and sent out
    the valiant knights of the High Tavern to go, shall we say,
    Queen of Hearts, on the troll.

    <p>Apprehensive of its imminent decapitation, the troll fled,
    and did not have the decency to even leave a forwarding
    address. Being a troll, it was clear that the troll was hiding
    under some other stone bridge than the one it had used for its
    shady business practice, but which? The knights decided to
    split up in groups and go search. Since a group needed to be
    able to avoid being eaten once the troll was found, each group
    had to consist of at least a certain number of knights. Each
    group of knights could search under one stone bridge per day
    (and travelling between bridges was done at lightning speed,
    thanks to the knights’ renowned iTravel™ technology). While
    clever enough to flee from its hunting ground, the troll is not
    bright enough to keep moving between different bridges: once
    the hunt starts, the troll stays in the same place. How many
    days would it take until the troll would surely have been
    found?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of a single line containing three
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$g$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \le b \le 1000$</span> is the number of
    stone bridges in the land, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le
    k \le 100$</span> is the number of knights, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le g \le k$</span> is the number of
    knights needed in each group.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a line containing a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, the number of days until the
    troll is sure to have met its destiny.</p>
