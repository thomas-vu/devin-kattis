<p>Vy is obsessed with all the little pieces of jewelry and she
    has collected so many of them. During her recent holiday trip,
    she bought even more items so she needs a new jewelry box now.
    She decided that she would make it on her own.</p>

<p>She bought a paperboard with very cute decoration which is a
    rectangle of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$X \times
    Y$</span>. She will draw a <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>-rectangle shape like the image
    above, cut and fold into a lidless box of size <span class="tex2jax_process">$a \times b \times h$</span>. Having so many
    items, Vy wants the volume of the box to be as large as
    possible. Your task is to help Vy calculate the largest
    volume.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with the number of test cases <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$T
    \leq 10\, 000$</span>). Then <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> test cases follow, each consists
    of 2 positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> printed in a single line
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$X, Y \leq 100$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case in the input, print in a single line the
    largest volume with absolute or relative error less than
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span> that Vy can
    achieve.</p>
