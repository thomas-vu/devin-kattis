<p>After returning from Wonderland, Alice needs to improve her
    scientific skills in the current digital world. Alice decides
    to participate the ACM - ICPC Asia Nha Trang Regional Contest
    2016 to evaluate her actual performance. Her favorite problem
    in the contest is described below.</p>
<p>Given an array of positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A = {a}_{1}, {a}_{2},\ldots ,
    {a}_{n}$</span>, a subarray <span class="tex2jax_process">${A}_{i}^{j}$</span> of <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> is a sequence of continuous
    elements in <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>, i.e.,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">${A}_{i}^{j} = {a}_{i},
    {a}_{i+1},\ldots , {a}_{j}$</span> (where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq j \leq $</span> n). The weight
    of <span class="tex2jax_process">${A}_{i}^{j}$</span> is the
    sum of all its elements, i.e., <span class="tex2jax_process">$\sum _{k=i}^{j} {a}_{k}$</span>.</p>
<p>Given an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>,
    your task is to find the maximum weight subarray of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> that contains only one
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> as the minimum
    element. You can assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> always contains at least one
    element with value <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of several datasets. The first line of
    the input contains the number of datasets, which is a positive
    number and is not greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>. The following lines describe the
    datasets.</p>
<p>Each dataset is described by the following lines:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>The first line contains two positive integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \leq {10}^{5}$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m \leq {2}^{6}$</span>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> positive integers, each with
        value at most <span class="tex2jax_process">${2}^{6}$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each dataset, output the maximum weight.</p>
