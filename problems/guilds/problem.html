<div class="problembody">
<p>The queen is becoming concerned at the increasing complexity
    of guilds in her land. In particular, many small guilds are
    part of larger guilds which are part of still larger guilds.
    These chains of membership have gotten in the way of her
    subjects’ duties, so she has decided to keep track of where
    each chain ends. Henceforth, all guilds must report their
    top-level guild: the guild that they are part of which is not
    itself part of a larger guild.</p>
<p>For example, if the Healing Guild is part of the Potions
    Guild which is part of the Magic Guild which in turn is part of
    the Royal Guild, then after the queen’s decree the Healing,
    Potions, and Magic Guilds will all report their top-level guild
    as the Royal Guild.</p>
<p>Given a list of which guilds are part of which other guilds,
    can you help the queen determine each guild’s top-level
    guild?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with a line containing a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 10^5$</span>. The
    next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each
    consist of two distinct space-separated guild names of up to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> lowercase English
    letters, indicating that the first (smaller) guild belongs to
    the second (larger) guild.</p>
<p>Every guild will appear at most once on the left-hand side
    of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines, and no
    chain of membership forms a cycle since the second guild
    strictly contains the first guild in each line.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line in the input, output a line in the same format
    but with the second guild replaced by the unique guild that the
    first guild is part of and which is not part of any larger
    guild.</p>
