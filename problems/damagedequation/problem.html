<p>The scientists Mildra and Gloisa have been responsible for
    exploring Luyten 726-8, but have ended up with an issue: Their
    fusion reactor has stopped working! In order to continue their
    work, they need to get some materials from the closest
    asteroid. To do that though, they need to start up the chemical
    engines, which haven’t been started for multiple centuries.</p>
<p>Gloisa has been reading the manual for the last three weeks,
    and is almost able to start it up. However, there is one
    equation she needs that has some operators smudged out. That
    equation is</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ a~ ?~ b~ =~ c~
    ?~ d \]</span>
<p>where the question marks are the unknown operators. So far,
    Gloisa has only managed to narrow the operators down to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$+$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$-$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$*$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$/$</span> (integer division).</p>
<p>Although there may be multiple valid sets of operators for
    this equation, Mildra wants to help out by making a program
    that narrows the possibility space for Gloisa.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line and only line consist of <span class="tex2jax_process">$4$</span> integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$c$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span>, the values in the expression
    above.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print out all the expressions that evaluate to true,
    separated by a newline and sorted alphanumerically.
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{`*'} &lt; \texttt{`+'}
    &lt; \texttt{`-'} &lt; \texttt{`/'}$</span>)</p>
<p>A valid expression must have a space between the integers,
    operators and the equal sign. Note that expression including
    division by zero is not a valid expression.</p>
<p>If none of the expressions are valid, print out “<tt class="ttfamily">problems ahead</tt>” (without the quotes).</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq a,b,c,d \leq
        100$</span></p>
</li>
