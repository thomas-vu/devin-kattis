<div class="problembody">
<p>A <em>Feistel network</em>, named after IBM researcher Horst
    Feistel (1915–1990), is an important structure often used in
    the design of symmetric-key ciphers known as <em>block
    ciphers</em>. A block cipher encrypts binary data in
    (relatively large) fixed-length chunks called <em>blocks</em>.
    For a block cipher based on the Feistel network structure, the
    block size must be <em>even</em>, i.e., equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$2n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is a positive integer.</p>
<p>As is the case for many block ciphers, a Feistel network
    block cipher encrypts its input block (the <em>plaintext</em>)
    to produce an output block (the <em>ciphertext</em>) by
    repeatedly applying a simpler encryption step called a
    <em>round</em>. (The number of round iterations is chosen by
    the cipher designer(s) to balance various criteria such as
    security and speed.) A single round takes in a block and
    outputs a block, i.e., it maps <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 0,1\} ^{2n}$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 0,1\} ^{2n}$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 0,1\} ^ b$</span> denotes the set of all
    <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>-bit</span> vectors. Internally, a
    round makes use of a <em>round function</em>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>, that maps <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 0,1\} ^{n}$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{ 0,1\} ^{n}$</span>, i.e., <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> operates on <em>half blocks</em>.
    Here is what happens in a single round:</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> is applied to
        the right half of the input block</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the resulting output of <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span> is combined with the left half
        of the input block via bitwise XOR (<span class="tex2jax_process">$\oplus $</span>)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the right half of the output block is the the
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-bit vector
        produced by this XOR operation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the left half of the output block is a copy of the right
        half of the input block</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Symbolically, if the <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$2n$</span>-bit</span>
    round input is denoted <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span></span>,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is the left half
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> is the right half,
    then the round output is <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$(y, x \oplus
    f(y))$</span></span>.</p>
<p>The properties of a Feistel network block cipher depend
    critically on the choice of the round function, <span class="tex2jax_process">$f$</span>, for which there are many options,
    but we will make a simplifying assumption: the round function
    is just multiplication of its <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-bit</span>
    input with a fixed <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \times
    n$</span> binary matrix, <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>.<a class="footnote" href="#a0000000006"><sup class="footnotemark">1</sup></a> Note that all
    values are restricted to <span class="tex2jax_process">$\{
    0,1\} $</span>, so any intermediate integer produced during
    vector-matrix multiplication (or matrix-matrix multiplication)
    must be reduced <span class="tex2jax_process">$(\mathrm{mod}~
    2)$</span>. For example,</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ (1
    \, \ 0 \, \ 1 \, \ 1) \begin{pmatrix} 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0
    \\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\ 1
    &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} \ = \ (1 \, \ 1\, \ 0\, \
    1) \]</span>
<p>The <em>order</em> of an <span class="tex2jax_process">$n
    \times n$</span> matrix <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> is the smallest positive integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$M^ m = I_ n$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$I_ n$</span> is the <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \times n$</span> identity matrix, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M^ m$</span> denotes
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> multiplied by itself
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> times.</p>
<p>All of this leads to a very interesting question. Given the
    order <span class="tex2jax_process">$m \geq 1$</span> of the
    matrix <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> used in the
    round function, will the cipher become the identity mapping
    after a finite number of rounds, and, if so, what is the
    minimum number of rounds required to make this happen? A cipher
    is the identity mapping if every plaintext encrypts to itself.
    For example, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$m=2$</span>,
    Figure <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> shows that
    the Feistel network cipher we have described becomes the
    identity mapping after <span class="tex2jax_process">$6$</span>
    rounds (since the plaintext, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(x,y)$</span>, is always equal to the
    ciphertext).</p>
