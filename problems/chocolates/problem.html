    of chocolates. You never know what you’re gonna
    get."</i><br/></p>
<p>Forrest Gump is a young boy who goes to Greenbow County
    Central School. As a child, he enjoys running, dancing by
    swinging his hips, and eating chocolates. Most of all, he
    enjoys spending time with his best friend Jenny. However,
    Forrest isn’t the brightest boy by conventional means. While he
    fully embraces the life wisdom that his mama often imparts
    (such as through analogies with boxes of chocolates), he still
    has trouble keeping up with his classes.<br/></p>
<p>Forrest’s math class is currently learning about shapes,
    specifically polygons. Forrest is falling behind because he
    doesn’t really understand what a polygon is. Jenny knows that
    if Forrest doesn’t keep up, his mama would have to take drastic
    measures to prevent the crooked principal, Mr. Hancock, from
    transferring Forrest to a special school. As such, Jenny has
    decided take Forrest’s schooling into her own hands.<br/></p>
<p>Jenny has decided to use something that Forrest understands
    to explain polygons to him. She picks up a box of square
    chocolates and empties the pieces onto a napkin, leaving an
    empty box with <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> rows
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> columns of empty
    cells. She places a single piece of chocolate in the box and
    says “<i class="itshape">With one chocolate here, I’ve made a
    square. A square is a polygon, Forrest.</i>"</p>

<p>Jenny added two more chocolates around the first one and
    said, “<i class="itshape">We still have here a polygon, because
    we can trace a border around the chocolates without our fingers
    leaving the surface of the box.</i>"</p>

<img alt="\includegraphics[width=100pt]{chocolates2.png}" src="/problems/chocolates/file/statement/en/img-0002.png" style="width:100pt"/>
</center>
<p>Jenny adds some more chocolates, filling up the entire box
    except a hole in the middle. “<i class="itshape">Now Forrest,
    no matter how we trace the outside box, there will always be a
    hole we can never draw unless our finger leaves the surface. So
    this here ain’t a polygon.</i>"</p>

<img alt="\includegraphics[width=100pt]{chocolates3.png}" src="/problems/chocolates/file/statement/en/img-0003.png" style="width:100pt"/>
</center>
<p>Jenny removes a chocolate from the corner and says,
    “<i class="itshape">Now we’re back to a polygon again! As long
    as we can trace the border of our chocolates without crossing
    over where we already traced, we have ourselves here a polygon.
    As we trace, we can even have two corners barely touch, so long
    as we don’t overlap any border line we’ve already gone
    over.</i>".</p>

<p>“<i class="itshape">That’s amazing Jenny. Even with just a
    small box like that, it seems like you can make so many of
    ’em</i>", said Forrest.<br/></p>
<p>“<i class="itshape">That’s right Forrest!</i>", said Jenny.
    “<i class="itshape">There’s so many ways to make a polygon
    using this box of chocolates, if I just made one at random and
    had you guess, you truly are never gonna know what you’re gonna
    get!</i>"<br/></p>
<p>“<i class="itshape">Well, Jenny. Just how many ways do you
    think are there?</i>" asked Forrest.<br/></p>
<p>“<i class="itshape">Hmm, I’m not quite sure about that
    Forrest.</i>" Jenny thought for a moment. "<i class="itshape">You really have me stumped.</i>"<br/></p>
<p>Jenny wants to impress Forrest with the answer. Given the
    dimensions of the chocolate box, can you help her count the
    number of ways? For example, a <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span> chocolate box has <span class="tex2jax_process">$13$</span> ways of forming a polygon:</p>
<pre>
   x.   .x   ..   ..   xx   x.   ..   .x   xx   .x   xx   x.   xx
   ..   ..   x.   .x   ..   x.   xx   .x   x.   xx   .x   xx   xx
</pre>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first and only line of input consists of two
    space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq R, C \leq 4$</span>), specifying the dimensions of the box
    of chocolates.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print, on a single line, the number of different ways that
    chocolates can form a single polygon in the box. Note that if
    the same polygon can be placed at multiple different places in
    the box, then all of those ways are counted separately towards
    the answer.<br/></p>
