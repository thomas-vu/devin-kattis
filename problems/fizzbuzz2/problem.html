<div class="problembody">
<p>A company is hiring a software engineer to a top secret job.
    After a lot of headhunting they now have <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> candidates left, denoted
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> after anonymization. To test the
    skills of the candidates, the company has asked them to
    implement FizzBuzz.</p>
<p>A correct implementation of FizzBuzz does the following. For
    each of the integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span>,</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>if the number is divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span>, output “fizz”,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if the number is divisible by <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, output “buzz”,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if the number is divisible by both <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, output “fizzbuzz”, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if the number is divisible by neither <span class="tex2jax_process">$3$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>, output the number itself.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the job is top secret, the company cares very much
    about the right thing being printed in the right place. Your
    task is to find the candidate whose program outputs the right
    thing at the right place the most times.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of the input consists of the integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq N \leq 1000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2
    \leq M \leq 100$</span>), the number of candidates and the
    number of values their programs should output.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each
    contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> strings
    consisting only of small letters <tt class="ttfamily">a-z</tt>
    and digits <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>-<span class="tex2jax_process">$9$</span>,
    separated by a single whitespace. The <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>’th of these lines contains the
    output from candidate <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>.
    Each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> strings in
    the output from a candidate contains at least one
    character.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Print the number of the candidate whose output has the most
    correct things printed in the correct place. In case of a tie,
    output the candidate with the lowest number.</p>
<h2>Explanation of sample 1</h2>
<p>In the example, the third candidate output the right thing
    at every place. The other two have at least one incorrect
    output, so the third candidate has the most correct words.</p>
