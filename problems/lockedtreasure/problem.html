<p>A group of <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq n \leq 30$</span>)
    bandits hid their stolen treasure in a room. The treasure needs
    to be locked away until there is a need to retrieve it. Since
    the bandits do not trust each other, they wanted to ensure that
    at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq m \leq n$</span>) of the bandits must
    agree in order to retrieve the treasure.</p>
<p>They have decided to place multiple locks on the door such
    that the door can be opened if and only if all the locks are
    opened. Each lock may have up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> keys, distributed to a subset of
    the bandits. A group of bandits can open a particular lock if
    and only if someone in the group has a key to that lock.</p>
<p>Given <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span>, how many locks are
    needed such that if the keys to the locks are distributed to
    the bandits properly, then every group of bandits of size at
    least <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> can open all the
    locks, and no smaller group of bandits can open all the
    locks?</p>
<p>For example, if <span class="tex2jax_process">$n = 3$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m = 2$</span>, only 3 locks
    are neededâ€”keys to lock 1 can be given to bandits 1 and 2, keys
    to lock 2 can be given to bandits 1 and 3, and keys to lock 3
    can be given to bandits 2 and 3. No single bandit can open all
    the locks, but any group of 2 bandits can open all the locks.
    You should also convince yourself that it is not possible to
    satisfy the requirements with only 2 locks.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input contains a positive integer
    indicating the number of cases to follow. Each case is
    specified by the two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> on one line.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line of input, print on one line the minimum number
    of locks needed.</p>
