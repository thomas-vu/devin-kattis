<div class="problembody">
<p>Edgar wants to be a hero! However, to take the Hero
    Qualification Test, he must be at least level <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>. He is currently level 0, and
    there are <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> quests
    available for him to take. Quest <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> requires him to be at least level
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$M_ i$</span> to complete, and he
    will gain <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_ i$</span> levels
    upon completing the quest. Each quest can only be done at most
    once. Additionally, due to the nature of these quests, quest
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> has a trauma level
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T_ i$</span> associated with
    it.</p>
<p>Luckily, Edgar has poor memory so he will only remember the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> most traumatic quests
    he has done! His <i class="itshape">trauma rating</i> is
    therefore the sum of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> largest trauma values among the
    quests he has done. If he does less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> quests, then his trauma rating is
    just the sum of the trauma level of all quests he has done.</p>
<p>Help Edgar determine what is the minimum trauma rating he
    needs to reach at least level <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> and take the Hero Qualification
    Test!</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input consists of a three positive
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N, K, L$</span>, the
    number of quests, the maximum number of trauma levels he can
    remember, and the minimum level he needs to reach <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1 \leq N \leq 150, 1 \leq K \leq N, 1 \leq
    L \leq 1.5 \cdot 10^{11})$</span>.</p>
<p>The following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines
    each contain three positive integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$M_ i, X_ i, T_ i$</span>, the minimum level
    Edgar needs to be to do quest <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, the number of levels he gains
    from doing it, and the trauma level of the quest <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0 \leq M_ i \leq 1.5 \cdot 10^{11}, 1 \leq
    X_ i \leq 10^9, 1 \leq T_ i \leq 150)$</span>.</p>
<p><b class="bfseries">Additional Constraint: It is guaranteed
    that Edgar will be able to reach level</b> <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span> <b class="bfseries">with the
    quests given.</b></p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single integer, the minimum trauma rating Edgar
    needs to reach at least level <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>.</p>
