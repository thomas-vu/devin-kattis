<p>You have finally realized your life-long dream: you opened
    your own chain of retail stores specializing in hard-to-find
    spatulas. Being your own boss is great – but you have to make
    all the decisions, like when your stores should be open. Being
    somewhat methodical, you decided to spend the first several
    days with the stores open all day and all night to see when the
    most profitable times are at each store. As a result, you have
    a lot of data on when people like to buy spatulas. In fact, you
    have recorded each sale and its timestamp. Now you have to
    analyze the data.</p>
<p>A store should be open when it is most profitable, so you
    want to write a program that determines the single period that
    is most profitable for each store individually. There is a
    constant cost of $0.08 per minute to keep each store running
    while it is open, and you assume there are no costs associated
    with keeping a store closed.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of several (up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$150$</span>) stores’ sales records. Each
    record starts with a line containing an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>. The next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lines each contain a
    sale from that store. Each sale has the number of minutes after
    opening (in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>
    to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\, 439$</span>) and the
    profit (a real number in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$[-100,100]$</span> with two digits after the
    decimal). The profit can be negative because sometimes you have
    loss-leader sales where your store actually loses money.
    Transactions are ordered by time, and there are never two sales
    in the same minute. Input ends when <span class="tex2jax_process">$n=0$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each store, print the maximum profit (as a real number
    with two digits past the decimal point), followed by the
    beginning and ending minutes when the profit is realized. If
    two different periods both have the maximum profit, then choose
    the shortest one, and if there are still ties, choose the
    period that starts earliest. If the store never can turn a
    profit, print <tt class="tt">no profit</tt>. Stores must open
    and close on minute boundaries.</p>
