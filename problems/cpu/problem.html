<div class="problembody">
<p>The well known hardware manufacturing company <em>Processors
    for Professors</em> is about to release a highly specialized
    CPU with exceptional functionality in, amongst other areas,
    number theory. It has, for example, an instruction <span class="sffamily">PFACT</span> that takes one parameter and returns
    all prime factors of that parameter, with an outstanding
    execution speed. It has, however, one considerable problem. The
    scientists at the testing lab has just found out that the
    <span class="sffamily">PFACT</span> instruction for some
    special input values freaks out and makes the entire processor
    explode. Even though this could be an amusing effect, it is not
    the way it was intended to work. The skilled mathematicians
    have, by trial and error, found that the explosive numbers all
    share the same interesting number theoretic properties, which
    might be of help when troubleshooting.</p>
<p>An explosive number is a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$x=p_0 p_1 p_2 \dots p_ n$</span> where all
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span>s are distinct prime
    numbers such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i =
    Ap_{i-1}+B$</span> for <span class="tex2jax_process">$i=1,2,\dots ,n$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \geq 3$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_0 \equiv 1$</span>. A and B are always
    integers, and might be different for different explosive
    numbers.</p>
<p>For example, the processor will explode when factorizing the
    number <span class="tex2jax_process">$4505$</span>, because
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$4505 = 1 \cdot 5 \cdot 17 \cdot
    53$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$5 = 3 \cdot 1 +
    2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$17 = 3 \cdot 5 +
    2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$53 = 3 \cdot 17 +
    2$</span> and the numbers 5, 17 and 53 are all prime numbers.
    In this case <span class="tex2jax_process">$A=3$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B=2$</span>.</p>
<p>You are kindly asked to write a computer program that will
    aid this company in estimating the impact of the errors, by
    calculating the amount of explosive numbers that exists within
    a given range of integers.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a row containing the number
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq N \leq 100$</span> of
    test cases that will follow. For each test case, there will be
    one row containing two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ L$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ H$</span> separated by a single space.
    These numbers are such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    \leq x_ L \leq x_ H \leq 2,000,000,000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output the number of explosive numbers
    that exist in the range <span class="tex2jax_process">$x_ L
    \leq x \leq x_ H$</span>.</p>
