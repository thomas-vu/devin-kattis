<p>Every year, several universities arrange inter-university
    national programming contests. ACM ICPC Dhaka site regional
    competition is held every year in Dhaka and one or two teams
    are chosen for ACM ICPC World Finals.</p>
<p>By observing these, MMR (Mission Maker Rahman) has made a
    plan to open a programming school. In that school, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> courses are taught. Each course is
    taught every day (otherwise, programmers may forget DP while
    learning computational geometry!). You will be given the
    starting time <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> and
    finishing time <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span>
    (inclusive) of each course <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq i \leq N$</span>). You will be also given the number of
    students registered for each course, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq N$</span>). You can safely
    assume no student has registered to two different courses. MMR
    wants to hire some rooms of a building, named <em>Sentinel
    Tower</em>, for running that school. Each room of Sentinel
    Tower has a capacity to hold as much as <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> students. The programmers
    (students) are very restless and a little bit filthy! As a
    result, when <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{course}_
    i$</span> is taken in a class room, after the class is
    finished, it takes <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{clean}_{ij}$</span> time to clean
    the room to make it tidy for starting teaching <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{course}_ j$</span> immediately just
    after <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{course}_ i$</span>
    in the same room.</p>
<p>Your job is to help MMR to decide the minimum number of
    rooms need to be hired to run the programming school.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$T
    \leq 100$</span>) denoting the number of test cases. Each case
    starts with two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq N \leq 100$</span>), number of courses and <span class="tex2jax_process">$M$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \leq M \leq 10\, 000$</span>), capacity of a room. Next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines will contain
    three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq A_ i \leq B_ i \leq 10\, 000\,
    000$</span>) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S_ i$</span>
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq S_ i \leq 10\,
    000$</span>), starting and finishing time of a course. Next
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines will contain the
    clean time matrix, where the <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>-th row will contain <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{clean}_{ij}$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq j \leq N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq \texttt{clean}_{ij} \leq 10\, 000\,
    000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$\texttt{clean}_{ii}
    = 0$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each case, print the test case number, starting from 1,
    and the answer, minimum number of rooms needed to be hired.</p>
