<p>This is a logic puzzle in which you have a square grid of
    3<span class="tex2jax_process">$\times $</span>3 cells. Each
    cell is initially either white or black. When you click on a
    square it flips, or toggles, the color of that square and the
    colors of its four immediate north, south, east and west
    neighbors that exist (they don’t exist if they would be outside
    the grid).</p>
<p>The problem is to find the minimum number of cell clicks to
    transform a grid of all white cells into the input grid (which
    is always possible). You cannot rotate the grid.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first value in the input file is an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$P \; (0&lt;P\leq 50)$</span> on a line by
    itself giving the number of problems to solve.</p>
<p>For each of the <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>
    problems, 3 lines of 3 characters describe the input grid. The
    characters in the grid descriptions are ‘*’ (for black) and ‘.’
    (for white).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each problem output a single integer giving the minimum
    number of clicks necessary to transform a grid of all white
    cells into the pattern given in the input.</p>
