<p>In many programming languages, the “plus” symbol
    (‘<tt class="ttfamily">+</tt>’) has at least two standard
    meanings:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>arithmetic addition</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>string concatenation</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Inspired by the old adage, “Variety is the spice of life,”
    the designers of the Doubleplusgood (DPG) language (launched to
    great fanfare in 1984 by the Ministry of Truth Tables) decided
    that, in certain contexts, the meaning of the plus symbol would
    be decided dynamically and <em>randomly</em> at run time. In
    particular, for expressions consisting of alternating integers
    and plus symbols, every time the same program is executed, the
    meaning of each plus symbol is randomly chosen to be either
    addition or string concatenation. It follows that a single
    expression of this form can potentially evaluate to many
    different integers. For example, consider</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ 1+9+8+4 \]</span>
<p>For clarity, we’ll use <span class="tex2jax_process">$\boxplus $</span> to denote a plus symbol
    that the DPG runtime environment decides to interpret as string
    concatenation, which, it is important to note, has higher
    precedence than addition in DPG. Then <span class="mbox" style="width:"><span class="tex2jax_process">$1+9+8+4$</span></span> can evaluate to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$7$</span> distinct
    values:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{align*}
    1\boxplus 9 \boxplus 8 \boxplus 4 \, &amp; =\, 1984\\ 1
    \boxplus 9 \boxplus 8 + 4 \, &amp; =\, 198 + 4 \, =\, 202\\ 1
    \boxplus 9 + 8 \boxplus 4 \, &amp; =\, 19 + 84 \, =\, 103\\ 1
    \boxplus 9 + 8 + 4 \, &amp; =\, 19 + 8 + 4 \, =\, 31\\ 1 + 9
    \boxplus 8 \boxplus 4 \, &amp; =\, 1 + 984 \, =\, 985\\ 1 + 9
    \boxplus 8 + 4 \, &amp; =\, 1 + 98 + 4 \, =\, 103\\ 1 + 9 + 8
    \boxplus 4 \, &amp; =\, 1 + 9 + 84 \, =\, 94\\ 1 + 9 + 8 + 4 \,
    &amp; =\, 22 \end{align*}</span>
<p>(Note that <span class="tex2jax_process">$103$</span> was
    formed in two different ways.) Given a sequence of alternating
    integers and plus symbols, your task is to determine the number
    of distinct integers to which the expression can evaluate.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a single line consisting of alternating
    positive integers and plus symbols. The line begins and ends
    with a positive integer, and is guaranteed to contain at least
    one plus symbol. The maximum number of digits in the input is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$18$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of distinct integers to which the input
    expression can evaluate in DPG.</p>
