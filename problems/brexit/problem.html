<p>A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, there was a large
    interstellar trading union, consisting of many countries from
    all across the galaxy. Recently, one of the countries decided
    to leave the union. As a result, other countries are thinking
    about leaving too, as their participation in the union is no
    longer beneficial when their main trading partners are
    gone.</p>

<p>You are a concerned citizen of country <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, and you want to find out whether
    your country will remain in the union or not. You have crafted
    a list of all pairs of countries that are trading partners of
    one another. If at least half of the trading partners of any
    given country <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span> leave
    the union, country <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>
    will soon follow. Given this information, you now intend to
    determine whether your home country will leave the union.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with one line containing four space
    separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$C$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$L$</span>. These denote the total number of
    countries (<span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq C \leq 200\,
    000$</span>), the number of trading partnerships (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq P \leq 300\, 000$</span>), the number
    of your home country (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq X
    \leq C$</span>) and finally the number of the first country to
    leave, setting in motion a chain reaction with potentially
    disastrous consequences (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq
    L \leq C$</span>).</p>
<p>This is followed by <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>
    lines, each containing two space separated integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span> satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq A_ i &lt; B_ i \leq C$</span>. Such a
    line denotes a trade partnership between countries <span class="tex2jax_process">$A_ i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B_ i$</span>. No pair of countries is listed
    more than once.</p>
<p>Initially, every country has at least one trading partner in
    the union.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing either
    “<tt class="ttfamily">leave</tt>” or “<tt class="ttfamily">stay</tt>”, denoting whether you home country leaves
    or stays in the union.</p>
