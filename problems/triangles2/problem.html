<p>Alice has once again devised a game for Bob. She would first
    scatter seeds all over the kitchen floor. Then, Bob will have
    to kneel down and trace out triangles with his finger.</p>
<p>For each triangle Bob traces out, Alice gives him a number
    of cookies equal to the square of the area of the triangle. So
    if Bob traces out a triangle with vertices <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,0)$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$(0,1)$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$(1,0)$</span>, Alice would give him
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$(\frac{1}{2})^2 =
    \frac{1}{4}$</span> cookies. Note that the number of cookies
    Alice gives Bob may not be a whole number. Bob is very excited
    because he loves cookies.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Bob cannot just trace out any triangle he
    wants. At each round, he must choose three of the seeds to form
    the vertices of his triangle. Of course, the triangle he
    chooses cannot be degenerate (have area <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span>). Furthermore, while he can reuse
    seeds from previous rounds, he cannot choose the same set of
    three seeds as he did in any of the previous rounds.</p>
<p>Alice likes watching Bob scramble around the room tracing
    triangles. She is willing to keep the game going as long as Bob
    can keep finding new triangles to draw. How many cookies can
    Bob win?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>one line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N \leq 1\, 000\, 000$</span>),
        the number of seeds;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines each with
        two integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq x,y &lt; 1\, 000\, 000$</span>),
        the coordinates of each seed.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It is possible for multiple seeds to share the same
    coordinates.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with a single integer: the maximum number of
    cookies that Bob can win, assuming that there are an infinite
    number of rounds. Round your answer to four decimal places.</p>
