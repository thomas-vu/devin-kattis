        Runners
      </div>
</div>
<p>You are the main organiser of an annual running race, where
    partipants must complete <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> laps. The prizes are even larger
    than last year, and you have attracted more partipants than
    expected.</p>
<p>Every participant has a unique start number for
    identification. In previous years, there was ample time to hand
    out start numbers on the day of the race. But this year, every
    contestant receives their start number already when they
    register. Starting numbers are handed out in increasing
    sequence, beginning from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>. As a consequence, cancellations
    lead to <em>gaps</em> in the sequence of start numbers on the
    day of the race.</p>
<p>The large number of contestants also leads to other
    logistical challenges. One is that it would take several days
    to produce the final ranking by hand, so you have decided to
    use a computer. Write a program that computes the final ranking
    from the individual lap times. The race is planned in such a
    way that all participants will be too exhausted to continue
    after <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> laps.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>: how many lap times were recorded,
    how many laps are needed to finish the race, and how many start
    numbers were handed out during registration. You can assume
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq l \leq 10^5$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq 10$</span>, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq s \leq 10^9$</span>.</p>
<p>Then follow <span class="tex2jax_process">$l$</span> lines,
    each consisting of a start number <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and a lap time in the format
    <tt class="ttfamily">mm.ss</tt>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq i \leq s$</span>. This means that the
    participant with start number <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> has completed a lap in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$mm$</span> minutes and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$ss$</span> seconds.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>One line per participant who completed the race, identified
    by start number, and ranked from fastest to slowest. If two
    partipants have the same total time, rank them by start number;
    smallest first.</p>
<h2>Points</h2>
<p>There are three test groups.</p>
