<div class="problembody">
<p>When you compute a large, factorial number, it has a long
    string of low-order zeros at the end. This makes sense; every
    time you multiply in something like a <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> or a <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>, you are sure to pick up another
    low-order zero. Thus, it’s easy to guess the low-order digit of
    something like <span class="tex2jax_process">$3\, 249!$</span>.
    It’s a little harder to guess what the lowest-order
    <em>non-zero digit</em> will be. Write a program to do
    that.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input consists of up to <span class="tex2jax_process">$1\,
    000$</span> test cases, one per line. Each test case is a
    single positive integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$i \le
    10^6$</span>. Input ends with a value of zero.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, print out the value of the rightmost
    (lowest-order) non-zero digit of <span class="tex2jax_process">$i!$</span>.</p>
