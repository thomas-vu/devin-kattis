<div class="problembody">
<p>Consider the set of all non-negative integer powers of
    3.</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$S = \{ 1, 3, 9, 27, 81,

</li>
</ul>
<p>Consider the sequence of all subsets of <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> ordered by the value of the sum of
    their elements. The question is simple: find the set at the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-th position in the
    sequence and print it in increasing order of its elements.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each line of input contains a number <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, which is a positive integer with
    no more than <span class="tex2jax_process">$19$</span> digits.
    The last line of input contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$0$</span> and it should not be processed.
    There are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span>
    test cases.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each line of input, output a single line displaying the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>-th set as described
    above, in the format used in the sample output.</p>
