<p>Vera is an astronomer studying locality of nearby star
    systems. The star systems can be thought of as 3D points in
    space. Vera would like to place a can around the stars. In
    other words, she would like to know what is the smallest volume
    cylinder that encloses the stars. The cylinder can be oriented
    in any direction. At least one base of the cylinder must have
    at least three stars.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Each input will consist of a single test case. Note that
    your program may be run multiple times on different inputs. The
    first line of input will contain a single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$4
    \le n \le 1\, 000$</span>), representing the number of
    stars.</p>
<p>Each of the next <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>
    lines will contain three integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$z$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$-1\, 000 \le x, y, z \le 1\, 000$</span>),
    representing the position of a single star. No two stars will
    be at the same position. No four stars will be coplanar.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a floating point number representing the smallest
    volume cylinder that can enclose all the stars. Your answer
    must be accurate within a relative tolerance of <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-6}$</span>.</p>
