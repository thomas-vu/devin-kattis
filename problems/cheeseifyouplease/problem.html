<p>The “We Cut The Cheese” specialty food store sells
    specialized blendings of cheeses. For example, their Italian
    Blend is made up of <span class="tex2jax_process">$50\%
    $</span> provolone, <span class="tex2jax_process">$30\%
    $</span> mozzarella and <span class="tex2jax_process">$20\%
    $</span> parmesan, while their African Safari is made up of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$74\% $</span> domiati,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$25\% $</span> areesh with just a
    hint (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\% $</span>) of
    bokmakiri. You started working at the store as a cheese blend
    taster, but two years and <span class="tex2jax_process">$45$</span> pounds later you have worked your
    way up to head of the accounting office. Every week the store
    gets various shipments of cheeses, depending on the time of
    year, market price and other factors. Given these amounts and
    the percentages required for each cheese blend, you are asked
    every week to determine the optimal use of these cheeses to
    maximize profit. When the store just made a few different
    cheese blends this could be done by hand, but with business
    expanding faster than a cheese souffle, the number of blends
    has also grown to the point where a program is now needed to
    determine the optimal use of the cheese shipments. So the
    question is: Are you gouda-nough to write such a program?</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input starts with a line containing two positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\le n,m\le 50$</span>), where <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> is the number of types of cheese
    used to make the cheese blends and <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> is the number of different cheese
    blends offered by the store. The next line contains
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_1$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_2$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_ n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0\le w_ i\le 500$</span>), where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$w_ i$</span> is the number of
    pounds of cheese type <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    that the store has on-hand. Following this are <span class="tex2jax_process">$m$</span> lines of the form <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_1$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_2$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_3$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$\ldots $</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ n$</span> <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0.0\le p_ i\le 100.0$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$0.0\le t\le 10.0$</span>), where
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p_ i$</span> indicates the
    percentage of cheese <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>
    found in the blend, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> is the profit per pound for the
    blend. Percentages are given with one decimal place, profits
    are given with two decimal places.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the maximum profit that can be obtained for the given
    pounds of cheese, blending percentages and profits, assuming
    all of the blended cheeses get sold. Round your answer to the
    nearest penny.</p>
