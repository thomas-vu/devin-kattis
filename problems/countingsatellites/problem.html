<p>Nick likes satellites. He likes them so much that he looks
    for them everywhere. One day he found a string of letters and
    counted a lot of instances of the word “<tt class="tt">SATELLITE</tt>” among all subsequences of the string.
    However the next day he forgot this string. Can you help him
    construct such a string?</p>
<p>String <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span> is a
    subsequence of string <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>
    if and only if it is possible to delete some (possibly zero)
    characters from <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> to get
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$s$</span>. Two subsequences are
    considered different if some character at a given position in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> is deleted in one
    subsequence but not the other.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The single line of input contains a single integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq k \leq 10^{18})$</span>, which is the
    number of instances of the word “<tt class="tt">SATELLITE</tt>”
    in the string Nick forgot.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a string of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$5\, 000$</span> uppercase letters. The
    string must have exactly <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> instances of the word “<tt class="tt">SATELLITE</tt>” among all its subsequences. It can be
    proven that under the given constraints a solution always
    exists. Note that the length of the string does <i class="it">not</i> have to be minimized.</p>
