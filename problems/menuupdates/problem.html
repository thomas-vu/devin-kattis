<div class="problembody">
<p>Egdirbhtel is running a successful restaurant, and every day
    has either a new recipe idea or retires an old one. The
    restaurant menu uses a unique number to represent each menu
    item in order to help customers order items efficiently.
    Unfortunately, the clientele find it confusing when a given
    number represents a menu item, Egdirbhtel retires that item,
    and soon afterwards adds a new item represented by that same
    number.</p>
<p>Egdirbhtel has come up with a solution: every positive
    integer starts out as <i class="itshape">available</i>, and
    becomes <i class="itshape">reserved</i> when it starts
    representing a new menu item. When retiring a menu item on day
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span>, the number that
    represented it stays reserved for <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> days, until it becomes available
    again on day <span class="tex2jax_process">$i+d$</span>. When
    Egdirbhtel adds a new menu item, the smallest <i class="itshape">available</i> positive integer on that particular day
    will represent it.</p>
<p>Because of the daily menu changes, Egdirbhtel would like you
    to come up with a computer program to quickly determine which
    number will represent each new item on the menu according to
    the above process.</p>
<p>The restaurant starts out with an empty menu, which might
    become empty again on some days (in which case the angry
    customers will convince Egdirbhtel to add something new to the
    next dayâ€™s menu).</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Input begins with two space-separated integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq d \leq U \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$</span>,
    where <span class="tex2jax_process">$d$</span> indicates the
    minimum number of days that need to pass after retiring a menu
    item before its number can represent a new item, and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$U$</span> indicates the total
    number of menu updates to process, with exactly one menu update
    (adding a new item to the menu or retiring an old one) per
    day.</p>
<p>The next <span class="tex2jax_process">$U$</span> lines each
    consist of either the single letter <tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>, signifying that Egdirbhtel adds a new menu
    item that day, or the letter <tt class="ttfamily">r</tt>
    followed (space-separated) by the number representing the menu
    item that Egdirbhtel retires that day. This number will always
    represent a menu item that the restaurant had at that time
    according to the process described above.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For every input line consisting of an <tt class="ttfamily">a</tt>, output a line consisting of the number
    representing the newly-added menu item. (Since the menu starts
    out empty, the output will always begin with a <tt class="ttfamily">1</tt>.)</p>
