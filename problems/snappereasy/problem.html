<p><em>Note that this is an easier version of the problem
    snapperhard</em></p>
<p>The <em>Snapper</em> is a clever little device that, on one
    side, plugs its input plug into an output socket, and, on the
    other side, exposes an output socket for plugging in a light or
    other device.</p>
<p>When a <em>Snapper</em> is in the ON state and is receiving
    power from its input plug, then the device connected to its
    output socket is receiving power as well. When you snap your
    fingers – making a clicking sound – any <em>Snapper</em>
    receiving power at the time of the snap toggles between the ON
    and OFF states.</p>
<p>In hopes of destroying the universe by means of a
    singularity, I have purchased <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> <em>Snapper</em> devices and
    chained them together by plugging the first one into a power
    socket, the second one into the first one, and so on. The light
    is plugged into the <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>th
    <em>Snapper</em>.</p>
<p>Initially, all the <em>Snapper</em>s are in the OFF state,
    so only the first one is receiving power from the socket, and
    the light is off. I snap my fingers once, which toggles the
    first <em>Snapper</em> into the ON state and gives power to the
    second one. I snap my fingers again, which toggles both
    <em>Snapper</em>s and then promptly cuts power off from the
    second one, leaving it in the ON state, but with no power. I
    snap my fingers the third time, which toggles the first
    <em>Snapper</em> again and gives power to the second one. Now
    both <em>Snapper</em>s are in the ON state, and if my light is
    plugged into the second <em>Snapper</em> it will be
    <em>on</em>.</p>
<p>I keep doing this for hours. Will the light be <em>on</em>
    or <em>off</em> after I have snapped my fingers <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> times? The light is <em>on</em> if
    and only if it’s receiving power from the <em>Snapper</em> it’s
    plugged into.</p>
<h3>Input</h3>
<p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> lines follow. Each one contains
    two integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>.</p>
<p>You may assume that <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T
    \leq 10\, 000$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N
    \leq 10$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq K
    \leq 100$</span>.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>For each test case, output one line containing “Case
    #<span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>: <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span>”, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span> is the case number (starting from
    1) and <span class="tex2jax_process">$y$</span> is either "ON"
    or "OFF", indicating the state of the light bulb.</p>
