<div class="problembody">
<p>A level is being designed for a new platform game. The
    locations of the platforms have been chosen. Contrary to
    popular opinion, platforms can’t float in the air, but need
    pillars for support. More precisely, each of the two ends of
    the platform needs to be supported by a <b class="bfseries">pillar standing on the floor or on a different
    platform</b>.</p>
<p>You will be given the locations of the platforms in a
    coordinate system as in the left image below. Each platform’s
    location is determined by its altitude (vertical distance from
    the ground) and the start and end coordinates in the horizontal
    direction. Each support pillar is placed <b class="bfseries">half a unit</b> from the end of a platform, as in
    the right image.</p>
<p>Determine the total length of pillars needed to support all
    the platforms.</p>

<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line contains the integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le N \le 100$</span>, the number of platforms.</p>
<p>Each of the following <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> lines contains the position of one
    platform, three coordinates <span class="tex2jax_process">$Y$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_1$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_2$</span>. The first number is the
    altitude, the other two the horizontal coordinates. All
    coordinates will be positive integers less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$10\, 000$</span> satisfying <span class="tex2jax_process">$X_2 &gt; X_1 + 1$</span> (i.e., the length
    of each platform will be at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$2$</span>).</p>
<p>The input will be such that no two platforms overlap.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the total length of pillars needed to support all the
    platforms.</p>
