<div class="problembody">
<p>To help with vehicle stability, the outer edge of a road in
    a curve is raised with respect to the inner edge. This is
    called superelevation and is specified as the difference in
    elevation divided by the width of the road. It needs to be
    higher for faster speeds and sharper curves.</p>
<p>The radius of a curve is the radius of the section of a
    circle along the middle of the road where the curve is
    constant. See Figure 1 for a drawing of this.</p>

<b>Figure 1</b>: Section of a circle along the middle of a
        road with radius <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>.
      </div>
</div>
<p>In some cases the curve may need a lower speed limit than
    straight portions of the road. The superelevation shouldn’t be
    more than about <span class="tex2jax_process">$.12$</span> to
    keep vehicles from sliding off the road in slippery
    conditions.</p>
<p>Your job is to calculate the maximum speed on a curve given
    the radius of the curve and the superelevation.</p>
<p>The maximum speed is given by this formula:</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\[ V = \sqrt{(R*(S+.16))/.067}, \]</span>
<p>where <span class="tex2jax_process">$V$</span> is the max
    speed in miles per hour, <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> is the radius of the curve in
    feet, and S is the superelevation.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input is a series of lines terminated by end-of-file.
    Each line will be a test case consisting of <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> separated by whitespace.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> will be an integer
    greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$99$</span> and less
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$5281$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> will be a real number
    greater than <span class="tex2jax_process">$.009$</span> and
    less than <span class="tex2jax_process">$1.0$</span>. Neither
    will have leading zeros. There are at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$100$</span> lines in input.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case output the maximum speed rounded to the
    nearest integer. It is guaranteed the answer before rounding
    will not be within <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span> of a half-integer value.</p>
