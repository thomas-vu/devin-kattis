<div class="problembody">
<p>The latest decree from the Castle in the Sky Homeowners
    Association (CSHOA) announces a new regulation where you are
    required to water your garden with at least <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> gallons of water between every
    inspection, which comes around every <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> minutes. You already have a
    working watering schedule: the Soot Sprite Sprinklers are
    configured to be on a <span class="tex2jax_process">$(t +
    b)$</span>-minute cycle, where they water your garden at
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> gallons of water per
    minute for <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span> minutes and
    then take a <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>-minute
    break. Coincidentally, the next watering cycle begins exactly
    on the next CSHOA inspection, when the new regulation will
    begin to take effect. You are lazy and would rather not change
    the sprinkler configurations if the current watering schedule
    already complies with the new regulation. Print “The CSHOA
    decrees are as murky as the Forest Spirit” if you have to
    change the configuration and “Soot Sprites sing a lullaby”
    otherwise.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The only line of input consists of five space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span>, and <span class="tex2jax_process">$r \: (1 \leq w, p, t, b, r \leq
    10^9)$</span>. <span class="tex2jax_process">$w$</span> is the
    required number of gallons of water per inspection.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> is the inspection
    interval in minutes. <span class="tex2jax_process">$t$</span>
    is the watering time per watering cycle in minutes.
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$b$</span> is the break time per
    watering cycle in minutes. <span class="tex2jax_process">$r$</span> is the rate at which the Soot
    Sprite Sprinklers water your garden in gallons per minute.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single line containing “The CSHOA decrees are as
    murky as the Forest Spirit” if you have to change the
    configuration and “Soot Sprites sing a lullaby” otherwise.</p>
