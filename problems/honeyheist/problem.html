<p>0x67 is a scout ant searching for food and discovers a
    beehive nearby. As it approaches the honeycomb, 0x67 can sense
    an area inside packed with dried honey that can be easily
    carried back to the nest and stored for winter. However, it
    must burrow through the honeycomb to reach the cell containing
    the sweet loot. If 0x67 can create a passage to the honey to
    help the other ants find it, it will do so before returning to
    the nest.</p>
<p>The cells of the honeycomb are numbered in row major order,
    so cell IDs can be assigned as shown below:</p>

</center>
</div>
<p>When 0x67 discovers the opening to the honeycomb, it enters
    the cell. Some ants are stronger than others, depending on
    their age, so 0x67 can only chew through at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> cells before its jaw wears out and
    must return to the nest to recuperate. The honeycomb is
    hexagonal, and each edge length is <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> cells. 0x67 enters through a hole
    at location <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and must
    get to the honey at location <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> by chewing a path through no more
    than <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> adjacent cells.
    Because ants can be competitive, 0x67 wants to reach the honey
    by chewing through the fewest possible cells. 0x67 can also
    sense some of the cells are hardened with wax and impossible to
    penetrate, so it will have to chew around those to reach the
    cell at location <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>.</p>

<p>Scout ants have rudimentary computational skills, and before
    0x67 begins to chew, it will work out where it needs to go, and
    compute <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>, the least
    number of cells it needs to chew through to get from
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> is the <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>th cell. If <span class="tex2jax_process">$K &gt; N$</span>, 0x67 will not be strong
    enough to make the tunnel. When 0x67 returns to the nest, it
    will communicate to its nestmates how many cells it chewed
    through to get to <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, or
    will report that it could not get to the honey.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains two lines. The first line contains five
    blank separated integers: <span class="tex2jax_process">$R~ N~
    A~ B~ X$</span></p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>: the length (number
    of cells) of each edge of the grid, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq R \leq 20$</span>. The total number
    of cells in the grid can be determined by taking a difference
    of cubes, <span class="tex2jax_process">$R^3 -
    (R-1)^3$</span>.</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span>: the maximum number
    of cells 0x67 can chew through, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq N &lt; R^3 - (R-1)^3$</span>.</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>: the starting cell
    ID, This cell is located on one of the grid edges: The cell has
    fewer than six neighbors.</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>: the cell ID of the
    cell containing the honey, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le B \le R^3 - (R-1)^3$</span>.</p>
<p><span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span>: the number of
    wax-hardened cells, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \leq
    X &lt; ( R^3 - (R-1)^3 ) - 1$</span>.</p>
<p>The second line contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$X$</span> integers separated by spaces,
    where each integer is the ID of a wax-hardened cell.</p>
<p>The ID’s, <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span>,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, and all the ID’s on
    the second line, are distinct positive integers less than or
    equal to <span class="tex2jax_process">$R^3 -
    (R-1)^3$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>A single integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span> if
    0x67 reached the honey at cell <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>, where <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> is the <span class="tex2jax_process">$K$</span>th cell, otherwise the string
    <tt class="ttfamily">No</tt> if it was impossible to reach the
    honey by chewing through <span class="tex2jax_process">$N$</span> cells or less.</p>
