<div class="problembody">
<p>In the menu to the right, you are able to download an
    English dictionary (<tt class="ttfamily">dict.txt</tt>)
    containing a sorted list of words, one per line. Your task is
    to write a program that outputs a prefix of the dictionary that
    is as long as possible.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>There is no input for this problem.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a number of lines, each containing a word from the
    dictionary. The words must form a prefix of the entire
    file.</p>
<h2>Scoring</h2>
<p>Assume that the fraction of the words you output is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$x$</span>. Then, you will be
    given <span class="tex2jax_process">$500 \cdot x$</span>
    points.</p>
<h2>Limits</h2>
<p>Your program for this task can be at most <b class="bfseries">91000</b> bytes in length. This limit includes files
    submitted along with the program.</p>
