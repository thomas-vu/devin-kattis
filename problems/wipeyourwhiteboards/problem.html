<p>You enter an empty classroom to do some homework, and you
    find out that someone did not clean the whiteboard properly.
    Apparently, the previous instruction in that room has been
    about the Extended Euclidean algorithm, because you see lots of
    intermediate results of this algorithm on the whiteboard.
    However, some parts of it have been wiped out, so you don’t see
    everything they did. In particular, you’re not sure what
    numbers they used as the inputs for the algorithm. As you
    didn’t really feel like doing your homework in the first place,
    you decide to see if you can figure out the numbers they
    started with.</p>
<p>Looking at the algorithm as executed on the whiteboard, you
    can determine one thing for certain from their intermediate
    results: given that their inputs were <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$A,
    B \geq 1$</span>, both integers), you see three integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> (with <span class="tex2jax_process">$R \geq 2$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S \leq -2$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q \geq 1$</span>), for which you know that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A \cdot R + B \cdot S =
    Q$</span>. Now, given these three numbers, you want to figure
    out the <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> they started out with.
    Unfortunately, you quickly realize that there may not be a
    single <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> pair that fit this, so
    you decide to go looking for the pair with smallest positive
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>. Finally, you decide to not
    actually bother trying to find an <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span> are intermediate results of the
    Extended Euclidean algorithm applied on <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span>: you decide you’re happy if they
    just satisfy <span class="tex2jax_process">$A \cdot R + B \cdot
    S = Q$</span>.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input starts with a line containing an integer
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq T \leq 250$</span>), the number of
    test cases. Then for each test case:</p>
<ul class="itemize">
<li>
<p>One line with three space-separated integers
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>. These satisfy <span class="tex2jax_process">$2 \leq R \leq 10^8$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$-10^8 \leq S \leq -2$</span> and
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \leq Q \leq 10^8$</span>.
        You are given that <span class="tex2jax_process">$Q$</span>
        is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of
        <span class="tex2jax_process">$R$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$S$</span>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each test case, output one line with two space-separated
    integers <span class="tex2jax_process">$A \geq 1$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$B \geq 1$</span>, the smallest
    such pair of numbers so that <span class="tex2jax_process">$A
    \cdot R + B \cdot S = Q$</span>. By the smallest pair, we mean
    the pair such that <span class="tex2jax_process">$A$</span> is
    minimal and if there are multiple such pairs the one of these
    for which <span class="tex2jax_process">$B$</span> is
    minimal.</p>
