<p>The Mischievous Troublemakers’ Association (MTA) has hatched
    a sinister plot for world domination! All through the night,
    the Troublemakers work tirelessly, arranging rocks in the shape
    of hideous, misshapen blobs on the lawns of the unsuspecting
    residents of Quackville. For the sake of efficiency, the MTA
    splits up into several factions, each of which covers a
    particular neighbourhood. The faction in charge of spreading
    doom to a given neighbourhood never visits the same lawn twice.
    While there is no consistency whatsoever as to the shapes of
    the evil rock blobs, the MTA is very specific about the number
    of rocks each blob should contain. In order to generate this
    number easily, the <span class="tex2jax_process">$k^{\mathrm{th}}$</span> faction
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$k \geq 1$</span>) has devised a
    sequence, <span class="tex2jax_process">$F_ k(n)$</span>, whose
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n^{\mathrm{th}}$</span> term
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$n \geq 1$</span>) is the number
    of rocks its members will use to make their blob on the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n^{\mathrm{th}}$</span> lawn
    they visit. This sequence can be defined recursively
    by</p><span class="tex2jax_process">\begin{align*} F_ k(1)
    &amp; = 42\\ F_ k(2) &amp; = 11k + 77\\ F_ k(n) &amp; = 2F_ k(n
    - 1) - F_ k(n - 2) + 10k \, , \ \textrm{ for } n &gt; 2
    \end{align*}</span>
<p>So, for example, the members of the first faction
    (<span class="tex2jax_process">$k = 1$</span>) place
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$42$</span> rocks on the first
    lawn they visit, <span class="tex2jax_process">$88$</span>
    rocks on the second lawn they visit, then <span class="tex2jax_process">$144$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$210$</span>, <span class="tex2jax_process">$286$</span>, and so on, on subsequent
    lawns.</p>
<p>While others stare confusedly at the amorphous piles of
    rocks, wondering what any of this has to do with world
    domination, Rex Tangleton leaps into action! Despite a complete
    lack of evidence, he is convinced that Quackvillians can only
    be saved if someone turns these ghastly blobs of doom into
    wonderful rectangles. According to Rex, a <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> by <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> rectangle of rocks is wonderful if
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> are prime. Note that he does not
    care whether or not <span class="tex2jax_process">$p$</span>
    and <span class="tex2jax_process">$q$</span> are equal. For
    each lawn that he visits, he will rearrange all of the rocks in
    the blob into a wonderful rectangle if this is possible.
    Otherwise, he will simply stare at the rocks and grunt, but not
    move any of them.</p>
<p>Originally, Rex had been planning to check as many lawns as
    possible. However, he has been informed that his grunting
    frightens people, and he will therefore not be paid for his
    work. Saving your community is no fun if you do not get
    remunerated, so Rex decides to pick random positive integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, and then check only the first
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> lawns that the
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k^{\mathrm{th}}$</span> faction
    has visited. Rex wants to know how much work lies ahead of him,
    so he has asked you to write a program that, given <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>, will determine on how many lawns
    he will rearrange rocks.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one line with two space-separated
    positive integers, <span class="tex2jax_process">$k$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>. It is guaranteed that
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$k \leq 100$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n \leq 1\, 000\,
    000$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output a single non-negative integer giving the number of
    lawns that Rex will visit on which he will rearrange rocks.</p>
