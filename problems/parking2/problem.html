</div>When shopping on Long Street, Michael usually parks his
    car at some random location, and then walks to the stores he
    needs. Can you help Michael choose a place to park which
    minimises the distance he needs to walk on his shopping round?

    <p>Long Street is a straight line, where all positions are
    integer. You pay for parking in a specific slot, which is an
    integer position on Long Street. Michael does not want to pay
    for more than one parking though. He is very strong, and does
    not mind carrying all the bags around.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The first line of input gives the number of test cases,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le t \le 100$</span>. There
    are two lines for each test case. The first gives the number of
    stores Michael wants to visit, <span class="tex2jax_process">$1
    \le n \le 20$</span>, and the second gives their <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> integer positions on Long Street,
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$0 \le x_ i \le 99$</span>.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output for each test case a line with the minimal distance
    Michael must walk given optimal parking.</p>
