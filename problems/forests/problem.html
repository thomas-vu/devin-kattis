<p>If a tree falls in the forest, and there’s nobody there to
    hear, does it make a sound? This classic conundrum was coined
    by George Berkeley (1685-1753), the Bishop and influential
    Irish philosopher whose primary philosophical achievement is
    the advancement of what has come to be called <em>subjective
    idealism</em>. He wrote a number of works, of which the most
    widely-read are <em>Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human
    Knowledge</em> (1710) and <em>Three Dialogues between Hylas and
    Philonous</em> (1713) (Philonous, the “lover of the mind,”
    representing Berkeley himself).</p>
<p>A forest contains <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span>
    trees numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span> people numbered from <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span> to <span class="tex2jax_process">$P$</span>. People may have different
    opinions as to which trees, according to Berkeley, have made a
    sound. Given who has heard which trees fall, how many different
    opinions are there? Two people hold the same opinion only if
    they hear exactly the same set of trees.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>Standard input consists of a line containing <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le P &lt; 100$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$1 \le T &lt; 100$</span> followed by at most
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$T \cdot P$</span> lines
    (terminated by end-of-file), each containing a pair of integers
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span>, indicating that person
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> has heard tree
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> fall. No pair
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$i$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$j$</span> appears more than once.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output the number of different opinions represented in the
    input.</p>
