<p>The popular streaming platform switch.tv just unveiled their
    newest feature: switch betting. Streamers can now get their
    viewers to bet on two different options using switch points
    (patented).</p>
<p>Each viewer bets some number of switch points for one of the
    two options. The total amount of switch points bet by everyone
    is called the prize pool. The streamer will choose one of the
    options as the winner and the prize pool is split (not
    necessarily equally) between all the viewers who bet on that
    option; the more you bet on the option, the more of the prize
    pool you receive. In particular, if you contributed
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p\% $</span> of all the bets for
    one of the options and that option wins, then you receive
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$p\% $</span> of the total prize
    pool.</p>
<p>The switch.tv team has come to you to compute what the
    switch point payout is for each viewer if their selected option
    wins. To do this, they ask you to find the switch-payout-ratio
    for each of the two options. Since the payout to each viewer is
    proportional to the number of switch points they put into the
    bet, the switch team will be able to use this ratio to
    determine each viewerâ€™s winnings.</p>
<p>For example, suppose a streamer created a switch bet where
    three viewers participated. Two viewers bet <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span> and <span class="tex2jax_process">$30$</span> switch points on option one and
    the last viewer bets <span class="tex2jax_process">$10$</span>
    switch points on option two. We can see that option one has
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$80$</span>% of the bets and
    option two has <span class="tex2jax_process">$20$</span>% of
    the bets.</p>
<p>If option one wins, then the two viewers who bet on that
    receive <span class="tex2jax_process">$12.5$</span> and
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$37.5$</span> switch points,
    respectively, which means that the switch-payout-ratio is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>:<span class="tex2jax_process">$1.25$</span> for option one. If option two
    wins, then the single viewer who bets on that receives 50
    switch points, which means that the switch-payout-ratio is
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$1$</span>:<span class="tex2jax_process">$5$</span>.</p>
<p>Given the percentage of total bets for option one, help
    switch.tv by computing the switch-payout-ratio for the two
    options.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input consists of one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$a$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$0
    &lt; a &lt; 100$</span>), which is the percentage of switch
    points bet on option one.</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>For each option (option one, then option two), display the
    number <tt>x</tt> such that <tt>1:x</tt> is the
    switch-payout-ratio for that option. Your answer should have an
    absolute or relative error of at most <span class="tex2jax_process">$10^{-3}$</span>.</p>
