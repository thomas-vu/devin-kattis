<p>Per is obsessed with factorials. He likes to calculate them,
    estimate them, read about them, draw them, dream about them and
    fight about them. He even has the value of <span class="tex2jax_process">$12!=479\, 001\, 600$</span> tattooed on his
    back.</p>
<p>He noticed a long time ago that factorials have many
    trailing zeroes and also wrote a program to calculate the
    number of trailing zeroes. For example <span class="tex2jax_process">$12!$</span> ends with 600, so it has 2
    trailing zeroes. Now he wants to make one step further, look at
    the 3 digits right before the trailing zeroes. In the case of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$12!$</span>, the last 3 digits
    before the trailing zeroes are <span class="tex2jax_process">$016$</span>.</p>
<h2>Task</h2>
<p>Given an integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span>,
    find the last 3 digits before the trailing zeroes in
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n!$</span>. If there are fewer
    then 3 such digits, find all of them.</p>
<h2>Input</h2>
<p>The input contains one line with one integer <span class="tex2jax_process">$n$</span> (<span class="tex2jax_process">$1\leq n\leq 10\, 000\, 000$</span>).</p>
<h2>Output</h2>
<p>Output one line with the 3 digits before trailing zeroes of
    <span class="tex2jax_process">$n!$</span>. If there are fewer
    than 3 such digits, output all of them.</p>
